77 Notes to the Group Financial Statements 1.
Authorisation of financial statements & statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC the Company and its subsidiaries together, the Group for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 2011 were approved and authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the directors on 29 February 2012.
The comparative information is presented for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010 2010.
For practical reasons, the Group prepares its financial statements to the week ending closest to the Company reference date of 31 December.
The results on this basis are unlikely to be materially different from those that would be presented for a period of one year.
The Weir Group PLC is a limited company incorporated in Scotland and is listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The consolidated financial statements of The Weir Group PLC have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal activities of the Group are described in note 3.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation These financial statements are presented in sterling.
All values are rounded to the nearest 0.1 million pounds m except when otherwise indicated.
In order to provide the users of the financial statements with a more relevant presentation of the Groups underlying performance, profit for each financial year has been analysed between: i profit before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation: and ii the effect of exceptional items and intangibles amortisation.
a Exceptional items are items of income and expense which, because of the nature, size and or infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow a better understanding of the elements of the Groups financial performance for the period and are presented on the face of the income statement to facilitate comparisons with prior periods and assessment of trends in financial performance.
Exceptional items include the movement on contingent consideration which, due to its nature, is separately disclosed on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement.
b Intangibles amortisation, including impairment, has been shown separately to provide increased visibility over the impact of increased acquisition activity on intangible assets.
Further analysis of the items included in the column Exceptional items & intangibles amortisation is provided in note 5 to the financial statements.
During the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011, the provisional fair values attributed to the 2010 acquisitions were finalised.
In accordance with IFRS3, the net impact of the adjustments to the provisional fair values has been recognised by means of a decrease to goodwill and the adjustments to the provisional amounts have been recognised as if the accounting for the business combinations had been completed at the relevant acquisition dates.
As such, all affected balances and amounts have been restated in the financial statements.
To this effect, the Consolidated Balance Sheet and affected notes present restated comparative information for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.
There was no material impact on the Consolidated Income Statement for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.
Further details of the adjustments made to the provisional fair values can be found in note 13.
The accounting policies which follow are consistent with those of the previous periods except as described below.
The following standards and interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements and have not had a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.

Accounting policies continued Use of estimates & judgements The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
Details of the significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are described in the Financial review on page 29.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results, cash flows and assets and liabilities of The Weir Group PLC and its subsidiaries, and the Groups share of its joint ventures results.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company using consistent accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled, either directly or indirectly, by the Company, where control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
The results of a subsidiary acquired during the period are included in the Groups results from the effective date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The results of a subsidiary sold during the period are included in the Groups results up to the effective date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that are not held by the Group and are presented within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from the Company shareholders equity.
Joint ventures The Group has a number of long-term contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
These all take the form of agreements to share control over other entities jointly controlled entities.
The Groups interests in the results and assets and liabilities of its jointly controlled entities are accounted for using the equity method.
These investments are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets less any impairment in value.
The income statement reflects the share of results of operations of these investments after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the investees equity, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this when applicable in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of a joint venture, representing the excess of the cost of the investment compared to the Groups share of the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities, is included in the carrying amount of the joint venture and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the joint ventures identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the cost of the investment, a gain is recognised and added to the Groups share of the joint ventures profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Foreign currency translation The financial statements for each of the Groups subsidiaries and joint ventures are prepared using their functional currency.
The functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which an entity operates.
At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the entitys functional currency at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences are recognised in the income statement except when hedge accounting is applied and for differences on monetary assets and liabilities that form part of the Groups net investment in a foreign operation.
These are recognised in other comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in profit or loss.
On consolidation, the results of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Currency translation differences, including those on monetary items that form part of a net investment in a foreign operation, are recognised in the foreign currency translation reserve.
In the event that a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement is determined after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group elected to deem cumulative currency translation differences to be nil as at 27 December 2003.
Accordingly, the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation does not include currency translation differences arising before 27 December 2003.
In the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the period.
Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is shown net of sales taxes, discounts and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from sales of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of the goods, and can be reliably measured.
Revenue from the sales of services and revenue from construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion where the outcome can be estimated reliably, otherwise it is recognised to the extent costs are incurred.
The stage of completion of a contract is determined either by reference to the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date bear to the estimated total contract costs, or by reference to the completion of a physical proportion of the contract work.
The basis used is dependent upon the nature of the underlying contract and takes into account the degree to which the physical proportion of the work is subject to formal customer acceptance procedures.
Losses on contracts are recognised in the period when such losses become probable.
Property, plant & equipment The Group elected to use previous UK GAAP revaluations of land and buildings, amounting to 10.5m, prior to 27 December 2003 as deemed cost at the date of the revaluation.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment losses.
Cost includes borrowing costs for qualifying assets for which the commencement date for capitalisation is on or after 1 January 2009.
Prior to this date, the Group recognised all borrowing costs as an expense immediately.
Freehold land and assets under construction are not depreciated.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land and assets under construction, is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost less residual value, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, to the income statement over the expected useful life of the asset concerned, which is in the following ranges: Freehold buildings, long leasehold land & buildings - 10 - 40 years Short leasehold land & buildings - duration of lease Plant & equipment - 3 - 20 years Investment property Until December 2011, the Group owned one property which was classified as investment property on the basis that it was being held to earn rentals and for capital appreciation rather than for use in the production or supply of goods and services.
This property was sold in December 2011.
Investment property was stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation was provided on a straight-line basis over 40 years.
Goodwill Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and represents any excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities determined at the date of acquisition.
Acquisition costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill in respect of an acquired subsidiary is recognised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Where the fair value of the interest acquired in an entitys assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the consideration paid, the excess is recognised immediately as a gain in the income statement.
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 27 December 2003 is recorded at its carrying amount at that date and is not amortised.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit is taken into account when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the unit.
Goodwill that was written-off directly to reserves under UK GAAP is not taken into account in determining the gain or loss on disposal of acquired businesses on or after 27 December 2003.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred is recognised at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration, which is deemed to be an asset or a liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS39 in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
In respect of business combinations prior to 1 January 2010, subsequent adjustments to contingent consideration will be recognised as part of goodwill.
80 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Other intangible assets Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any recognised impairment losses.
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured at cost on initial recognition.
An intangible resource acquired in a business combination is recognised as an intangible asset if it is separable from the acquired business or arises from contractual or legal rights, is expected to generate future economic benefits and its fair value can be measured reliably.
An intangible asset with a finite life is amortised on a straight-line basis so as to charge its cost, which in respect of an acquired intangible asset represents its fair value at the acquisition date, to the income statement over its expected useful life.
An intangible asset with an indefinite life is not amortised but is tested at least annually for impairment and carried at cost less any recognised impairment losses.
Computer software that is not integral to an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised separately as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis so as to charge the cost of the software to the income statement over its expected useful life, not exceeding eight years.
The expected useful lives of the acquired intangible assets are as follows: Brand names - indefinite life Customer relationships - 5 - 25 years Purchased software - 4 - 8 years Intellectual property & trade marks - 6 -15 years Other - up to 6 years Research & development costs All research expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred unless it relates to the development of a new product and it is incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of the product has been proven, the development costs can be measured reliably, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficient resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset.
Any such capitalised development expenditure will be amortised on a straight-line basis so that it is charged to the income statement over the expected life of the resulting product.
Impairment of non-current assets All non-current assets are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying values might be impaired.
Additionally, goodwill, intangible assets with an indefinite life and any capitalised development expenditure are subject to an annual impairment test.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that an assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount, which represents the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
An assets value in use represents the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset.
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment test is conducted for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Similarly, the recoverable amount of goodwill is determined by reference to the discounted future cash flows of the cash-generating units to which it is allocated.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in previous periods for an asset other than goodwill are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount.
The carrying amount of an asset shall not be increased above the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior periods.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value, with due allowance for any obsolete or slow moving items.
Cost represents the expenditure incurred in bringing inventories to their existing location and condition and comprises the cost of raw materials, direct labour costs, other direct costs and related production overheads.
Raw material cost is generally determined on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less costs to complete and sell.
Financial assets & liabilities The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, short-term borrowings, loans and fixed rate notes, cash and short-term deposits.
The Group also has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its operations.
A financial asset is generally derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is settled, sold, cancelled or expires.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, such that the difference in the respective carrying amounts together with any costs or fees incurred are recognised in profit or loss.
Accounting policies continued Trade receivables Trade receivables, which generally are of a short dated nature, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Cash & cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, deposits available on demand and other short-term highly liquid investments with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less and bank overdrafts and short-term borrowings with a maturity on acquisition of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are presented as current liabilities to the extent that there is no right of offset with cash balances.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount.
Interest-bearing loans & borrowings Obligations for loans and borrowings are recognised when the Group becomes party to the related contracts and are measured initially at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Provisions A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, the obligation can be estimated reliably and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Derivative financial instruments & hedge accounting The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps, to reduce its exposure to exchange rate movements.
The Group also uses foreign currency borrowings as a hedge of its exposure to foreign exchange risk on its investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivatives for speculative or trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised as assets and liabilities measured at their fair values at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on spot and forward foreign exchange rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
Changes in their fair values have been recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used, provided the conditions specified by IAS39 are met.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of hedge relationships where it is both permissible under IAS39 and practical to do so.
When hedge accounting is used, the relevant hedging relationships will be classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a fair value hedge, the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability will be adjusted by the increase or decrease in its fair value attributable to the hedged risk and the resulting gain or loss will be recognised in the income statement where, to the extent that the hedge is effective, it will be offset by the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument.
Where the hedging relationship is classified as a cash flow hedge or as a net investment hedge, to the extent that the hedge is effective, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument will be recognised directly in other comprehensive income rather than in the income statement.
When the hedged item is recognised in the financial statements, the accumulated gains and losses recognised in other comprehensive income will be either recycled to the income statement or, if the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, will be recognised as adjustments to its initial carrying amount.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is kept in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are recognised separately as derivative financial instruments when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract and the host contract is not stated at its fair value with changes in its fair value recognised in the income statement.
82 The Weir Group PLC Annual Report & Financial Statements 2011 Financial statements Notes to the Group Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Share-based payments Equity settled share-based incentives are provided to employees under the Groups Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP and as a consequence of occasional one-off conditional awards made to senior executives.
The Group recognises a compensation cost in respect of this plan that is based on the fair value of the awards.
The fair value is determined at the date of grant and is not subsequently re-measured unless the conditions on which the award was granted are modified.
The fair value at the date of the grant is calculated using appropriate option pricing models and the cost is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Adjustments are made to reflect expected and actual forfeitures during the vesting period due to failure to satisfy service conditions or performance conditions.
As permitted by IFRS1, the Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based Payment retrospectively only to equity settled awards that were granted on or after 7 November 2002 and had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
Treasury shares The Weir Group PLC shares held by the Company are classified in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken directly to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in total comprehensive income on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Post-employment benefits Post-employment benefits comprise pension benefits provided to employees throughout the world and other benefits, primarily post-retirement healthcare, provided to certain employees in the United States.
For defined benefit plans, the cost is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is recognised over the average expected remaining service lives of participating employees, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Past service costs resulting from enhanced benefits are recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, or immediately if the benefits have vested.
Actuarial gains and losses, which represent differences between the expected and actual returns on the plan assets and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in full in the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet comprises the net total for each plan of the present value of the benefit obligation, using a discount rate based on appropriate high quality corporate bonds, at the balance sheet date, minus any past service costs not yet recognised, minus the fair value of the plan assets, if any, at the balance sheet date.
Where a plan is in surplus, the asset recognised is limited to the amount of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount which the Group expects to recover by way of refunds or a reduction in future contributions.
For defined contribution plans, the costs represent the Groups contributions to the plans and these are charged to the income statement in the period in which they fall due.
Leases Leases which transfer to the Group substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance leases.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are included within property, plant and equipment, initially measured at their fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments and a corresponding liability is recognised within obligations under finance leases.
Subsequently, the assets are depreciated on a basis consistent with similar owned assets or the lease term if shorter.
At the inception of the lease, the lease rentals are apportioned between an interest element and a capital element so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the outstanding liability.
Subsequently, the interest element is recognised as a charge to the income statement while the capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding liability.
Operating lease rentals and any incentives receivable are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Taxation Current tax is the amount of tax payable or recoverable in respect of the taxable profit or loss for the period.
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base with the following exceptions: i Deferred tax arising from the initial recognition of goodwill, or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination, that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, is not recognised: ii Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future: iii A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unutilised tax losses and the carry forward of unused tax credits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except if it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised directly in equity.
Accounting policies continued New standards & interpretations The International Accounting Standards Board and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued the following standards and interpretations, which are considered relevant to the Group, with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
Effective date for International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS periods commencing IAS1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income Amendments to IAS1 1 July 2012 IAS12 Income Taxes Amendment - Deferred Taxes: Recovery of Underlying Assets 1 January 2012 IAS19 Employee Benefits Revised 1 January 2013 IFRS7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment 1 July 2011 IFRS9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2013 IFRS10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IFRS11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities 1 January 2013 IFRS13 Fair Value Measurement 1 January 2013 Not yet adopted for use in the European Union.
The above standards and interpretations will be adopted in accordance with their effective dates and have not been adopted in these financial statements.
The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Segment information For management purposes, the Group is organised into three operating divisions: Minerals, Oil & Gas and Power & Industrial.
These three divisions are organised and managed separately based on the key markets served and each is treated as an operating segment and a reportable segment under IFRS8.
The operating and reportable segments were determined based on the reports reviewed by the Chief Executive which are used to make operational decisions.
The Minerals segment designs and manufactures pumps, hydrocyclones, valves and other complementary equipment for the mining, flue gas desulphurisation and oil sands markets.
The Oil & Gas segment manufactures pumps and ancillary equipment and provides aftermarket support for the global upstream and downstream oil and gas markets.
The Power & Industrial segment designs, manufactures and provides aftermarket support for rotating and flow control equipment to the global power generation and industrial sectors.
All other segments, which are disclosed as Group companies, include the results of Liquid Gas Equipment which supplies equipment to the liquefied petroleum gas marine and onshore markets.
The Chief Executive assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit from continuing operations before exceptional items and intangibles amortisation, including impairment segment result.
Finance income and expenditure and associated interest-bearing liabilities and derivative financial instruments are not allocated to segments as all treasury activity is managed centrally by the Group treasury function.
The amounts provided to the Chief Executive with respect to assets and liabilities are measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
The assets are allocated based on the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset.
The liabilities are allocated based on the operations of the segment.
Transfer prices between business segments are set on an arms length basis in a manner similar to transactions with third parties.

Discontinued operations There were no disposals of businesses during the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 or the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010.
In December 2011, the Group disposed of the former Weir Pumps site at Cathcart to SPX Clyde UK Limited for cash proceeds of 25.0m resulting in a net gain of 19.9m net of tax of nil after taking account of disposal costs and other costs arising from discontinued operations.
Since the property was used by the Weir Pumps business, which was sold in 2007, the net gain is shown as a profit from discontinued operations.
In December 2010, the Group pleaded guilty to two charges of breaching UN sanctions in connection with a number of Oil for Food programme contracts awarded between 2000 and 2002.
This resulted in a confiscation order of 13.9m and a fine of 3.0m.
Since the business involved was sold in 2007, these costs, along with 1.7m of related legal and professional fees, offset by the release of 5.0m of provision and accruals, were shown as a loss from discontinued operations.
Earnings losses per share from discontinued operations were as follows.
2011 2010 pence pence Basic 9.4 6.5 Diluted 9.3 6.4 These earnings losses per share figures were derived by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company from discontinued operations of 19.9m 2010: loss of 13.6m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts shown in note 9.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the period attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the effects of dilutive share awards.
The following reflects the profit and share data used in the calculation of earnings per share.

This has been treated as an adjustment to goodwill on the basis that the acquisition occurred before IFRS3 Revised was adopted by the Group.
Brand names have been assigned an indefinite useful life and as such are not amortised.
The carrying value of 140.7m 2010: 141.3m is tested annually for impairment note 14.
The brand name value comprises the brands of Weir Linatex, Weir BDK, Weir American Hydro, Weir Warman, Weir SPM, Weir Gabbioneta, Weir Mesa and Weir Multiflo, all of which were recognised at fair value at their respective dates of acquisition.
Weir Warman has a long history in the minerals and mining market and is considered to be a market leader.
Weir SPM and Weir Gabbioneta brands both have long histories in the oil and gas markets where they are both considered to be market leaders.
The Weir Linatex brand enjoys strong recognition within the mining and sand and aggregates markets globally.
The allocation of customer relationships and the remaining amortisation period of these assets is as follows.

Business combinations On 1 July 2011, the Group acquired a majority interest in the South Korean valves business formerly operated by HIM Tech Co Ltd.
The Group acquired 60% of the voting shares of a new Korean company, Weir International Co. Ltd Weir International, into which the HIM Tech valves business has been transferred.
Located in Ansan, near Seoul, the business designs and manufactures control and choke valves for severe service power generation and oil and gas applications.
The acquisition was structured as an initial 60% purchase including an earn out based on EBITDA achieved in 2013 and 2014.
The remaining 40% is subject to put and call options exercisable between 2014 and 2019 and based upon an EBITDA multiple of profits in the two years preceding the exercise of the option.
The cash consideration paid was 9.8m and the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration is 14.0m.
This is based on an assessment of the probability of possible outcomes discounted to net present value.
The range of possible outcomes on an undiscounted basis is between zero and 33.4m.
Costs associated with the acquisition amounting to 0.5m have been charged to the income statement in the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011.
On 14 December 2011, the Group finalised the acquisition of 100% of the voting shares of Seaboard Holdings Inc. Weir Seaboard, an independent wellhead solutions provider focused on the growing North American unconventional oil and gas drilling and production markets, based in Houston, Texas, for a total cash consideration of 432.1m.
In addition, an amount of 9.1m has been recognised in respect of contingent consideration relating to tax refunds.
Costs associated with the acquisition amounting to 5.1m have been charged to the income statement in the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011.
The fair values on acquisition of these business combinations are provisional due to the timing of the transactions and will be finalised during the following financial year.
No allocation has been made in the determination of the provisional fair values from goodwill to identifiable intangible assets.
External advisers are assisting with this allocation, the process has commenced and initial draft reports are due in April 2012.
This allocation will be finalised along with all other fair values in the next financial year.
There will be certain intangible assets included in the 403.2m of goodwill recognised that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include anticipated business growth, synergies and an assembled workforce.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The provisional fair value of the trade receivables amounts to 41.2m.
The gross amount of trade receivables is 43.3m.

The YES acquisition was structured as an initial 76% purchase with the remaining 24% being subject to a put and call option exercisable between 2014 and 2016 and based upon an EBITDA multiple of profits in the two years preceding the exercise of the option.
The contingent consideration recognised at the acquisition date was estimated at 12.0m m14m based on an assessment undertaken shortly after the acquisition date of the probability of the possible outcomes discounted to net present value.
In conjunction with the finalisation of the provisional fair values, the contingent consideration payable has been reduced to 1.7m.
In the 2010 annual report and accounts, the fair values on acquisition of the above businesses were provisional, with the exception of PCS, due to the timing of the transactions.
The fair values have been finalised in 2011 resulting in adjustments to the provisional fair values attributed.
The following table summarises the adjustments made to the provisional fair values during the measurement period.
Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives Goodwill acquired through business combinations and intangible assets with indefinite lives have been allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The current year acquisition of Weir Seaboard has been determined to be a separate CGU and Weir International has been allocated to Other.
The previous year acquisitions have been allocated to Other with the exception of Linatex which has been allocated to the Warman companies CGU.
The amounts allocated as Other are not considered significant in comparison to their respective total carrying amounts.
The carrying amount of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives has been allocated as per the table below.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that these might be impaired.
The basis of these impairment tests including key assumptions are set out in the table below.

The WACC is the weighted average of the pre-tax cost of debt financing and the pre-tax cost of equity finance.
In the main there has been a decrease in the WACC relative to 2010 in mature economies largely due to a reduction in government bond yields being only partially offset by an increase in credit spreads.
The increase in credit spreads in emerging economies has been compounded by an increase in government bond yields on 2010 levels.
The WACC in relation to Weir Gabbioneta has increased significantly on 2010, driven by the increase in Italian government bond yields.
2 Real growth Real growth beyond the five year forecast period of 1.2%, for all businesses except South Africa where a rate of 4.0% is used, reflects the increasingly global nature of these businesses and the fact that they sell a significant proportion of their products to emerging markets which have long-term stronger growth prospects than their home markets.
3 EBIT margins EBIT margins have been forecast based on historic levels taking cognisance of the likely impact of changing economic environments and competitive landscapes on volumes and revenues and the impact of associated management actions on costs.
4 Weir Seaboard Weir Seaboard is a wellhead solutions provider focused on the growing North American unconventional oil and gas drilling and production markets.
Demand for Weir Seaboards products and services is closely related to the number of conventional and unconventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
Independent forecasts of North American oil and gas well drilling activity, which take into account forecast oil and natural gas prices and storage levels, have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
These independent forecasts were prepared during the final quarter of 2011.

Impairment testing of goodwill & intangible assets with indefinite lives continued 5 Weir SPM Weir SPM is a supplier of oil and gas well service pumps, associated flow control equipment and services to the oil and gas production industry.
A large proportion of the businesss revenues are generated in North America with demand being closely related to the number of conventional oil drilling rigs and gas well drilling rigs in operation which is in turn dependent upon oil and natural gas prices and storage levels.
6 Warman companies The Warman companies supply pumps and associated equipment and services to all global markets.
The key drivers for revenues are i levels of mining capital expenditure which drives demand for original equipment and ii levels of actual mining activity which drives demand for spare parts and service.
Independent forecasts of mining capital expenditure and activity have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
7 Weir Gabbioneta Weir Gabbioneta is a supplier of heavy duty process applications to oil and gas refinery, petro-chemical and power generation industries.
The key drivers for revenues are capital expenditure within oil refinery and petro-chemical industries.
Independent forecasts of expenditure in these sectors have been used to derive revenue growth assumptions.
Sensitivity analysis Base case forecasts show significant headroom above carrying value for each of the CGUs with the exception of Weir Gabbioneta.
Sensitivity analysis has been undertaken for each CGU to assess the impact of any reasonable possible changes in key assumptions.
Other than in relation to Weir Gabbioneta, there is no reasonably possible change that would cause the carrying values to exceed recoverable amounts.
With regard to Weir Gabbioneta, downside sensitivities have been assessed and, although headroom exists between the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and their value in use, this headroom is much reduced.
As at 30 December 2011, the headroom is 10.2m.
The main drivers for this are the increased competition in the markets the business operates in and an increase of over 300 basis points in the discount rate applied when compared to 2010, the latter being driven by macro-economic conditions in the Eurozone.
The headroom existing in the base case would be eliminated with the CGU at breakeven if the discount rate were to increase by a further 150 basis points or if operating cashflows in year 1 of the forecast period were to reduce by 40%.

All bank loans and fixed rate notes are unsecured and rank pari passu.
As part of the acquisition of Weir Seaboard the Group entered into two bank loans.
Firstly a US$300m term loan, amortising in equal instalments semi-annually to 22 September 2014.
Secondly a US$380m bridging loan repayable at the earlier of 23 May 2013 or 7 days after a Debt Capital Markets issue.
As at 30 December 2011 both these facilities were fully drawn.
These new facilities are in addition to the Groups existing US$800m multi-currency revolving credit facility which was entered into in 2010.
As at 30 December 2011, 163.0m was drawn under the revolving credit facility.
On 16 February 2012, the Group issued US dollar denominated fixed rate notes via a Private Placement to US investors totalling US$1bn.
The notes were US$210m of seven year, US$590m of ten year and US$200m of eleven year notes.
The average coupon payable is 4.16%.
Following this issue, the Group repaid in full the US$380m bridging loan.

Provision has also been made in respect of sales contracts entered into for the sale of goods in the normal course of business where the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contracts exceed the economic benefits expected to be received from the contracts.
Provision is made immediately when it becomes apparent that expected costs will exceed the expected benefits of the contract.
It is expected that all costs will have been incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Employee related Employee related provisions arise from legal obligations and asbestosis claims and are based on managements best estimate of the likely costs.
It is expected that the costs will be incurred in the period up to 2021.
Discontinued operations warranty & indemnity Provisions in respect of discontinued operations include provision for warranty and indemnity exposures under asset and share sale agreements.
The provision as at 30 December 2011 is based on managements current best estimate of the remaining liabilities.
The actual outcome may differ and, in some cases, this may be dependent on the outcome of legal proceedings.
It is expected that the majority of these costs will be incurred within two years of the balance sheet date with the remaining costs expected to be incurred within five years of the balance sheet date.
Other Other provisions relate to an environmental clean up programme in the United States for a company acquired in 1992, restructuring costs and various other legal claims and exposures across the Group.
The environmental provision is based on managements current best estimate of the expected costs under the programme.
It is expected that these costs will be incurred in the period up to 2019.

Deferred tax asset balances for unused tax losses of 1.6m 2010: 1.9m have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence that these assets will be recoverable.
These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb these tax benefits.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 10.7m 2010: 11.6m have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
Temporary differences associated with Group investments A deferred tax liability of 27.1m 2010: 21.7m has been recognised in respect of taxes on the unremitted earnings of the South American and Canadian subsidiaries.
As at 30 December 2011, this is the only recognised deferred tax liability in respect of taxes on unremitted earnings as the Group does not foresee a distribution of unremitted earnings from other subsidiaries or joint ventures which would result in a reversal of deferred tax.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures, for which a deferred tax liability has not been recognised, aggregate to 1,095.0m 2010: 820.9m.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement.
The Finance Act 2011 enacted legislation to reduce the UK corporate rate of taxation from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by the financial year beginning 1 April 2014.
These further changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in the consolidated results for the 52 weeks ended to 30 December 2011.
We expect that these reductions will not have a material effect on the effective tax rate or on the profit for the year in future periods.

Pensions & other post-employment benefit plans The Group has five defined benefit pension plans in the UK and North America.
All defined benefit plans are closed to new members.
The most significant of the defined benefit plans are the two UK plans.
Contribution salary in respect of the Groups main UK plan is capped and will increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% per annum and the United States plans are frozen.
The Group also provides certain additional post-retirement healthcare benefits to senior employees in the United States.
The assets and liabilities of the plans are as follows.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the period are analysed as follows.

The total contributions to the defined benefit plans in 2012 are expected to be 9.5m.
Plan assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of plan assets and allowing for plan expenses.

The past service gain of 19.0m has arisen as a result of a decision by the Trustees of The Weir Group Pension and Retirement Saving Scheme that, following the Governments recent change in legislation, certain elements of pension will now increase in line with Consumer Prices Index CPI rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI.
This decision was announced to the members of the scheme in July 2011.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension plan deficits are attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension plans.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised on an IFRS basis in other comprehensive income before 27 December 2003.

Financial assets & liabilities Financial risk management objectives & policies The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those relating to foreign currency, liquidity and credit risk.
Foreign currency transactional risk arises when operating subsidiaries enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies.
Translational risk arises on the translation of overseas earnings and investments into sterling for consolidated reporting purposes.
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract and liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
In addition, the Group is subject to a degree of interest rate risk on its borrowings.
The Group uses financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, to hedge certain foreign exchange and interest rate risks as set out below.
Foreign exchange risk policy Foreign currency transactional and translational risk could result in volatility in reported consolidated earnings and net assets.
In respect of transactional foreign currency risk, the Group maintains a policy that all operating units eliminate exposures on material committed transactions, usually by undertaking forward foreign currency contracts through the Groups treasury function.
In addition, it is Group policy that those companies where the most significant concentration of foreign exchange risk has been identified also apply hedge accounting in accordance with IAS39.
Therefore, some of the Groups forward foreign currency contracts form part of an effective cash flow hedge.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the forward foreign currency contracts which form part of a cash flow hedge will have an impact on shareholders equity.
Exchange rate fluctuations in respect of the other forward foreign currency contracts will have an impact on profit or loss.
It is Group policy not to engage in any speculative transaction of any kind.
In respect of translational risk, the Group has a policy to partially hedge United States dollar US$ net assets exposure.
This is achieved through designating an element of US dollar borrowings, forward foreign currency contracts and cross currency swaps as net investment hedges against the Groups US dollar investments.
The Group does not hedge the translational exposure arising from profit and loss items.
Liquidity risk policy Liquidity risk could impact negatively on the Groups reputation, borrowing costs or ultimately its ability to continue as a going concern.
Liquidity risk is managed by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that sufficient committed facilities are in place to meet possible downside scenarios.
The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans and fixed rate notes.
Further details of the Groups borrowing facilities are disclosed in note 20. Credit risk policy Credit risk could have a negative impact on reported earnings and cash and consequently the liquidity of the Group.
The Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables with risk spread over a large number of countries and customers, with no significant concentration of risk.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risk by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
Credit worthiness checks are also undertaken with external credit rating agencies before entering into contracts with new customers and credit limits are set as appropriate and adhered to.
As shown in note 17, the trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowance for doubtful debts.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identifiable loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Groups exposure to the credit risk of financial institutions is limited by the adherence to counterparty limits and by only trading with counterparties that have a strong credit standing based upon ratings provided by the major agencies.
Interest rate risk policy The Groups borrowings are in a combination of fixed and variable rates of interest.
Interest rate risk is regularly monitored to ensure that the mix of variable and fixed rate borrowing is appropriate for the Group in the short to medium-term.
On 23 November 2011, the Group entered into a new 3 year term loan of US$300m and a new 18 month US$380m bridging loan.
This reduced the proportion of fixed rate borrowings from 44% as at 31 December 2010 to 20% as at 30 December 2011.
On 16 February 2012, the Group issued US$1bn of fixed rate notes to the US private placement market with maturities of seven years US$210.0m, ten years US$590.0m and eleven years US$200.0m.
On receipt of these funds, the Group repaid the US$380.0m bridging loan and reduced the proportion of floating rate borrowings.
This matured when the notes were issued.
Net investment in foreign operations As at 30 December 2011, US dollar fixed rate notes of US$160.0m 2010: US$160.0m and US dollar variable rate loans of US$926.5m 2010: US$322.5m, both included in interest-bearing loans and borrowings, cross currency swaps of US$254.0m 2010: US$334.0m and net forward foreign currency liability contracts of US$48.0m 2010: US$48.0m have been designated as a hedge of the Groups exposure to translational foreign exchange risk on its net investments in Weir SPM, Weir Warman and Weir Seaboard.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings and the fair value of the cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in these subsidiaries.

The derivative financial instruments are valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs including spot and forward foreign exchange rates and interest rate curves.
The fair value of cross currency swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on interest rate curves and spot foreign exchange rates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
At 30 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the Group held all financial instruments at level 2 fair value measurement.
During the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 and the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2010, there were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 fair value measurements and no transfers into and out of level 3 fair value measurements.
The fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables approximate their carrying amount due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.
The fair value of borrowings and obligations under finance leases is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt on similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.

Financial assets & liabilities continued The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax and equity through the impact on floating rate borrowings and cross currency swaps in respect of each currency to which the Group has a significant exposure to interest rate risk.

Effect of hedging & derivative financial instruments included in the income statement & equity The Group uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge currency risk associated with expected future sales or purchases for which the Group has firm commitments.
The terms of the forward foreign currency contracts are negotiated to match the terms of the commitments.
Within the Group, two subsidiaries apply cash flow hedge accounting to these transactions.
Any gains and losses on ineffective hedges were taken to the income statement in the period.
All other forward foreign currency contracts, while representing commercial hedges, are not subject to cash flow hedge accounting with all fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The net carrying amount, maturity dates and the amounts recognised for the period in profit or loss and equity for each derivative financial instrument are set out below.

The Groups forward foreign currency contracts subject to cash flow hedge accounting which were deemed to be ineffective during the period resulted in a net charge to the income statement of nil 2010: 0.3m.
The interest rate swaps which were used by the Group to convert borrowings from floating to fixed rates of interest matured during 2010.
In 2010 there was no ineffectiveness in relation to the Groups interest rate swaps.
Financial assets & liabilities continued Foreign exchange risk The Group considers the most significant foreign exchange risk relates to the Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, Euro and United States dollar.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in these foreign currency exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The sensitivity analysis shows the effect on profit or loss in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency, including payables, receivables, borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts but excluding all financial assets and liabilities qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges.
The sensitivity analysis also shows the effect on equity in respect of financial assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency qualified as either cash flow or net investment hedges including forward foreign currency contracts, borrowings and cross currency swaps.
The sensitivity analysis adjusts the translation of each respective financial asset or liability at the financial year end for a 25% strengthening of sterling against the relevant exchange rates.

Capital management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure that it maintains robust capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators.
Gearing ratio Gearing comprises net debt divided by total equity.
Net debt comprises cash and short-term deposits and interest-bearing loans and borrowings note 26.

For the purposes of the covenants required by the Groups lenders, the net debt is to be converted at the exchange rate used in the preparation of the Groups income statement and cash flows, ie.
In addition, profits of businesses acquired in the financial year have to be included as if the acquisitions occurred at the start of the financial year.
The covenant calculations for the purposes of the Groups lenders are shown below.
