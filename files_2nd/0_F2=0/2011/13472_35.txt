128 Rio Tinto 2011 Annual report Governance Taxation of capital gains Subject to the PFIC rules discussed below, if you are a US holder and you sell or otherwise dispose of the Groups ADSs or shares, you will recognise capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount that you realise and your tax basis, determined in US dollars, in your shares or ADSs.
Capital gain of a non-corporate US holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the holder has a holding period greater than one year.
The gain or loss will generally be income or loss from sources within the US for foreign tax credit limitation purposes.
Passive Foreign Investment Company PFIC Rules We believe that the Groups shares or ADSs should not be treated as stock of PFIC for US federal income tax purposes, but this conclusion is a factual determination that is made annually and thus may be subject to change.
If we were to be treated as a PFIC, unless the shares or ADSs are marketable stock and a US holder elects to be taxed annually on a mark-to-market basis with respect to the shares or ADSs, gain realised on the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs would in general not be treated as capital gain.
Instead, if you are a US holder, you would be treated as if you had realised such gain and certain excess distributions rateably over your holding period for the shares or ADSs and would be taxed at the highest tax rate in effect for each such year to which the gain was allocated, together with an interest charge in respect of the tax attributable to each such year.
In addition, dividends that you receive from us will not be eligible for the special tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income if we are a PFIC either in the taxable year of the distribution or the preceding taxable year, but instead will be taxable at rates applicable to ordinary income.
