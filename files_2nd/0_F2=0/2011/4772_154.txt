Group Accounts Dignity plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 65 | 9Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The recoverable amount of a CGU is based on a valueinuse calculation.
However, the assets allocated to head office are tested for impairment by reference to the Group as a whole.
The valueinuse calculations use cash flow projections based on the latest management expectations.
Key assumptions used to produce the annual budget are the estimated UK death rates based on historical death rates supplied by ONS, anticipated market share based on actual experience and anticipated price increases based on actual experience.
Cash flows beyond the initial 12 month period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.25 per cent 2010: 2.25 per cent.
The cash flows are discounted at a pretax rate of 10.2 per cent 2010: 9.2 per cent.
This rate is used to analyse each CGU because they all have similar risk profiles.
Based on these calculations, the discount rate would have to increase to at least 20 per cent 2010: 19 per cent, or the growth rate would have to reduce to at least minus 9 per cent 2010: minus 9 per cent to result in any impairment of goodwill, intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and working capital.
On the basis of the above, the review indicated that no impairment arose in any segment 2010: nil.
Included within plant, machinery, fixtures and fittings net book value is 7.3 million 2010: 8.9 million relating to assets held in the course of construction.
In 2011, borrowing costs of 0.6 million 2010: 0.2 million were capitalised as components of the cost of construction of qualifying assets, applying an annualised average capitalisation rate of 6.9 per cent 2010: 6.7 per cent.
Details of any securities over assets are disclosed in note 30.
