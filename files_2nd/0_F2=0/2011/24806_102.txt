The differences are explained below: Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 23,987 138,496 Net return on ordinary activities multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 26.5% 2010 28% 6,356 38,779 Capital returns not taxable 6,645 38,724 Dividends not subject to UK tax 2,117 1,637 Overseas withholding tax 144 154 Movement in excess management expenses 1,828 1,582 Current tax charge for the year 144 154 As an Investment Trust, the Companys capital gains are not taxable.
There is no UK corporation tax charge at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010 as the Company has unrelieved management expenses which are available to be carried forward.
The tax charge for 31 December 2011 and 2010 comprises overseas withholding taxes written off.
At 31 December 2011 the Company had surplus management expenses of 35 million 2010 28 million which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.
