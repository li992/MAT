The directors consider that this presentation appropriately reflected the economic substance.
Following discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel, these advances have now been reported in creditors due after more than one year because the Company did not have a strict legally enforceable right of set off, as required by accounting standards.
Only advances due to subsidiaries where there is an unambiguous legal right of set off are now offset against advances due from subsidiaries.
As a result, the amounts of investments and advances and creditors falling due after more than one year have been restated.
Investments and advances at 31 July 2010 have increased by 500.3m, with a corresponding increase in creditors due after more than one year, and total assets less current liabilities have increased by 500.3m to 3,834.1m.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account, net current assets, net assets or shareholders equity in the current or previous financial year.
The change in presentation has no impact on the 31 July 2011 balance sheet because the Group re-organised these inter-group advances during the year.

8 Post-retirement benefits The Company operates three defined benefit plans in the UK.
The largest of them is a funded scheme with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
The Company is the sole employer in that scheme and, accordingly, accounts for it as a defined benefit pension plan, in accordance with FRS 17.
The UK defined benefit pension schemes were closed with effect from 31 October 2009.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the funded scheme was performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2009.
This has been rolled forward to 31 July 2011.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 Rate of increase in salaries n a n a Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.4% 4.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5% 3.2% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.5% 3.2% Discount rate 5.3% 5.4% Inflation rate 3.5% 3.2% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% 5.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within each scheme.
The assumptions are based on the SAPS All Birth tables with relevant scaling factors based on the experience of the schemes.
The assumption also allows for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 80% 60% of the long cohort for males females respectively and an annual 1% underpin.
The assumptions are that a member who retires next year at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.
For a member who is currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time they are assumed to live on average for a further 24 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 25 years after retirement if they are female.
