Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end, including the related gains and losses arising from changes in foreign exchange rates, are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
UK dividends are included net of tax credits.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities, together with any premiums or discounts on purchase, are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Underwriting commission is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
Underwriting commission is recognised in revenue where it relates to shares that the Company is not required to take up.
Where the Company is required to take up a proportion of the shares underwritten, the same proportion of commission received is deducted from the cost of the shares taken up, with the balance taken to revenue.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to the revenue column of the income statement with the following exceptions: With effect from 1st February 2010 the Company allocates 70% of the management fee to capital and the remaining 30% to revenue.
It had previously allocated 50% of the management fee to capital and 50% to revenue.
It remains the Boards determination that the capital return should reflect the indirect costs of earning capital returns and it monitors the assumptions that underpin the basis of allocation.
It concluded from its most recent review that a greater proportion of the Companys long term investment returns will come from capital than was previously expected.
The effect of this change is to increase the net revenue return after taxation by 938,000 and to reduce the net capital return by the same amount.
Total net return after taxation is unaffected by the change.
The comparative figures have not been restated.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise brokerage commission and stamp duty.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 41.
JPM Mercantile pp35 51 JPM Mercantile pp35 51 31 03 2011 07:52 Page 36 36 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the Accounts continued e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
With effect from 1st February 2010 the Company allocates 70% of finance costs to capital and the remaining 30% to revenue.
It had previously allocated 50% of finance costs to capital and 50% to revenue.
The effect of this change is to increase the net revenue return after taxation by 2,214,000 and to reduce the net capital return by the same amount.
Breakage costs incurred on the early repayment of loans are charged 100% to capital.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value, with debtors reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debentures in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
g Taxation Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to the capital column of the income statement on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital column.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
h VAT Expenses are disclosed inclusive of the related irrecoverable VAT.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method, based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
i Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is the also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets, liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on cash and deposit balances are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
j Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are paid.
JPM Mercantile pp35 51 JPM Mercantile pp35 51 31 03 2011 07:52 Page 37 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 37 k Repurchases of ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transactions costs is charged to capital reserves and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of a called up share capital and into the capital redemption reserve.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year Overseas withholding tax 18 63 Current tax charge for the year 18 63 b Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2010: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2010: 28%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2011 2010 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 26,787 238,186 264,973 23,766 354,482 378,248 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 28% 2010: 28% 7,500 66,692 74,192 6,655 99,255 105,910 Effect of: Non taxable scrip dividends 16 16 Non taxable UK dividend income 6,960 6,960 6,669 6,669 Non taxable overseas dividend income 1,377 1.377 392 392 Non taxable capital return 69,780 69,780 101,344 101,344 Unrelieved expenses 853 3,088 3,941 406 2,089 2,495 Overseas withholding tax 18 18 63 63 18 18 63 63 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 42,610,000 2010: 40,248,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 27%.
The Finance Act 2010, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1st April 2011, was substantively enacted on 21st July 2010.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% each year, down to 24% by 1st April 2014.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management policy.
The Company has no significant direct exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys classes of financial instruments are as follows: investments in equity shares and other securities, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a sterling loan facility with ING Bank, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and debentures issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises two elements interest rate risk and market price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these two elements of market risk is given in parts i and ii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings when interest rates are re-set.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Companys gearing policy is to limit gearing within the range 90% to 120% where gearing is defined as investments expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
JPM Mercantile pp35 51 JPM Mercantile pp35 51 31 03 2011 07:52 Page 47 The Mercantile Investment Trust plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 47 The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.
Interest rate exposure The two series of debentures issued by the Company both carry fixed rates of interest and were issued as a planned level of gearing.
This debenture stock is carried in the Companys balance sheet at amortised cost rather than fair value.
Hence movement in interest rates will not affect equity but may have an impact on the share price and discount which is not likely to be material.
The Company has no significant holdings of fixed interest rate securities whose fair value would be affected by interest rate movements.
The Company does not normally hold a significantly high level of cash balances and there is an overdraft facility available when required.
The exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below: 2011 2010 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash at bank and short term deposits 89,530 40,225 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year borrowings on the loan facility 15,000 Total exposure 74,530 40,225 Interest receivable on cash balances, or paid on overdrafts, is at a margin below or above LIBOR respectively 2010: same.
During the year, the Company arranged a 45 million one year floating rate loan facility with ING bank, which expires in January 2012.
Interest is payable at a rate of LIBOR as quoted in the market for the loan period plus a margin of 1.45% per annum, plus Mandatory Costs, which are the lenders costs of complying with certain regulatory requirements of the Bank of England.
At 31st January 2011, the Company had drawn down 15 million on this facility at an interest rate of 2.524% per annum.
The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the level of cash balances and drawings on the loan facility have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum net cash balances during the year are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure during the year net cash balances 215,261 149,565 Minimum interest rate exposure during the year net cash balances 6,986 33,036 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2010: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date with all other variables held constant.

ii Market price risk Market price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Market price risk exposure The Companys total exposure to changes in market prices at 31st January comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,347,468 1,155,894 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 15 to 16 This shows that the majority of the investments value is in the UK.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2010: 20% in the fair values of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities, adjusting for changes in the management fee but with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements and to gear the Company as appropriate.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2011 2010 More than More than three three months months but not but not Three more Three more months than More than months than More than or less one year one year Total or less one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 6,990 6,990 Repurchase of the Companys shares awaiting settlement 949 949 Bank loan 15,000 15,000 Other creditors and accruals 4,869 4,869 4,882 4,882 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Debenture stock principal 178,850 178,850 178,850 178,850 Debenture stock interest 5,441 5,441 201,598 212,480 5,441 5,441 212,480 223,362 17,300 20,441 380,448 418,189 11,272 5,441 391,330 408,043 The outflow of cash in connection with the debenture stock could occur earlier if the Company were to repurchase debentures for cancellation or if the Company goes into default and the security is enforced.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum credit rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Companys assets are ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all of the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The following amounts shown in the Balance Sheet, represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.
2011 2010 Balance Maximum Balance Maximum sheet exposure sheet exposure 000 000 000 000 Fixed assets investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,347,562 1,158,236 2,248 Current assets Debtors securities sold awaiting settlement, dividends and interest receivable and other debtors 4,030 4,030 19,647 19,647 Cash and short term deposits 89,530 89,530 40,225 40,225 1,441,122 93,560 1,218,108 62,120 The maximum credit risk exposure of fixed asset investments at 31st January 2010 comprised a holding in an unrated corporate bond.
No debtors are past their due date and none have been provided for.
Cash and short term deposits comprises balances held at banks that have a minimum credit rating of A1 P1 2010: A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either carried in the balance sheet at fair value or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture stock which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of this debenture stock has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield from a similar dated gilt plus a margin based on the 5 year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital comprises the following: 2011 2010 000 000 Debt 175 million 6.125% debenture stock 25th February 2030 173,147 173,051 3.85 million 4.25% perpetual debenture stock 3,850 3,850 Bank loan 15,000 191,997 176,901 Equity Called up share capital 24,759 25,487 Reserves 1,212,507 1,009,889 1,237,266 1,035,376 Total capital 1,429,263 1,212,277 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 90% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments expressed as a percentage of a total net assets.
2011 2010 000 000 Investments at fair value 1,347,562 1,158,236 Net assets 1,237,266 1,035,376 Gearing 108.9% 111.9% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
