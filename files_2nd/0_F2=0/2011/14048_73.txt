Financial risk management continued 26 d Foreign exchange risk continued iv Cash flow hedges At 31 December 2011, the Group held two currency swaps designated as cash flow hedges against the 2003 US Dollar private placement.
Fixed interest cash flows denominated in US Dollars are exchanged for fixed interest cash flows denominated in Sterling.
The profile of these currency swaps held by the Group is as follows: Notional Receivable USD Payable GBP Notional Receivable USD Payable GBP amount interest rate interest rate amount interest rate interest rate 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 Maturity USD m % % USD m % % August 2015 32.0 5.7 5.7 35.0 5.7 5.7 August 2015 18.3 5.7 5.7 20.0 5.7 5.7 The Group also held a number of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges with a notional amount to sell of 213.2m 2010: buy 29.5m.
All currency derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are highly effective and the fair value loss of 35.7m 2010: 1.7m gain has been deferred in equity.
Amounts in the hedging reserve are recycled to the consolidated income statement as the hedged transactions affect the consolidated income statement.
A loss of 0.3m 2010: 0.3m loss has been included in the consolidated income statement and the remaining loss of 35.4m 2010: 2.0m gain is expected to be recognised in the consolidated income statement in future periods.
v Net investments in foreign operations Where possible the Group will raise external funding to match the currency profile of its foreign operations and mitigate translation exposure.
Currency derivatives are used to protect against movements in foreign exchange where match funding is not possible and there exists a liquid and economic market.
At 31 December 2011 there is a net exchange loss on translation of foreign operations of 2.2m 2010: gain 19.0m.
vi Currency sensitivity The Groups currency exposures that result in net currency gains and losses in the income statement and equity arise principally from US Dollar financial instruments.
At 31 December 2011, if the US Dollar had weakened by 10% against Sterling, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.2m lower 2010: 0.1m lower, mainly as a result of movements on working capital.
26 e Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to minimise the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings to provide an appropriate level of certainty to cost of funds.
Exposure to interest rate risk arises principally on changes to US Dollar and Sterling interest rates.
i Interest rate management An analysis of financial assets and liabilities exposed to interest rate risk is set out below: Financial assets Weighted Weighted average fixed average fixed Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 m m % m m % Cash and cash equivalents 254.8 279.3 Financial liabilities Weighted Weighted average fixed average fixed Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 m m % m m % Non recourse Canadian Dollar loans 15.5 5.27 23.7 5.27 Sterling loans 105.4 94.2 5.93 19.2 118.6 5.83 US Dollar loans 191.6 408.6 3.66 106.3 223.5 2.53 Other loans 27.5 22.8 324.5 518.3 148.3 365.8 Exposure to interest rate fluctuations is mitigated through the use of interest rate derivatives.
Excluded from the above analysis is 45.9m 2010: 26.4m of amounts payable under finance leases, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
