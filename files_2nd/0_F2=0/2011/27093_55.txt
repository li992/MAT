23 Financial Instruments As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and makes other investments so as to secure its investment objective of capital growth.
The Company borrows money when the Board and Managers have sufficient conviction that the assets funded by borrowed monies will generate a return in excess of the cost of borrowing.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that cause short term variation in the Companys net assets and could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
These risks are categorised here as market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Board monitors closely the Companys exposures to these risks but does so in order to reduce the likelihood of a permanent reduction in the Companys net assets rather than to minimise the short term volatility.
The risk management policies and procedures outlined in this note have not changed substantially from the previous accounting period.
Market Risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument or other investment held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and the Companys Investment Manager both assesses the exposure to market risk when making individual investment decisions and monitors the overall level of market risk across the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Details of the Companys investment portfolio are shown in note 9.
Details of derivative financial instruments open at the balance sheet date are shown on pages 47 and 48.
Currency Risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and that in which it reports its results.
Consequently, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
The Investment Manager assesses the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
However, the currency in which a companys share price is quoted is not necessarily the one in which it earns its profits.
The movement in exchange rates on overseas earnings may have a more significant impact upon a companys valuation than a simple translation of the currency in which the share price of the company is quoted.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts are used periodically to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Where appropriate, they are used also to achieve the portfolio characteristics that assist the Company in meeting its investment objectives.
THE MONKS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 43 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Exposure to currency risk through asset allocation, which is calculated by reference to the currency in which the asset or liability is quoted, is shown below.
Currency Risk Sensitivity At 30 April 2011, if sterling had strengthened by 5% in relation to all currencies, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by the amounts shown below.
A 5% weakening of sterling against all currencies, with all other variables held constant, would have had an equal but opposite effect on the financial statement amounts.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010.

Interest rate movements may also impact upon the market value of the Companys investments other than its fixed income securities.
The effect of interest rate movements upon the earnings of a company may have a significant impact upon the valuation of that companys equity.
The possible effects on fair value and cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when making investment decisions and when entering borrowing agreements.
The Board reviews on a regular basis the amount of investments in cash and fixed income securities and the income receivable on cash deposits, floating rate notes and other similar investments.
The Company finances part of its activities through borrowings at approved levels.
The amount of such borrowings and the approved levels are monitored and reviewed regularly by the Board.
Movements in interest rates, to the extent that they affect the fair value of the Companys fixed rate borrowings, may also affect the amount by which the Companys share price is at a discount or a premium to the net asset value assuming that the Companys share price is unaffected by movements in interest rates.
During the year the Company drew down a 40 million three year fixed rate bank loan.
The Company also has a 40m one year floating rate bank loan and a 30 year interest rate swap for 40m, the net effect of which is that part of the cost of borrowings over the next thirty years has been locked in but the smaller element that is determined by the additional margin banks charge non-bank customers has only been fixed for a year see notes 11 and 12 and pages 47 and 48 for further details.
The interest rate risk profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 30 April is shown below.

The zero coupon element has a redemption value of 6.25 million fair value 4.0 million and the redemption value of the interest rate swap element fair value 12.6 million is based on a formula linked to thirty year sterling interest swap rates with higher amounts payable as rates rise.
Prior to redemption, the value of the interest rate swap element will vary depending on several factors such as the level of swap rates and the implied volatility of interest rate swap options.
THE MONKS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 45 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Financial Liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Companys bank loans and debentures at amortised cost and the maturity profile of the undiscounted future cash flows in respect of the Companys contractual financial liabilities at 30 April are shown below.

A decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 12,115,000 2010 12,252,000 and would have decreased net asset value per share with borrowings at fair value by 6.6p 2010 6.4p.
Other Price Risk Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
The Board manages the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by ensuring full and timely access to relevant information from the Investment Manager.
The Board meets regularly and at each meeting reviews investment performance, the investment portfolio and the rationale for the current investment positioning to ensure consistency with the Companys objective and investment policy.
Other Price Risk Sensitivity A full list of the Companys investments is shown on pages 12 to 16.
In addition, a geographical analysis of the portfolio, an analysis of the portfolio by broad industrial or commercial sector and a list of the 30 largest equity investments are contained in the Managers Portfolio Review section.
103.0% of the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities 2010 101.8%.
The sensitivity of the Companys equity investments to general movements in equity markets has been adjusted by the use of the equity derivatives instruments detailed on pages 47 and 48, with the sales of equity index futures reducing sensitivity to market movements and the purchase of equity index call options increasing it.
Further details of the impact of these instruments on the portfolio are set out in the Investment Activity section of the Chairmans Statement on page 4 and in the Managers Portfolio Review on page 6.
After taking into account the impact of the equity index futures and options open at the balance sheet date, a 5% increase in quoted equity valuations at 30 April 2011 would have increased total assets and total return on ordinary activities by 53,385,000 2010 48,801,000.
A decrease of 5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Liquidity Risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Liquidity risk is not significant as the majority of the Companys assets are investments in quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Board also sets parameters for the degree to which the Companys net assets are invested in quoted equities.
The Company has the power to take out borrowings, which give it access to additional funding when required.
The Companys current borrowing facilities are detailed in notes 11 and 12 and the maturity profile of its borrowings is set out above.
46 ANNUAL REPORT 2011 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23 Financial Instruments continued Credit Risk This is the risk that a failure of a counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the Company suffering a loss.
This risk is managed as follows: where the Investment Manager makes an investment in a bond or other security with credit risk, that credit risk is assessed and then compared to the prospective investment return of the security in question: the Companys listed investments are held on its behalf by Bank of New York Mellon, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed.
The Investment Manager monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports and reporting its findings to the Board: investment transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers whose creditworthiness is reviewed by the Investment Manager.
Transactions are ordinarily done on a delivery versus payment basis whereby the Companys custodian bank ensures that the counterparty to any transaction entered into by the Company has delivered on its obligations before any transfer of cash or securities away from the Company is completed: the creditworthiness of the counterparty to transactions involving derivatives, structured notes and other arrangements, wherein the creditworthiness of the entity acting as broker or counterparty to the transaction is likely to be of sustained interest, are subject to rigorous assessment by the Investment Manager: and cash is only held at banks that have been identified by the Managers as reputable and of high credit quality.
