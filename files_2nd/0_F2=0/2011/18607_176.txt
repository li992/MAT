Interest rate swaps are all classified as either current assets or current liabilities.

Expiring: In accordance with IAS 39, the group has reviewed its interest rate hedges.
In the absence of hedge accounting, movements in fair value Within one year 171.2 5.0 are taken directly to the income statement.

The approach the group takes to each of these risks is set out below.
The group m m is not significantly exposed to equity price risk or to commodity price risk.
Fixed rate loan facilities 80.8 94.7 Fair values IFRS 7 sets out a three-tier hierarchy for financial assets and liabilities value at fair value.
These are as follows: Book value at Fair value at 30 September 30 September Level 1 quoted prices in active markets for identified assets and liabilities 2010 2010 m m Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly as prices or indirectly Fixed rate loan facilities 83.8 96.5 as derived from prices: and Level 3 inputs for assets and liabilities that are not based on observable market data.
Interest rate risk The groups interest rate risk arises from the risk of fluctuations in interest charges on floating rate borrowings.
The group mitigates The fair value of swaps and other financial instruments is derived from the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates obtained this risk through the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
This subjects the group to fair value risk as the value by means of the current yield curve appropriate for those instruments.
As all significant inputs required to value the swaps are observable, of the financial derivatives fluctuates in line with variations in interest rates.
However, the group seeks to cash flow hedge account where they all fall within level 2. applicable.
The group is, however, driven by commercial considerations when hedging its interest rate risk and is not driven by the strict The CHARM portfolio falls within level 3, inputs not based on observable market data.
Note 21 provides a reconciliation of movements requirements of the hedge accounting rules under IAS 39 if this is to the detriment of achieving the best commercial arrangement.
and amounts recognised in the income statement and other comprehensive income.
The basis of valuation and the sensitivity to changes Hedging activities are carried out under the terms of the groups hedging policies and are regularly reviewed by the board to ensure in the key valuation assumptions are documented in note 2, Critical accounting estimates and assumptions.
The board reviews its policy on interest rate exposure regularly with a view to establishing that it is still relevant in the prevailing and forecast economic environment.
The current group treasury policy is to maintain floating rate exposure of no greater than 35% of expected borrowing.
As at 30 September 2011, 73% 2010: 75% of the groups net borrowings were economically hedged to fixed or capped rates.
