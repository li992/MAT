We also aim to use 3is global network to support our portfolio companies continued international development.
The second priority is to continue to use our brand, deep local market presence and sector insights to originate and invest in attractive new investment opportunities.
More favourable M&A markets and general macroeconomic conditions have the potential to provide a further stimulus to our market activity.
In part, these priorities will be achieved through the benefits of a more integrated Private Equity business, which can draw on a wider range of resources, knowledge and relationships.
