The Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business in Japan is now shown as a separate segment.
Comparative information has been restated on a consistent basis.
GSKs operating segments are being reported based on the financial information provided to the Chief Executive officer and the responsibilities of the Corporate Executive Team CET.
Individual members of the CET are responsible for each geographic segment of the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines business, ViiV Healthcare and the Consumer Healthcare business as a whole, respectively.
R&D investment is essential for the sustainability of the pharmaceutical businesses.
However, for segment reporting, the USA, Europe, Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic and Japan Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines operating profits exclude allocations of globally funded R&D as well as central costs, principally corporate functions and unallocated manufacturing costs.
GSKs management reporting process allocates intra-Group profit on a product sale to the market in which that sale is recorded, and the profit analyses below have been presented on that basis.
Other trading and unallocated pharmaceuticals and vaccines includes Canada, Puerto Rico, central vaccine tender sales and contract manufacturing sales, together with costs such as vaccines R&D, central dermatology costs and central manufacturing costs not attributed to other segments.
The Pharmaceuticals R&D segment is the responsibility of the Chairman, Research & Development and is reported as a separate segment.
Corporate and other unallocated costs and disposal profits include corporate functions, costs for legal matters, fair value movements on financial instruments and investments and profits on global asset disposals.

7 Major restructuring programme In October 2007, the Board approved the implementation of a detailed formal plan for, and GSK announced, a significant new Operational Excellence restructuring programme to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its operations.
A second formal plan, representing a significant expansion of the Operational Excellence programme was approved by the Board and announced in February 2009.
A further expansion was approved by the Board and announced in February 2010.
This restructuring programme, comprising these detailed formal plans, covers all areas of GSKs business, including manufacturing, selling, R&D and infrastructure.
Further savings have been identied during the year and with an estimated total cost increased to approximately 4.85 billion, the expanded programme is now expected to deliver annual pre-tax savings of approximately 2.8 billion by the time it is substantially complete in 2014.
Approximately 82% of the programme costs were incurred by 31 December 2011 and approximately 13% are expected to be incurred in 2012, with the majority of the balance being incurred in 2013.
In total approximately 75% of these costs are expected to be cash expenditures and 25% expected to be asset write-downs.
Uncertainties exist over the exact amount and timing of cash outows as a result of potential future exchange rate uctuations and as many elements of the restructuring programme are subject to employee consultation procedures, making it difficult to predict with precision when these procedures will be completed.
However, the majority of the remaining cash payments are expected to be made in 2012 and 2013.
Of the total restructuring costs of 590 million incurred in 2011, 530 million was incurred under the Operational Excellence programme in the following areas: s COST SAVING PROJECTS IN 2 $ FOCUSED PRIMARILY ON THE SIMPLIlCATION AND STREAMLINING OF SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING SOME SITE rationalisations, principally the Clinical Imaging Centre, Hammersmith and Harlow in the UK and Verona in Italy: s THE ADOPTION OF MORE CUSTOMISED SALES APPROACHES LEADING TO STAFF REDUCTIONS IN A NUMBER OF SALES FORCES PRINCIPALLY IN TALY s THE CLOSURE OF A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURING SITES PRINCIPALLY IN THE 53!
AND RELAND GIVING RISE TO ASSET WRITE DOWNS AND STAFF reductions: s THE RATIONALISATION OF THE #ONSUMER EALTHCARE BUSINESS AND s PROJECTS TO SIMPLIFY OR ELIMINATE PROCESSES LEADING TO STAFF REDUCTIONS IN ADMINISTRATIVE AND SUPPORT FUNCTIONS The remaining costs of 60 million were incurred during the year under the restructuring programme related to the integration of the Stiefel Laboratories, Inc. business in the USA, following its acquisition in July 2009.

The higher tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2010 reects the impact of the relatively low tax relief arising on the 4 billion of legal provisions charged during the year and the non-deductability of costs associated with certain site closures, partly offset by the settlement of certain historical tax matters.
The percentages within the above reconciliation are exacerbated by the relatively low reported profit in 2010.
The Group operates in countries where the tax rate differs from the UK tax rate.
The impact of these overseas taxes on the overall rate of tax is shown above.
profits arising from certain operations in Singapore are accorded special status and are taxed at reduced rates compared with the normal rates of tax in that territory.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 2.1p in 2011, 1.6p in 2010 and 2.8p in 2009.
The Group is required under IFRS to create a deferred tax asset in respect of unrealised inter-company profit arising on inventory held by the Group at the year-end by applying the tax rate of the country in which the inventory is held rather than the tax rate of the country where the profit was originally made and the tax paid, which is the practice under UK and US GAAP.
As a result of this difference in accounting treatment the Group tax rate on current period inter-company profit under IFRS decreased by 0.7% in 2011 2010 1.7% increase: 2009 0.5% increase arising from changes in the location of work-in-progress and nished goods.

GSK Annual Report 2011 159 Overview 02 Strategic review 10 Financial review & risk 51 Governance & remuneration 78 Financial statements 134 Shareholder information 222 14 Taxation continued Issues relating to taxation The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations involves significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets.
This gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GSK.
During the year GSK agreed and settled further open years with major tax authorities up to and including 2009.
In January 2012, the Supreme Court of Canada heard an appeal by GSK and the Canadian Revenue Agency against a Federal Court of Appeal judgement in respect of GSKs transfer pricing in the early 1990s and judgement is awaited.
GSK continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from periods which are open and not yet agreed by tax authorities.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of agreements with relevant tax authorities or litigation where appropriate.
Provision for deferred tax liabilities of 84 million have been made in respect of taxation that would arise on the distribution of profits retained by certain overseas subsidiaries.
No further provision is made, on the grounds that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of remaining temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the forseeable future.
The aggregate amount of these unremitted profits at the balance sheet date was approximately 28 billion 2010 30 billion.
The unprovided deferred tax on unremitted earnings at 31 December 2011 is estimated to be 500 million 2010 500 million, which relates to taxes payable on repatriation and dividend withholding taxes levied by overseas tax jurisdictions.
UK legislation relating to company distributions provides for exemption from tax for most repatriated profits, subject to certain exceptions.

All other deferred tax movements arise from the origination and reversal of temporary differences.
Other net temporary differences mainly include accrued expenses for which a tax deduction is only available on a paid basis.

Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise losses.
Factors affecting the tax charge in future years As a global organisation there are many factors which could affect the future effective tax rate of the Group.
The mix of profits across different territories, transfer pricing and other disputes with tax authorities and the location of research and development activity can all have a significant impact on the Groups effective tax rate.
Changes to tax legislation in territories where GSK has business operations could also impact the Groups effective tax rate.
The UK Government has proposed some significant changes to the UK taxation system.
In March 2011 the UK Government announced a phased reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 23% over 4 years from April 2011.
The deferred tax movements reect the reduction in the UK tax rate from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011, and to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012, as these have been substantively enacted.
In December 2011 the UK Government published draft legislation to introduce a patent box regime which, if enacted, will apply a reduced rate of corporation tax to income from patents with effect from April 2013.
The UK Government also continues to consult with business on draft legislation relating to controlled foreign companies, which is expected to affect GSK from 1 January 2013.

The trustees have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held by the ESOP Trusts.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using results before major restructuring earnings.
The calculation of results before major restructuring is described in Note 1 Presentation of the financial statements.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated after adjusting the weighted average number of shares used in the basic calculation to assume the conversion of all potentially dilutive shares.
A potentially dilutive share forms part of the employee share schemes where its exercise price is below the average market price of GSK shares during the period and any performance conditions attaching to the scheme have been met at the balance sheet date.

Under IFRS interim dividends are only recognised in the financial statements when paid and not when declared.
GSK normally pays a dividend two quarters after the quarter to which it relates and one quarter after it is declared.
The 2011 financial statements recognise those dividends paid in 2011, namely the third and fourth interim dividends for 2010 and the first and second interim dividends for 2011.

Included in land and buildings at 31 December 2011 are leased assets with a cost of 559 million 2010 582 million, accumulated depreciation of 303 million 2010 280 million, impairment of 19 million 2010 nil and a net book value of 237 million 2010 302 million.
Included in plant, equipment and vehicles at 31 December 2011 are leased assets with a cost of 81 million 2010 95 million, accumulated depreciation of 64 million 2010 54 million, impairment of 14 million 2010 nil and a net book value of 3 million 2010 41 million.
Some lease agreements include renewal or purchase options or escalation clauses.
The impairment losses principally arise from decisions to rationalise facilities and are calculated based on either fair value less costs to sell or value in use.
The value in use calculations determine the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ows of the relevant asset or cash generating unit, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for relevant specic risks.
Where an impairment is indicated and a pre-tax cash ow calculation is expected to give a materially different result, the test would be reperformed using pre-tax cash ows and a pre-tax discount rate.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of approximately 10%.
The impairment losses have been charged to cost of sales 31 million 2010 142 million, R&D 89 million 2010 46 million and SG&A 70 million 2010 17 million, and include 131 million 2010 57 million arising from the major restructuring programmes.
Reversals of impairment arise from subsequent reviews of the impaired assets where the conditions which gave rise to the original impairments are deemed no longer to apply.
All of the reversals have been credited to cost of sales.

The goodwill arising on the acquisitions of ID Biomedical, Sirtris Pharmaceuticals and Domantis has been split between the US, Europe, Emerging Markets, Asia Pacic, Japan and Other Pharmaceutical and Vaccines cash generating units for impairment testing purposes as either the benefit of the acquired businesses is split among the cash generating units or the acquired businesses do not generate independent cash ows.
164 GSK Annual Report 2011 Financial Notes to the financial statements continued statements 18 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are assessed on a fair value less costs to sell basis using the Groups acquisition valuation model.
Fair value less costs to sell of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill is allocated is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted post-tax cash ows plus a terminal value.
A post-tax discount rate is applied to calculate the net present value of the cash ows.
The discount rate used is based on the Group WACC of 7%, as most cash generating units have integrated operations across large parts of the Group.
The discount rate is adjusted where appropriate for specic country or currency risks.
Details relating to the discounted cash ow models used in the impairment tests of the Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines and Consumer Healthcare cash generating units are as follows: Valuation basis Fair value less costs to sell Key assumptions Sales growth rates Advertising and promotion investment Profit margins Terminal growth rate Discount rate Determination of assumptions Growth rates are internal forecasts based on both internal and external market information.
Margins reflect past experience, adjusted for expected changes.
Advertising and promotion investment based on historical levels adjusted for managements view of support needed for innovation and expansion.

7% The terminal growth rates do not exceed the long-term projected growth rates for the relevant markets.
The terminal growth rates used in the fair value less costs to sell calculations for the cash generating units reect the impact of future generic competition and take account of new product launches.
The Pharmaceutical and Vaccines cash generating units comprise a collection of smaller cash generating units including assets with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 679 million 2010 708 million.
The Consumer Healthcare cash generating unit also comprises a collection of smaller cash generating units including brands with indefinite lives with a carrying value of 1.57 billion 2010 1.83 billion.
Details of indefinite life brands are given in Note 19 Other intangible assets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.

The brands are in relatively similar stable and profitable market sectors, with similar risk proles, and their size, diversication and market shares mean that the risk of market-related factors causing a reduction in the lives of the brands is considered to be relatively low.
The Group is not aware of any material legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factor which could limit their useful lives.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
Each brand is tested annually for impairment applying a fair value less costs to sell methodology, generally using five year post-tax cash ow forecasts with a terminal value calculation and a discount rate equal to the Group post-tax WACC of 7%, adjusted where appropriate for country and currency specic risks.
The main assumptions include future sales price and volume growth, product contribution and the future expenditure required to maintain the products marketability and registration in the relevant jurisdictions.
These assumptions are based on past experience and are reviewed as part of managements budgeting and strategic planning cycle for changes in market conditions and sales erosion through competition.
The terminal growth rates applied of between nil and 3% are managements estimates of future long-term average growth rates of the relevant markets.
In each case the valuations indicate sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions is unlikely to result in an impairment of these brands.

At 31 December 2011, the Group owned 81.7 million shares or 19% of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited.
Aspen, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, is Africas largest pharmaceutical manufacturer and a major supplier of branded and generic pharmaceutical, healthcare and nutritional products to the southern African and selected international markets.
The investment had a book value at 31 December 2011 of 393 million 2010 397 million and a market value of 627 million 2010 729 million.
Although the Group holds less than 20% of the ownership interest and voting control of Aspen, the Group has the ability to exercise significant inuence through both its shareholding and its nominated directors active participation on the Aspen Board of Directors.
On 1 February 2011 GSK disposed of its entire 18% shareholding in Quest Diagnostics Inc. a US clinical laboratory business listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
The sale comprised a secondary public offering and an accompanying repurchase of shares by Quest Diagnostics which together generated a profit on disposal of 584 million before tax.
The transfer from other investments in 2011 relates to the Groups holding in Longwood Founders Fund, L. P, previously classied within other investments.
Summarised balance sheet information in respect of the Groups associates is set out below: 2011 2010 m m Total assets: Quest Diagnostics Inc. 5,466 Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 2,165 1,913 Others 356 360 2,521 7,739 Total liabilities: Quest Diagnostics Inc. 2,868 Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited 988 786 Others 84 73 1,072 3,727 Net assets 1,449 4,012 The summarised balance sheet information in respect of Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Limited is based on preliminary results information and analysts forecasts available at 31 December 2011.
Investments in joint ventures comprise 49 million share of gross assets 2010 66 million and 20 million share of gross liabilities 2010 12 million.
These principally arise from 50% interests in two joint ventures, Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare Holdings, L. P. which is developing specified chemical compounds, and ViiV Healthcare Shire Canada, which primarily co-markets Combivir, Trizivir and Epivir in certain territories, both of which are now part of the ViiV Healthcare business.
Investments in joint ventures also include a 27% interest in Pharmaceutical Insurance Limited, which is a mutual insurance company covering pharmaceutical business risk.
During 2011, GSK made additional capital contributions of 32 million to Shionogi-ViiV Healthcare Holdings, L. P. 2010 24 million.

For investments traded in an active market, the fair value is determined by reference to the relevant stock exchange quoted bid price.
For other investments, the fair value is estimated by management with reference to relevant available information, including the current market value of similar instruments and discounted cash ows of the underlying net assets.
The Group holds a number of equity investments in entities where the Group has entered into research collaborations.
Other investments include listed investments of 385 million 2010 491 million, the decrease primarily arising from fair value adjustments and impairments.
On disposal of investments, fair value movements are reclassied from equity to the income statement based on average cost for shares acquired at different times.
The impairment losses recorded in the tables above have been recognised in the income statement for the year within other operating income, together with amounts reclassied from the fair value reserve on recognition of the impairments.
These impairments initially result from prolonged or significant declines in the fair value of the equity investments below acquisition cost, subsequent to which any further declines in fair value are immediately taken to the income statement.

They are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The increase in assets held for sale primarily arises from the transfer of certain non-core Consumer Healthcare OTC products which the Group is divesting.
No impairment in carrying value was recognised on the transfer.
The divestment is designed to realise value for shareholders and simplify GSKs Consumer Healthcare business and allow it to focus on its priority brands and markets.
The disposal of the North American OTC brands was completed on 31 January 2012, for proceeds of 426 million.
The net profit on disposal is estimated to be approximately 145 million after tax with net cash proceeds expected to be 242 million.
The process of divesting the remaining non-core OTC brands is continuing.

Accruals are made at the time of sale but the actual amounts paid are based on claims made some time after the initial recognition of the sale.
As the amounts are estimated they may not fully reect the final outcome and are subject to change dependent upon, amongst other things, the types of buying group and product sales mix.
The level of accrual is reviewed and adjusted quarterly in the light of historical experience of actual rebates, discounts or allowances given and returns made and any changes in arrangements.
Future events could cause the assumptions on which the accruals are based to change, which could affect the future results of the Group.
Trade and other payables include 16 million 2010 26 million due to associates and joint ventures.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee: or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some hybrid dened benefit schemes also include dened contribution sections.
GSK Annual Report 2011 171 Overview 02 Strategic review 10 Financial review & risk 51 Governance & remuneration 78 Financial statements 134 Shareholder information 222 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets continued Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been calculated using the projected unit method.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
Actuarial movements in the year are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Discount rates are derived from AA rated corporate bond yields except in countries where there is no deep market in corporate bonds where government bond yields are used.
Discount rates are selected to reect the term of the expected benefit payments.
The expected rate of return on bonds reects the portfolio mix of index-linked, government and corporate bonds.
The expected rate of return on equities represents the Groups long term view and includes a higher risk premium over bonds than in the past reecting current low bond yields.
Projected ination rate and pension increases are long-term predictions based on the yield gap between long-term index-linked and xed interest Gilts.
In the UK, mortality rates are determined by adjusting the PCA00 standard mortality tables to reect recent scheme experience.
These rates are then projected to reect improvements in life expectancy in line with the medium cohort i. e. improvements at recently observed higher levels which are assumed to continue to 2020 with minimum improvements thereafter of 1% per year for both males and females.
In the USA, mortality rates are calculated using the RP2000 fully generational table, projected using scale AA, with the white collar adjustment.
The average life expectancy assumed now for an individual at the age of 60 and projected to apply in 2031 for an individual then at the age of 60 is as follows: UK USA Male Female Male Female Years Years Years Years Current 27.5 29.0 24.7 26.3 Projected for 2031 29.8 30.9 26.6 27.4 The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts, either as specic assets or as a proportion of a general fund, or are insurance contracts.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
The Group reviewed the investment strategy of the UK plans in 2011 and it is anticipated that the asset allocation for the UK plans will be adjusted to approximately 55% return seeking assets and 45% liability matching assets.
The target asset allocation of the US plans is currently 50% return seeking assets and 50% liability matching assets.
In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit schemes were merged during 2001.
In addition, the Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.

During 2011, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK pension schemes totalling 368 million 2010 365 million: 2009 332 million and 82 million 2010 91 million: 2009 95 million to the US scheme.
In 2009, GSK reached an agreement with the trustees of the UK pension schemes to make additional contributions to eliminate the pension deficit identied at the 31 December 2008 actuarial funding valuation.
The additional contributions are expected to be 365 million per year for 2012 to 2013.
The contributions are based on a discount rate of 5.25% and an ination assumption of 2.8%.
The next review of contribution levels is in progress and will be based on the actuarial valuation at 31 December 2011.
Employer contributions for 2012, including special funding contributions, are estimated to be approximately 750 million in respect of dened benefit pension schemes and 70 million in respect of post-retirement benets.

The liability for the US post-retirement healthcare scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical ination of 7.5% 2010 8%, grading down to 4.75% in 2018 and thereafter.
During 2009, both the US pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes were amended.
The changes resulted in a one-off gain of 37 million recognised in the income statement.
At 31 December 2011 the US post-retirement healthcare scheme obligation was 1,446 million 2010 1,288 million: 2009 1,102 million.
However, in accordance with IAS 19 the unvested part of a benefit improvement is not recognised immediately on the balance sheet but is recognised gradually through the income statement.
At 31 December 2011, for the Group, the unrecognised past service cost of 21 million 2010 34 million: 2009 40 million primarily relates to the effect of the change in the US post-retirement healthcare scheme, which amounted to 31 million 2010 36 million: 2009 42 million.
The dened benefit pension obligation is analysed as follows: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Funded 13,956 13,033 12,126 Unfunded 378 346 312 14,334 13,379 12,438 Post-retirement benets are unfunded.

Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to product liability principally relating to Avandia, Paxil and Poligrip, anti-trust principally relating to Wellbutrin and Flonase, government investigations principally relating to the Colorado investigation, Avandia-related investigations, AWP and nominal price investigations and the Cidra, Puerto Rico manufacturing settlement, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The charge for the year of 357 million 157 million net of reversals and estimated insurance recoveries primarily relates to provisions in relation to product liability cases regarding Paxil, Poligrip and other products and various government investigations.
The discount on the provisions decreased by 12 million in 2011 2010 2 million and was calculated using risk-adjusted projected cash ows and risk-free rates of return.
The movement in 2011 includes a decrease of 5 million 2010 10 million arising from a change in the discount rate in the year.
In respect of product liability claims related to certain products, there is sufficient history of claims made and settlements to enable management to make a reliable estimate of the provision required to cover unasserted claims.
In certain cases an IBNR incurred but not reported actuarial technique is used to determine this estimate.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters, including those provided using the IBNR actuarial technique, may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over many years.
Litigation proceedings, including the various appeal procedures, often take many years to reach resolution, and out-of-court settlement discussions can also often be protracted.
The Group is in potential settlement discussions in a number of the disputes for which amounts have been provided and, based on its current assessment of the progress of these disputes, estimates that 2.7 billion of the amount provided at 31 December 2011 will be settled within one year.
At 31 December 2011, it was expected that 29 million 2010 117 million of the provision made for legal and other disputes will be reimbursed by third party insurers.
This amount is included within the Other receivables balances in Note 22, Other non-current assets and Note 24, Trade and other receivables.
For a discussion of legal issues, see Note 44 Legal proceedings.
Major restructuring programmes In October 2007 the Group announced a significant new Operational Excellence programme to improve the effectiveness and productivity of its operations see Note 7 Major restructuring programme.
A significant expansion of the Operational Excellence programme was approved by the Board and announced in February 2009.
Provisions for staff severance payments are made when management has made a formal decision to eliminate certain positions and this has been communicated to the groups of employees affected.
No provision is made for staff severance payments that are made immediately.
Pension augmentations arising from staff redundancies of 5 million 2010 110 million have been charged during the year and then transferred to the pension obligations provision as shown in Note 28 Pensions and other post-employment benets.
Asset writedowns have been recognised as impairments of property, plant and equipment in Note 17 Property, plant and equipment.
The majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised in the next two years.
Employee related provisions Employee related provisions include certain medical benets to disabled employees and their spouses in the USA.
At 31 December 2011, the provision for these benets amounted to 121 million 2010 120 million.
Other employee benets reect a variety of provisions for severance costs, jubilee awards and other long-service benets.
Integration and manufacturing reorganisation Provisions for integration and manufacturing reorganisations reect costs related to ongoing restructuring programmes not included within the costs disclosed in Note 7, Major restructuring programmes.
Other provisions Included in other provisions is contingent consideration in respect of business acquisitions, principally of Stiefel Laboratories Inc. in 2009.
The contingent consideration is payable upon certain criteria being met by certain specified dates in the future.
The aggregate provision for these items amounts to 42 million at 31 December 2011 2010 164 million.

At 31 December 2011, 1 million 2010 4 million of financial assets were pledged as collateral for contingent liabilities.
Provision is made for the outcome of tax, legal and other disputes where it is both probable that the Group will suffer an outow of funds and it is possible to make a reliable estimate of that outow.
At 31 December 2011, other than for those disputes where provision has been made, it was not possible to make a reliable estimate of the potential outow of funds that might be required to settle disputes where the possibility of there being an outow was more than remote.
Descriptions of the significant tax, legal and other disputes to which the Group is a party are set out in Note 14, Taxation and Note 44, Legal proceedings.

Stiefels products will benefit from GSKs global distribution and commercial organisations, particularly in markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, China and Japan.
GSKs products will benefit from Stiefels speciality sales force relationships and experienced management in dermatology.

A number of commitments were made in 2011 under licensing and other agreements, including arrangements with Theravance, Inc. and Janssen Biologics Ireland.
These new arrangements were offset by reduced commitments due on prior year transactions including amendments to the agreements with Anacor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Concert Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Chroma Therapeutics, Inc. OncoMed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Tolerx, Inc. and also to MPEX Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which was terminated during the year.
The table above shows this commitment, but excludes the normal ongoing annual funding requirement of approximately 120 million.

The exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching local currency income with local currency costs.
For this purpose, our internal trading transactions are matched centrally and we manage inter-company payment terms to reduce foreign currency risk.
Exceptional foreign currency cash ows can be hedged selectively under the management of Corporate Treasury and the TMG.
Where possible, we manage the cash surpluses or borrowing requirements of subsidiary companies centrally using forward contracts to hedge future repayments back into the originating currency.
In order to reduce foreign currency translation exposure, we seek to denominate borrowings in the currencies of our principal assets and cash ows.
These are primarily denominated in US dollars, Euros and Sterling.
Certain borrowings can be swapped into other currencies as required.
Borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies that match investments in overseas Group assets may be treated as a hedge against the relevant assets.
Forward contracts are also used in major currencies to reduce our exposure to our investment in overseas Group assets see Net investment hedges section of this note for further details.
The TMG reviews the ratio of borrowings to assets for major currencies monthly.
Credit risk The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 11,541 million 2010 12,285 million which is the total of the Groups financial assets with the exception of Other investments which do not bear credit risk.
See page 195 for details on the Groups total financial assets.
GSKs greatest concentration of credit risk is 2.0 billion of investments in US Treasury and Treasury repo only money market funds.
These funds are Aaa AAA rated by Moodys and Standard and Poors respectively and bear credit exposure to the US Government Aaa AA rated with Moodys and Standard and Poors respectively.
In 2010, the greatest concentration of credit risk was 1.3 billion with JP Morgan Chase Aa1 AArated at the time with Moodys and Standard and Poors respectively, comprising 1.2 billion invested in deposits and 0.1 billion of derivatives.
Treasury-related credit risk GSK has managed its exposure to credit risk more actively in the recent financial crisis, reducing surplus cash balances in particular in the Middle East, Africa and Europe.
This is part of our Treasury strategy to regionalise our cash management and to concentrate cash centrally as much as possible.
GSK has continued to maintain its conservative approach to counterparty risk throughout this period.
A report on relationship banks and their credit ratings is presented annually to the TMG for approval.
The aggregate credit risk in respect of financial instruments the Group may have with one counterparty is limited by reference to the long-term credit ratings assigned for that counterparty by Moodys and Standard and Poors.
The table below sets out the credit ratings of counterparties for liquid investments, cash and cash equivalents and derivatives.
The gross asset position on each derivative contract is considered for the purpose of this table, although, under the ISDA contracts, the amount at risk is the net position with each counterparty.

Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the amount of net debt, the ratio of xed to oating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December.
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits and derivative financial instruments.
The following analyses are intended to illustrate the sensitivity of such financial instruments to changes in relevant foreign exchange and interest rates.
Foreign exchange sensitivity The tables below show the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar, Euro and Yen financial instruments excluding obligations under finance leases and certain non-derivative financial instruments not in net debt and which do not present a material exposure.
These three currencies are the major foreign currencies in which GSKs financial instruments are denominated.
GSK has considered movements in these currencies over the last three years and has concluded that a 10 cent or 20 yen movement in rates against GBP is a reasonable benchmark.
In the table below, financial instruments are only considered sensitive to foreign exchange rates where they are not in the functional currency of the entity that holds them.
Inter-company loans which are fully hedged to maturity with a currency swap have been excluded from this analysis.

The movements in the income statement relate primarily to hedging instruments for US legal provisions, and to trade payables and trade receivables.
Whilst the hedging instruments provide economic hedges, the related provisions are not financial instruments and therefore are not included in the table above.
The combined sensitivity of these hedging instruments and the provisions would be insignicant if the provisions were included.
The movements in equity relate to foreign exchange positions used to hedge Group assets denominated in Euro.
Therefore, a movement in the value of the currency swap is largely offset by a corresponding opposite movement in the Group asset.
Foreign exchange sensitivity on Group assets other than financial instruments is not included above.

Interest rate sensitivity The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates on its oating rate Sterling, US dollar and Euro financial instruments, being the currencies in which GSK has historically issued debt and held investments.
GSK has considered movements in these interest rates over the last three years and has concluded that a 1% 100 basis points increase is a reasonable benchmark.
Debt with a maturity of less than one year is oating rate for this calculation.
Interest rate movements on derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are deemed to have an immaterial effect on the Group Income Statement due to compensating amounts in the carrying value of debt.
A 1% 100 basis points movement in interest rates is not deemed to have a material effect on equity.
2011 2010 Increase decrease Increase decrease in income in income m m 1% 100 basis points increase in Sterling interest rates 2010: 2% 7 14 1% 100 basis points increase in US dollar interest rates 2010: 2% 12 16 1% 100 basis points increase in Euro interest rates 2010: 2% 15 31 These interest rates could not be decreased by 1% as they are currently less than 1.0%.
The maximum increase decrease in income would therefore be limited to 5 million, 1 million and 14 million for Sterling, US Dollar and Euro interest rates respectively 2010 4 million, 2 million and 9 million.
Contractual cash ows for non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative instruments The following is an analysis of the anticipated contractual cash ows including interest payable for the Groups non-derivative financial liabilities on an undiscounted basis.
The impact of interest rate swaps has been excluded.
For the purpose of this table, debt is dened as all classes of borrowings except for obligations under finance leases.
Interest is calculated based on debt held at 31 December without taking account of future issuance.
Floating rate interest is estimated using the prevailing interest rate at the balance sheet date.
Cash ows in foreign currencies are translated using spot rates at 31 December.

The gross cash ows of foreign exchange contracts are presented for the purposes of this table, though, in practice, the Group uses standard settlement arrangements to reduce its liquidity requirements on these instruments.
The amounts receivable and payable in less than one year have increased compared to 2010 due to higher levels of hedging of intercompany loans, deposits and legal provisions.
This is indicated by the increased principal amounts shown in the table below.

The majority of contracts are for periods of 12 months or less.
At 31 December 2011, the Group held outstanding foreign exchange contracts consisting primarily of currency swaps with a net credit fair value of 128 million 2010 72 million credit which represent hedges of inter-company loans, deposits and legal provisions, but are not designated as accounting hedges.
Changes in fair value are taken to the income statement in the period to offset the exchange gains and losses on the related inter-company lending and borrowing.
Cash ow hedges The Group had no designated cash ow hedges during 2011.
The group carries a balance in reserves that arose from pre-hedging the interest rate exposure of Euro and Sterling bonds issued in 2005 and 2007.
The balance is reclassied to finance costs over the life of these bonds.
GSK Annual Report 2011 201 Overview 02 Strategic review 10 Financial review & risk 51 Governance & remuneration 78 Financial statements 134 Shareholder information 222 41 Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Fair value hedges The Group has designated a series of interest rate swaps as a fair value hedge.
The risk being hedged is the variability of the fair value of the bond arising from interest rate uctuations.
Gains and losses on fair value hedges are disclosed in Note 12, Finance costs.
Net investment hedges During the year, certain foreign exchange contracts were designated as net investment hedges in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its Euro foreign operations.
During 2010, foreign exchange contracts were also designated as net investment hedges of the Groups net investment in its US Dollar and Yen foreign operations.
At 31 December 2011 and at 31 December 2010, the Group held such net investment hedges only in respect of its Euro foreign operations.
In addition, Euro loan capital of 5.85 billion issued in previous years is designated as a net investment hedge in respect of the foreign currency translation risk arising on consolidation of the Groups net investment in its Euro operations.
42 Employee share schemes The Group operates share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at the grant price, savings-related share option schemes and share award schemes.
In addition, GSK operates the Performance Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement by the Group of specified performance targets and the Share Value Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year vesting period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee and from 2010 onwards, no further grants will be made under the savings-related share option schemes.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants of restricted shares and share awards are normally exercisable at the end of the three year vesting performance period.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Grants under share option schemes and awards under the Performance Share Plan are normally granted to employees to acquire shares or ADS in GSK plc but in some circumstances will be settled in cash.
Options under the share option schemes are granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20% below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
Share options awarded to the Directors and, with effect from the 2004 grant, the CET are subject to performance criteria.
Option pricing For the purposes of valuing options and awards to arrive at the share based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
The assumptions used in the model for 2009, 2010 and 2011 are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2ISK FREE INTEREST RATE 0.5% 1.9% 0.8% 1.9% 1.4% 2.9% Dividend yield 5.8% 5.3% 5.2% Volatility 24% 28% 26% 29% 23% 29% Expected lives of options granted under: Share option schemes 5 years 5 years 5 years Savings-related share option and share award schemes 3-4 years 3-4 years 3-4 years Weighted average share price for grants in the year: Shares 11.90 12.04 11.72 ADS $39.10 $37.29 $33.73 0% for those plans where dividends are reinvested.
Volatility is determined based on the three and five year share price history where appropriate.
The fair value of performance share plan grants take into account market conditions.
Expected lives of options were determined based on weighted average historic exercises of options.
There has been no change in the effective exercise price of any outstanding options during the year.

The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a dened measurement period with dividends reinvested during the same period.
For awards granted from 2011 onwards to Directors and members of the CET, the performance conditions are based on four equally weighted measures over a three year performance period.

Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts The Group sponsors Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts to acquire and hold shares in GlaxoSmithKline plc to satisfy awards made under employee incentive plans and options granted under employee share option schemes.
The trustees of the ESOP Trusts purchase shares on the open market with finance provided by the Group by way of loans or contributions.
Costs of running the ESOP Trusts are charged to the income statement.
Shares held by the ESOP Trusts are deducted from other reserves and held at the value of proceeds receivable from employees on exercise.
If there is deemed to be a permanent diminution in value this is reected by a transfer to retained earnings.
The Trusts also acquire and hold shares to meet notional dividends re-invested on deferred awards under the SmithKline Beecham Mid-Term Incentive Plan.
