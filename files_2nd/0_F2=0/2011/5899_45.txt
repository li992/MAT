Post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit post-retirement schemes for qualifying employees in operations around the world.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
The cost of the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The principal scheme is the Fenner Pension Scheme which is based in the UK.
The most recent triennial valuation of the Fenner Pension Scheme, whilst yet to be formally completed, was carried out as at 31 March 2011.
The actuarial valuations for all schemes were updated as at 31 August 2011 by independent qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions used to determine the assets and liabilities of the schemes are as follows: 2011 2010 UK Overseas UK Overseas scheme schemes scheme schemes Discount rate 5.5% 4.3% - 5.
5% 3.9 % 2.0% - 4.5% Rate of increase in benefits in payment subject to Limited Price Indexation increases: - capped at 5.0% 3.0% 2.8% - capped at 2.5% 2.0% 2.2% Expected rate of return on assets of the schemes: - Equity 7.4% 6.0% - 6.
0% 3.4 % 4.1% - 7.0% - Cash 0.5% 0.5% The principal assumptions of the schemes are determined using appropriate expert advice and available market data.
The assumptions of the overseas schemes are given as a range of values in respect of the individual schemes.
The range of values is a consequence of the diversity of territories in which the Group operates defined benefit schemes.
The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date are based on standard actuarial mortality tables, with adjustments to reflect the schemes' actual mortality experience.
For the Fenner Pension Scheme, an increased allowance for future improvement in longevity has also been made.
The assumptions used for the remaining life expectancy are as follows: 2011 2010 UK Overseas UK Overseas scheme schemes scheme schemes Current pensioner at age 65: - men 21 years 17 - 19 years 19 years 17 - 19 years - women 24 years 21 years 23 years 21 years Future pensioner at age 65 current age 45 : - men 23 years 17 - 19 years 20 years 17 - 19 years - women 26 years 21 years 24 years 21 years Fenner PLC Annual Report 2011 75
