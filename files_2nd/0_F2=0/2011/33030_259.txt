The main share-based payment plans that existed during the year are detailed below.
Plans for executive directors For further information on the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP see the Directors remuneration report on pages 139 to 151.
Plans for senior employees The group operates a number of equity-settled share plans under which share units are granted to its senior leaders and certain other employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons.
Grants are settled in cash where the regulatory environment prohibits participants to hold BP shares.
Performance unit plans The number of units granted is related to the level of seniority of employees.
The number of units converted to shares is determined by reference to performance measures over the three-year performance period.
The main performance measure used is BPs total shareholder return TSR compared to the other oil majors.
Plans included in this category are the Competitive Performance Plan CPP, and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.

Share-based payments continued Restricted share unit plans Share unit grants under BPs restricted plans typically take into account the employees performance in either the current or the prior year, track record of delivery, business and leadership skills and potential.
One restricted share unit plan for senior employees, used in special circumstances such as recruitment and retention, normally has no performance conditions.
Plans included in this category are the Executive Performance Plan EPP, the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
BP Share Option Plan BPSOP Share options with an exercise price equivalent to the market price of a BP share immediately preceding the date of grant were granted to participants annually until 2006.
These options are not subject to any performance conditions and are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.
BP Plan 2011 Share options with an exercise price equivalent to the market price of a BP share immediately preceding the date of grant were granted to participants in 2011.
These options are not subject to any performance conditions and will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.
Share Value Plan In 2012, the group will launch a new performance plan known as the Share Value Plan SVP which will grant restricted share units with a three-year performance period.
The number of units granted is dependent on grade and country of operation.
The performance measures are grade specic and include: individual rating, balanced scorecard and TSR criteria.
For the 2012 performance year, no further grants will be made under DAB.
From 1 January 2012, no further grants will be made under CPP, EPP or PSP.
Other plans For further information on BPs savings and matching plans, including the BP ShareMatch plans and the BP ShareSave Plan, see page 158.
