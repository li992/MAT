This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in exchange rates over the course of a period of time.
In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A 10% strengthening of the US dollar against the following currencies at 31 December would have increased equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010: Impact on profit $ million 2011 2010 KZT 3 31 Euro 1 3 UK sterling 3 A 10% weakening of the US dollar against the above currencies at 31 December would have had an equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
d Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to the effect of fluctuations in the price of copper, which is quoted in US dollars on the international markets.
The Group prepares annual budgets and periodic forecasts including sensitivity analyses in respect of various levels of copper prices in the future.
The Group is also exposed, to a lesser degree, to the prices of other metals, including zinc, gold and silver, which are products produced by the Group as by-products to the copper production process.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
A 10% increase decrease in commodity prices would have increased decreased profit after tax by the amounts shown below.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular costs, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010: Impact on profit $ million 2011 2010 Copper 1 Other commodities e Interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates primarily impact borrowings by changing their future cash flows floating rate debt or their fair value fixed rate debt and deposits.
The Groups interest rate management policy is generally to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest.
In some circumstances, an element of fixed rate funding may be considered appropriate.
A limited amount of fixed rate hedging using interest rate swaps may be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant, or in periods when interest rates are perceived to be below long-term historical levels.
The Group had no outstanding interest rate swaps as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010. www.
