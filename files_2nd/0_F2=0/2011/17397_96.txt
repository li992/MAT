Contingent liabilities The Group has given indemnities in respect of performance and contractual related bonds as well as letters of credit issued on its behalf.
The amount outstanding at 31 March 2011 includes 8.3m in respect of Connect Plus M25 letters of credit and 6.6m letters of credit issued as a result of the PBSJ acquisition.
During the year the Group acquired The PBSJ Corporation.
Prior to the acquisition, the Audit Committee of the Board of directors of PBSJ undertook an internal investigation to determine whether any laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act FCPA, had been violated in connection with certain projects undertaken by PBS&J International, Inc. one of PBSJs subsidiary undertakings.
The investigation suggested that FCPA violations may have occurred but did not extend beyond the International operation and that none of PBSJs executive management were involved in criminal conduct.
PBSJ voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Department of Justice and to the SEC and is cooperating fully with their review.
The FCPA provides for penalties, criminal and civil sanctions and other remedies.
Both at the date of acquisition and subsequently at 31 March 2011, management was unable to estimate the potential penalties that may be imposed and therefore no provision had been made at the date of acquisition or at 31 March 2011.
It was not considered possible to determine an accurate estimate of the fees and penalties imposed as they are not formula driven or in any way the result of a predefined calculation.
The Group does not have an estimate of when this will be resolved but it is considered unlikely to be within the next financial year.
