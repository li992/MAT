As at 31 December 2011, the reduction in the rate to 25 per cent on 1 April 2012 has been substantively enacted.
The change in deferred tax has resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of nil which has been recognised in the income statement.
However, the remaining reductions in the rate have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore the proposed changes are not reflected in the figures reported.
The decreases in the rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent would reduce the balance sheet deferred tax asset by approximately nil and would reduce unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately nil.
During the period to 2014, AMEC estimate that the effect of the proposed changes to income and equity would be a charge of nil to the profit and loss account.
