1 On 23 March 2012, the Board announced an amendment to the dividend timetable that had originally been announced on 7 March 2012.
The final dividend payment date of 14 May 2012 remains unchanged and it will be paid to those shareholders on the register on 10 April 2012 instead of 13 April 2012 as announced previously, subject to approval at the AGM on 9 May 2012.
This change has been made in order to prevent the New Ordinary Shares resulting from the proposed conversion of the Existing Incentive Shares as defined in the circular sent to shareholders on 23 March 2012 qualifying for the proposed final dividend payment.
