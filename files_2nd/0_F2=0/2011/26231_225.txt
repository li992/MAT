216 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS EUROPEAN EMBEDDED VALUE BASIS CONTINUED NOTES TO THE SUPPLEMENTARY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 17 SENSITIVITIES In accordance with the guidance issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in October 2005 the table below shows the effect of alternative assumptions on the long term embedded value and new business contribution.

Sensitivity to changes in assumptions may not be linear, and as such, they should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.
A 2% higher risk discount rate would result in a 824m negative impact on embedded value and a 90m negative impact on new business contribution for the year.
