21 Recoverable VAT In 2007 the European Court of Justice ruled that investment management fees should be exempt from VAT.
Since then, HMRC has accepted the Managers repayment claims for the periods from 1990 to 1996 and from 2000 to 2007.
During the year ended 30 April 2009 the Company received a reimbursement of 2,902,000 in this regard together with interest thereon of 1,078,000.
A case has been recently brought against HMRC to seek to recover the amounts relating to the intervening period, 1997 to 2000, together with interest on a compound basis.
The Companys Auditors, PwC, have provided services in connection with this case for a fee of 35,000.
Additional fees may become payable to PwC in the event of a successful outcome to the case.
No amounts have been accrued in this regard.
The potential recoveries of VAT and interest would be a significant multiple to the potential additional fees payable to PwC.
No VAT or related interest recovery has been accrued or recognised as a contingent asset as the outcome of the case is expected to remain uncertain for several years.
