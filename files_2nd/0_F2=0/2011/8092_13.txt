FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2011 1 GENERAL INFORMATION The Company is incorporated in Jersey under the Companies Jersey Law 1991 and headquartered in Switzerland.
The address of the registered office is given on page 40.
The consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2011 and for year then ended comprise those of the Company and its subsidiaries and its interests in jointly controlled entities together referred to as the Group.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Principal Activities and Business Review sections of the Directors Report on page 39.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, for further analysis refer to the Directors Report on page 42 to 43.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling GBP because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in Note 3.
Adoption of new and revised International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs Standards and interpretations adopted in the current period The following new standards, amendments and interpretations have been adopted in the current year: r IAS 24 revised 2009 Related Party Disclosures r IAS 32 amended 2009 Classification of Rights Issues r IAS 39 amended 2009 Recognition and Measurement: Eligible Hedged Items r IFRS 7 amended 2010 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Transfer of Financial Assets r IFRIC 14 amended 2009 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement r Improvements to IFRSs 2010 The adoption of these standards and interpretations has not led to any changes to the Groups accounting policies.
Standards and interpretations in issue, not yet adopted At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but have not yet come into effect: IAS 12 amended 2010 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets not endorsed by the EU IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee Benefits not endorsed by the EU IAS 27 revised 2011 Separate Financial Statements not endorsed by the EU IAS 28 revised 2011 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures not endorsed by the EU IFRS 9 Financial Instruments not endorsed by the EU IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements not endorsed by the EU IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements not endorsed by the EU IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interest in Other Entities not endorsed by the EU IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement not endorsed by the EU Improvements to IFRSs 2011 not endorsed by the EU The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group, except for: r IFRS 9 is a new standard which enhances the ability of investors and other users of financial information to understand the accounting of financial assets and reduces complexity.
IFRS 9 uses a single approach to determine whether a financial asset is measured at amortised cost or fair value, replacing the many different rules in IAS 39.
Other components to the standard such as hedge accounting and balance sheet offsetting, will be issued in 2012.
This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015 and therefore the Group has not commenced its evaluation of the impact on the Groups reported profit or net assets.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 67 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 1 GENERAL INFORMATION continued r IFRS 10 is a new standard which replaces the portion of IAS 27 that addresses the accounting for consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 10 includes a new definition of control, which determines which entities are consolidated.
This standard is effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
The Group has evaluated the impact on its consolidation and concluded that IFRS 10 would currently have no impact.
However for any future acquisitions, the implications of IFRS 10 should be considered.
r IFRS 11 is a new standard which replaces IAS 31 and SIC 13.
Under IFRS 11 joint control is defined as the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement which exists only when the decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
IFRS 11 addresses only two forms of joint arrangements joint operations and joint ventures and removes the option to account for using proportionate consolidation.
Since the current accounting for Joint Ventures is by proportionate consolidation, the Group will consider in 2012 how it can change its system to equity accounting.
This change in policy will require a restatement of the comparative period as well.
r IFRS 13 is a new standard which provides guidance on the determination of fair value and introduces consistent requirements for disclosure on fair value measurements.
IFRS 13 applies to all transactions and balances financial or non-financial for which IFRSs require or permit fair value measurements, with the exception of share-based payment transactions accounted for under IFRS 2 Shared-based Payment and leasing transactions within the scope of IAS 17 Leases.
The Group evaluated the impact on the Groups consolidation and concluded that the only item not covered within our existing IFRS disclosures, that is measured at fair value would be separately identified Intangibles acquired in a material business combination.
68 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc 2 BASIS OF PREPARATION The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulations.
Adjusted results Management believes that adjusted results and adjusted earnings per share Note 15 provide additional useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The term adjusted is not a defined term under IFRS and may not therefore be comparable with similarly titled profit measurements reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to, IFRS measurements of profit.
The following charges credits were presented as adjusting items: 2011 2010 Notes m m Restructuring and reorganisation costs 8 15.2 8.3 Acquisition related costs 7 1.4 1.3 Amortisation of other intangible assets 17 137.9 133.8 Impairment Robbins Gioia 16 17 50.7 Impairment Counsel on Education in Management 19 5.0 Impairment Other 17 3.6 Subsequent re-measurement of contingent consideration 7 2.9 0.8 Profit on disposal of business 19 0.1 fide-designation of hedge accounting 11 1.1 Excess interest on early repayment of syndicated loans 11 1.5 1.1 207.3 151.4 Tax related to adjusting items 13 54.9 41.3 152.4 110.1 The principal adjustments made are in respect of: r restructuring and reorganisation costs the costs incurred by the Group in reorganising and integrating acquired businesses, non-recurring business restructuring and the closure or disposal of businesses: r amortisation of other intangible assets the Group continues to amortise other intangible assets.
The amortisation charge in respect of intangible software assets is included in the adjusted results.
The amortisation charge in respect of all remaining other intangible assets is excluded from the adjusted results as management does not see these charges as integral to underlying trading: r impairment the Group tests for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently when an indicator exists.
The impairment charge in respect of material acquisitions is individually disclosed.
The impairment charge for those other separately identified intangible assets has been linked with subsequent re-measurement of contingent consideration of those acquisitions: r fide-designation of hedge accounting where syndicated loan facilities have been terminated early the fixed interest rate swaps are of a greater value than the remaining borrowings.
As the swap cannot be re-designated, the over hedged element of the swaps has been charged to the income statement as an exceptional interest charge: and r excess interest on early repayment of syndicated loans capitalised facility fees are amortised over the loan periods but where syndicated loan facilities have been terminated early, the unamortised fees are immediately expensed.
This accelerated expense is not viewed as being part of the underlying results and is thus excluded from the adjusted results.
The tax related to adjusting items is the tax effect of the items above and in 2011 it also includes the effect of the reduction in the UK deferred tax rate from 27% to 25%.
Significant exchange rates The following significant exchange rates versus GBP were applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 USD 1.6047 1.5447 1.5439 1.5472 EUR 1.1461 1.1676 1.1934 1.1586 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 69 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 3 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain assets and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted, all of which have been consistently applied, are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the consolidated financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by other members of the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expense are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interest in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity and consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination plus their share of changes in equity since that date.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, and provisions for returns and cancellations.
Subscription income is deferred and recognised over the term of the subscription.
Sponsorship and exhibition income is deferred and recognised when the event is held.
Delegates income represents fees earned and is recognised when the event is held.
Copy sales revenue is recognised on the sale of the directory or publication.
Advertising revenue is recognised on issue of the publication.
Consulting and training revenues are recognised as services are delivered.
Where consultancy services are provided over a period of time, revenue is recognised using the stage of completion method when the outcome of the contract can be measured reliably.
The stage of completion is determined with regard to key milestones in the contract being attained and the percentage of services performed under the contract as a percentage of the total services to be performed.
Interest income Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Business combinations Business combinations from 1 January 2010: The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in adjusting items in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest in the acquiree is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with IAS 39 either in profit or loss or as a change to other comprehensive income.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it should not be remeasured until it is finally settled within equity.
70 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interest over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
If this consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised in profit or loss.
Business combination prior to 1 January 2010: The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2004 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 NonCurrent Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of purchase consideration over the fair value of net identifiable assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition.
It is recognised as an asset at cost, assessed for impairment at least annually and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units, as defined by the Board for internal management purposes, expected to benefit from the combination.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently when there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Where an impairment test is performed a discounted cash flow analysis is carried out based on the cash flows of the cash generating unit compared with the carrying value of that goodwill.
Management estimate the discount rates as the risk affected cost of capital for the particular cash generating units.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
Upon disposal, the attributable carrying value of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
For business combinations, cost is calculated based on the Groups valuation methodologies Note 18.
These assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis, which are as follows: Book lists 20 years Journal titles 20 40 years Database content and intellectual property 4 20 years Large scale events and exhibitions 8 10 years Software which is not integral to a related item of hardware is included in intangible assets.
Capitalised internal-use software costs include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software, and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with, and who devote substantial time to, the project.
Capitalisation of these costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its internal purpose.
These costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives which are deemed to be 3-10 years.
The expected useful lives of intangible assets are reviewed annually.
The Group does not have any intangible assets with indefinite lives excluding goodwill.
Property and equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property and equipment on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Over life of the lease Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 15 years Freehold land is not depreciated The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the net sale proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 71 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 3 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Non-current assets classified as held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventory Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and expenses incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less marketing and distribution costs expected to be incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are disclosed in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period except for differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised directly in equity.
For such non-monetary items, any exchange component of that gain or loss is also recognised directly in equity.
The statements of financial position of foreign subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at the closing rates of exchange.
The results are translated at an average rate, recalculated for each month between that months closing rate and the equivalent for the preceding month.
Foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries at the closing rate are taken directly to the translation reserve.
In addition, foreign exchange differences arising from retranslation of the foreign subsidiaries results from monthly average rate to closing rate are also taken directly to the Groups hedging and translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the financial year in which the operations are disposed of.
The translation movement on matched long-term foreign currency borrowings, qualifying as hedging instruments under IAS 39, are also taken directly to the hedging reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
72 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Statement of Financial Position as a finance lease obligation.
Finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Rental income from sub leasing property space is recognised on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease and is matched with the corresponding payments made under the head lease.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the current tax payable and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax nor accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated for all business combinations in respect of intangible assets and properties.
A deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that the fair value of the assets for accounting purposes exceeds the value of those assets for tax purposes and will form part of the associated goodwill on acquisition.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Consolidated Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Pension costs Certain Group companies operate defined contribution pension schemes for employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the individual companies.
The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable and is charged as an expense when they fall due.
The Group also operates funded defined benefit schemes for employees.
The cost of providing these benefits is determined using the Projected Unit Credit Method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each reporting date.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent the benefits are vested, and otherwise are amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The current service cost and the recognised element of any past service cost are presented within operating profit.
The interest cost arising on the pension liability less the interest return on the scheme assets is presented within finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the Consolidated Income Statement and in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The expected return on scheme assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension scheme.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost and the fair value of any relevant scheme assets.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 73 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 3 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The fair value of the Share Options and Long-Term Incentive Plan is measured using the Binomial or Monte Carlo model of valuation, which are considered to be the most appropriate valuation techniques.
The valuation takes into account factors such as non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
To assign a fair value to share awards granted under the Share Matching Plan where the proportion of the award released is dependent on the level of total shareholder return, the Monte Carlo Simulation methodology is considered the most appropriate.
An expense is recognised to spread the fair value of each award over the vesting period on a straight line basis, after allowing for an estimate of the share awards that will actually vest.
The estimate of vesting is reviewed annually, with any impact on the cumulative charge being recognised immediately.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised in the Groups Statement of Financial Position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale investments.
The classification is determined by management upon initial recognition, and it is based on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Effective interest method The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and of allocating interest income over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts including all fees on points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts through the expected life of the financial asset, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for all debt instruments within the Group.
Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables are measured on initial recognition at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible with a maturity of three months or less to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Cash Flow Statement.
Available-for-sale investments Listed and unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value.
Fair values of listed securities are based on quoted market prices and the unlisted securities are based on cost.
Gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
Where the investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the investments revaluation reserve is included in profit or loss for the period.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each reporting date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been negatively impacted.
For unlisted shares classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include: r significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or r default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or r it is becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation.
For certain categories of financial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could 74 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 28 days 2010: 25 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with increased default risk on receivables.
A specific provision will also be raised for trade receivables when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments more than 90 days overdue are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of a provision account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the provision account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the provision account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the provision account are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Classification as debt or equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs Finance costs of debts are capitalised against the debt value on first drawdown of the debt and are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Trade payables Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Other financial liabilities Other financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liability, or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
Derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The derivative instruments utilised by the Group to hedge these exposures are primarily interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
The Group does not use derivative contracts for speculative purposes.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 75 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 3 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to their fair value at each reporting date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: r hedges of a change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities or firm commitments fair value hedges : or r hedges of a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction cash flow hedge : or r hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation net investment hedge.
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedging transactions.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Fair value hedge: Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profit or loss immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in the fair value of the hedging instrument and the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognised in the line of the Consolidated Income Statement relating to the hedged item.
Cash flow hedge: The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in other comprehensive income.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a financial asset or financial liability, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss in the same line of the Consolidated Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.
Hedges of net investment in foreign operations: Hedges of net investment in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument in relation to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.
Gains and losses on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve are reclassified to profit or loss when the hedged item is disposed of.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedge instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period.
A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months.
Other derivatives are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Further details of derivative financial instruments are disclosed in Note 30.
ESOP Trust shares Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders funds represent the cost of the Companys ordinary shares acquired by the Employee Share Option Plan ESOP trusts in connection with certain of the Groups employee share schemes.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the reporting date, and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to the affected parties.
76 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc 4 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in Note 3, the Directors are required to make judgments, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
In addition to the judgment taken by management in selecting and applying the accounting policies set out above, the Directors have made the following judgments concerning the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable intangible assets In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable intangible assets on a business combination, management are required to make estimates when utilising the Groups valuation methodologies.
These methodologies include the use of discounted cash flows and revenue forecasts.
For significant acquisitions management have considered the advice of third party independent valuers in identifying and calculating the valuation of any intangible assets arising on acquisition.
Asset lives are estimated based on the nature of the intangible asset acquired and range between 3 and 40 years.
Valuation of share-based payments In order to determine the value of share-based payments, management are required to make an estimation of the effects of nontransferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The expected volatility is determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price calculated over one, two and three years back from the date of grant.
The list of inputs used in the Binomial and Monte Carlo Simulation models to calculate the fair values are provided in Note 10.
Valuation of financial instruments at fair value Management have made a number of assumptions with regards to the models used to value financial instruments at their fair value at year end.
Valuation techniques commonly used by market practitioners are applied.
Note 30 details the methods used to value the primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups borrowing requirements and the derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate profile.
For derivative financial instruments, assumptions are made based on quoted market rates adjusted for specific features of the instrument.
Other financial instruments are valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on assumptions supported, where possible, by observable market prices or rates.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets There are a number of assumptions management have considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill and intangible assets, as determining whether goodwill or intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Note 16 details the assumptions that have been applied.
Pension assumptions There are a number of assumptions management have considered on the advice of actuaries which have an impact on the results of the valuation of the pension scheme liabilities at year end.
The most significant assumptions are those relating to the discount rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
Note 36 details the assumptions which have been adopted.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgment in determining the amounts to be recognised.
In particular, judgment is used when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets should be recognised with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income.
Provisions Provisions have been made for onerous leases, dilapidations and restructuring.
These provisions are estimates and the actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events.
Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.
Details of the Groups provisions are set out in Note 27.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been included based on management estimates of the most likely outcome Note 18.
However under IFRS3 2008 subsequent re-measurement of contingent consideration is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.

The only change in the basis of segmentation or in the basis of measurement of segment profit or loss in the period is with regards to the Events and Training segment.
The Groups three identified reportable segments under IFRS 8 are therefore as follows: Academic Information AI This division, which includes the Taylor & Francis publishing business, provides a portfolio of online and print publications, primarily for academic users across the spectrum of Science, Technology, Humanities and Social Sciences.
Professional and Commercial Information PCI This division, which includes Datamonitor, Informa Business Information and Informa Financial Information provides information, across a range of formats and on a global basis, to a variety of sectors including Medical, Pharmaceutical, Financial, Law, Commerce, Commodities, Maritime and Telecoms.
Events and Training The Events and Training business consists of trade shows and exhibitions, large and small conferences and training courses.
From January 2011, the three geographical divisions of Events and Training were reported to the Board of Directors as one segment and therefore will be disclosed as one reportable segment.
Information regarding the Groups reportable segments is disclosed below and has been prepared consistently with the Groups accounting policies.
The comparatives have been updated to reflect the change in reportable segments.

Shareholders who hold more than 100,000 shares and who wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make a DAP election.
All elections remain in force indefinitely unless revoked.
Unless shareholders have made a DAP election, or are deemed to have made a DAP election, dividends will be received directly from the Company, domiciled in Switzerland, and will be taxed accordingly.
88 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc 15 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic The basic earnings per share calculation is based on a profit attributable to equity shareholders of the parent of 75.4m 2010: 98.9m.
This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue less those non-vested shares held by employee share ownership trusts which is 601,047,454 2010: 600,421,797.
Diluted The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the weighted average number of shares includes all potentially dilutive options granted by the reporting date as if those options had been exercised on the first day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 602,928,726 2010: 600,627,044.

The carrying amount of goodwill recorded in the major groups of cash generating units is set out below: 2011 2010 m m AI 420.6 416.3 PCI 693.3 692.3 Events and Training 650.9 645.1 1,764.8 1,753.7 The Group has recorded an impairment charge in relation to the value of goodwill and intangible assets in the Robbins Gioia business.
This business generates the majority of its revenues from US Government contracts, a market that is decreasing in size following a US Government decision to take more of these contracts in-house.
The impairment charge of 43.2m in relation to Goodwill and 7.5m in relation to the Database Content and Intellectual Property intangible assets has been recognised as an adjusting item in the Consolidated Income Statement.
This impairment charge reduces the carrying value of the business to managements assessment of its recoverable amount.
Robbins Gioia is included in the Events and Training segment.
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions in the value in use are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to cash flows during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax discount rates applied are 9.5% for AI and PCI and 10.5% for the Events and Training businesses.
There has been no change to the discount rate since the prior year, which is consistent with the fact that there has been no significant change in the markets in which the Group operates.
90 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc Estimated future cash flows are determined by reference to latest budgets and forecasts for the next five years approved by management, after which a long term perpetuity growth rate is applied.
The most recent financial budgets approved by the Board of Directors have been prepared after considering the current economic environment in each of our markets.
The estimates of future cash flows are consistent with past experience adjusted for managements estimates of future performance.
Short-term average growth rates used for the five year forecasts vary between 2.8% and 25%.
Long-term average growth rates are 2% for AI and PCI and 3% for Events and Training.
The rates do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, the carrying amounts of goodwill for CGUs were tested for impairment and deemed not to be impaired.
The CGUs which had the lowest level of headroom or potential impairment in this analysis related to the Events and Training businesses.
If the economic environment surrounding this sector continues to decline in 2012 and the effect of which erodes the customer base further, there may be the possibility of a future impairment.
Management will conduct regular reviews to monitor this.
Management has undertaken sensitivity analysis taking into consideration the impact on key impairment test assumptions arising from a range of possible future trading and economic scenarios.
The scenarios have been performed separately for each CGU with the sensitivities summarised as follows: r an increase in the pre-tax discount rate by 1%: r a decrease of 1% of AI and PCI and 2% for Events and Training on forecast operating profits over years 2-5: and r a decrease in the terminal growth rate by 1% for all CGUs.
The sensitivity analysis shows that applying all of the above criteria, an impairment of 37.1m would arise for European Conferences a CGU included in Events and Training.
The carrying value of Goodwill and Intangible assets in the European Conferences business was 165.9m as at 31 December 2011.
2 12.6m 2010: 10.7m additions to Intangible software assets represents cash paid.

The following is the analysis of deferred tax balances for Consolidated Statement of Financial Position purposes: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax liability 164.7 189.3 Deferred tax asset 1.2 164.7 188.1 The June 2010 UK Budget Statement included proposals to reduce the rate of corporation tax from 28% to 24% by 1 April 2014.
These proposals were amended in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement to reduce the rate to 23% by 1 April 2014.
A change from 28% to 27% was enacted as at 31 December 2010.
The effect of that reduction was that the deferred tax liability at 31 December 2010 was reduced by approximately 3.8m, profit increased by 4.0m and Consolidated Other Comprehensive Income was decreased by 0.2m.
The Finance Act 2011 amended the enacted change in 2011 from 27% to 26% and a further change to 25% was enacted as at 31 December 2011.
The effect of this further reduction is to reduce the deferred tax liability by 5.7m, increase profit for the year by 6.0m and reduce Consolidated Other Comprehensive Income by 0.3m.
The proposed further reductions to 23%, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 December 2011, would reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately a further 6.0m.
108 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc At 31 December 2011, the Group has unused tax losses of approximately 12.8m 2010: nil available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset of 4.3m 2010: nil has not been recognised due to the unpredictability of future taxable profit streams.
At the reporting date, the aggregate amount of withholding tax on post acquisition undistributed earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 15.1m 2010: 7.4m.
No liability has been recognised because the Group, being in a position to control the timing of the distribution of intra group dividends, has no intention to distribute intra group dividends in the foreseeable future that would trigger withholding tax.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Board has established a Treasury Committee which is responsible for developing and monitoring the Groups financial instrument related risk management policies.
The committee meets and reports regularly to the Board of Directors on its activities.
The Group treasury function provides services to the Groups businesses, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through internal risk reports which analyse exposures by degree and magnitude of risks.
These risks include market risk including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
The Treasury Committee has put in place policies that have been established to identify and analyse financial instrument related risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
These policies provide written principles on funding and investment policies, credit risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is reviewed by the Treasury Committee.
This Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit, who undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2010.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes borrowings Note 29 and cash and cash equivalents Note 24, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital Note 31, reserves and retained earnings.
Cost of capital The Groups Treasury Committee reviews the Groups capital structure on a regular basis and as part of this review, the Committee considers the weighted average cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Gearing ratio The principal financial covenant ratios under these facilities are maximum net debt to EBITDA of 3.5 times and minimum EBITDA interest cover of 4.0 times, tested semi-annually.
At 31 December 2011 both financial covenants were comfortably achieved, with the ratio of net debt using average exchange rates to EBITDA reduced from 2.3 times at 31 December 2010 to 2.1 times at 31 December 2011.

Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 111 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued c Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Groups activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
The Group enters into interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates and by managing the risk of currencies of its borrowings, the Group is able to achieve a level of natural hedge of both the Statement of Financial Position net currency assets and also the currency earnings due to the currency interest payable.
Refer to both interest rate risk and foreign currency risk in Note 30 d and e respectively.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The Board sets the Groups treasury policy to ensure that it has adequate financial resources to develop the Groups businesses and to manage the currency and interest risks to which the Group is exposed.
Group Treasury monitors the distribution of its cash assets, borrowings and facilities so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
The Board and the Treasury Committee provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as policies covering specific areas, such as funding, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and investments of excess liquidity.
Risk is measured in terms of impact, inherent risk and residual risk, and takes account of managements control actions in mitigating against both external and internal risk events.
The risk model consolidates unique risk events and aggregated risk categories at both a business unit level and Group-wide, and the results are presented to the Risk Committee and the Audit Committee for discussion and review, and may drive the allocation of Internal Audit resources to provide assurance on significant risks in its annual plan.
112 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc d Interest rate risk The Group has no significant interest-bearing assets and is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings by the use of interest rate swap contracts and by the use of cross currency swaps.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either protecting the Statement of Financial Position or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Groups policy is to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by using interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges to hedge up to 90% of forecast interest payments over a period of up to five years, based on forecast net debt levels by currency during that period.
This policy provides a level of certainty of future interest costs by swapping floating to fixed interest payments which in turn assists the predictability of achieving interest-based loan covenants.
During the year, the Group entered into floating to floating cross-currency swaps of 60m to manage the interest rate risk on the borrowings.
The cross-currency swaps have also been designated as part of the net investment hedge of the foreign operations of the Group.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
Interest rate swap contracts The Group draws down on its bank borrowing facilities at floating rates of interest.
A portion of those are then swapped to fixed rates in line with the Group Treasury policy in order to manage its cash flow interest rate risk.
Such contracts enable the Group to convert borrowings from floating rates and swap them into fixed rates.
Under interest rate swaps, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals primarily quarterly, the difference between fixed contract rates and floating-rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the future interest rate curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balance at the end of the financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts outstanding as at the reporting date: Cash flow hedges Average contracted Notional principal Fair fixed interest rate amount value Outstanding receive floating, 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 pay fixed contracts % % m m m m Within one year 5.66 4.59 114.8 403.7 5.1 18.9 Within one to two years 5.66 114.6 3.8 114.8 518.3 5.1 22.7 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 113 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued d Interest rate risk continued Interest rate swap contracts At 31 December 2011, the fixed interest rates vary from 5.23% to 6.08% 2010: 3.13% to 6.15%, and the main floating rates are EURIBOR and LIBOR.
Gains or losses deferred in equity on interest rate swap contracts as of 31 December 2011 will be recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss.
The excess of the notional principal amount over group borrowings represents the fide-designated interest rate swaps.

Interest rate sensitivity analysis A high percentage of loans are at fixed interest rates or are designated in hedging relationships, and hence the Groups interest rate sensitivity would only be affected by the exposure to variable rate debt.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year would have decreased or increased by 2.3m 2010: 0.3m.
114 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc e Foreign currency risk The Group is a business with significant net US Dollar USD and net Euro EUR transactions: hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
In the absence of any currency conversion, cash positions in USD and other trading currencies, such as the EUR would develop imbalances by growing GBP debt.
Allied to the Groups policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries functional currencies, primarily EUR and USD.
This policy has the effect of partially protecting the Groups consolidated Statement of Financial Position from movements in those currencies to the extent that the associated net assets are hedged by the net foreign currency borrowings.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Assets Liabilities 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m USD 105.2 116.9 683.2 99.3 EUR 31.6 43.9 136.4 27.4 Other 36.9 24.1 51.2 7.5 173.7 184.9 870.8 134.2 After taking into account the cross currency swaps, foreign currency borrowings amount to 631.5m 2010: 620.1m.
These are used to hedge against net investments in foreign subsidiaries with the remaining monetary assets and liabilities being in the same currency as the functional currency of the operations involved.
Average rate Closing rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 USD 1.6047 1.5447 1.5439 1.5472 EUR 1.1461 1.1676 1.1934 1.1586 Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group receives approximately 47% of its revenues and incurs approximately 39% of its costs in USD or currencies pegged to USD.
The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the USD against the GBP.
Each 1 cent movement in the USD to GBP exchange rate has a circa 3.6m impact on revenue and a circa 1.4m impact on operating profits.
Offsetting this will be movements to USD interest and USD tax liabilities.
This analysis assumes all other variables, including interest rates, remain constant.
The Group receives approximately 12% of its revenues and incurs approximately 10% of its costs in Euros.
The Group is therefore sensitive to movements in the Euro against the GBP.
Each 1 cent movement in the Euro to GBP exchange rate has a circa 1.3m impact on revenue and a circa 0.5m impact on operating profits.
Offsetting this will be movements to Euro interest and Euro tax liabilities.
Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 115 Informa plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED 30 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued f Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are loans and receivables trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts presented in the Statement of Financial Position are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited by dealing only with counterparty banks with high creditratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies such as Standard and Poors, Moodys and Fitch.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongst approved financial institutions.
Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and approved by the Treasury Committee regularly.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
Trade receivables Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas and the Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including default risk of the industry and country in which the customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty or any group of counterparties having similar character-istics.
The Group defines counterparties as having similar characteristics if they are related entities.
Concentration of credit risk did not exceed 5% of gross monetary assets at any time during the year.
The Group establishes a provision that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables and investments when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
The main components of this provision are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss provision is determined by references to past default experience.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit rating system to assess the potential customers credit quality.
All customers have credit limits set by credit managers and are subject to standard terms of payment for each division.
As the events division works on a prepaid basis they are not subject to the same credit controls and they have a low bad debt history.
The Group is exposed to normal credit risk and potential losses are mitigated as the Group does not have significant exposure to any single customer.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables, which are non-interest bearing, approximates their fair value.
116 Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Informa plc Ageing of trade receivables: Gross Provision Gross Provision 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Not past due 91.6 121.0 Past due 0 30 days 86.2 0.8 51.2 0.9 Past due over 31 days 42.2 12.7 31.9 11.8 Books provision see below 10.1 9.4 220.0 23.6 204.1 22.1 Trade receivables that are less than three months past due for payment are generally not considered impaired.
For trade receivables that are more than three months past due for payment, there are debtors with a carrying amount of 3.3m 2010: 0.5m which the Group has not provided for, as there has not been a significant change in the credit quality and the amounts are considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
A provision relating to returns on books of 10.1m 2010: 9.4m has been disclosed separately in the table above.
This provision is based on Managements best estimate of previous seasonal sales and returns trends, and is included as part of the overall provision balance.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the above amounts.
There are no customers who represent more than 10% of the total gross balance of trade receivables in both 2011 and 2010. g Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, though operationally it is managed by Group Treasury.
Group Treasury have built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking and other debt facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in Note 29 is a summary of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and is expected to continue to be in a net borrowing position.
The Groups policy is to fulfill its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates, principally GBP, USD and EUR: thereby providing a natural hedge against projected future surplus USD and EUR cash inflows as well as spreading the Groups interest rate profile across a number of currencies.

There is no amount payable after five years in 2011. h Fair value of financial instruments The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities are determined as follows: r the fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets is determined with reference to quoted market prices: r the fair value of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments is determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments: and r the fair value of derivative instruments is calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, use is made of discounted cash flow analysis using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
The directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the financial statements approximate to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments or because they bear interest at rates approximate to the market.
