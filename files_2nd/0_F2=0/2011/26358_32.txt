This involves bogus stockbrokers, usually based overseas, cold calling people to: either pressure them into buying shares that promise high returns: or offer to buy their shares at an inflated price claiming that there is a secret takeover or merger.
This is followed by a request for an upfront cash bond to commit to the deal.
In reality, the shares or secret information are either worthless or nonexistent and if you receive such a call, we strongly recommend that you seek independent investment advice from an FSA authorised adviser before you take any action.
If you are concerned that you may have been targeted by such a scheme, please contact the FSA Consumer Helpline on 0845 606 1234, www.
