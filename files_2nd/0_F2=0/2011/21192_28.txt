As the direct method of presentation has been adopted for these activities, no further disclosure is required.
In respect of financing activities, the following items pass through the Companys own bank accounts.

316 Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Companys financial statements A Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Fair value as at 1 January 17,623 17,236 Movement in fair value 2,393 387 At 31 December 15,230 17,623 Fair values are estimated using applicable valuation models underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation, and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy described in note 22 to the Group consolidated financial statements.
ii At 31 December 2011, the Company has two wholly owned subsidiaries, both incorporated in the UK.
These are General Accident plc and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, while General Accident plc no longer carries out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2011 are listed on pages 50 and 51.
B Operating expenses i Operating expenses Operating expenses comprise: 2011 2010 m m Staff costs and other employee-related expenditure see below 156 159 Other operating costs 6 42 Net foreign exchange losses gains 22 25 Total 184 176 ii Staff costs Total staff costs were: 2011 2010 m m Wages and salaries 102 109 Social security costs 11 10 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 3 8 Defined contribution schemes 10 5 Profit sharing and incentive plans 11 10 Equity compensation plans see iv below 16 15 Termination benefits 3 2 Total 156 159 iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 47. iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 30.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors Remuneration Report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.

iv Tax reconciliation The tax on the Companys profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate of the home country of the Company as follows: 2011 2010 m m Profit before tax 206 272 Tax calculated at standard UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% 2010: 28% 54 76 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior years 58 1 Non-assessable dividends 283 311 Disallowable expenses 4 5 Unpaid group relief 64 Movement in deferred tax not recognised 78 Other 1 Total tax credited to income statement 25 228 A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted in March 2011 and is effective from 1 April 2011.
A further reduction from 26% to 25% was substantively enacted in July 2011 and will be effective from 1 April 2012.
In addition, the Government announced its intention to further reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 24% from 1 April 2013 and to 23% from 1 April 2014.
There is no impact on the Companys net assets from the reduction in the rate as the Company has no deferred tax assets or liabilities.
v Deferred tax There was no deferred tax recognised in the Company at 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
The Company has unrecognised tax losses of 296 million 2010: nil and other temporary differences of 245 million 2010: 45 million.
The tax losses have no expiry date.

Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 73 million 2010: 73 million.
The fair value of the subordinated debt at 31 December 2011 was 3,814 million 2010: 4,370 million.
The fair value of the 9.5% guaranteed bonds 2016 at 31 December 2011 was 246 million 2010: 248 million.
The fair value of the commercial paper is considered to be the same as its carrying value.
Further details of these borrowings and undrawn committed facilities can be found in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48.
F Contingent liabilities Details of the Companys contingent liabilities are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 51 g. Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 319 Aviva plc Notes to the Companys financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 G Risk management Risk management in the context of the Group is considered in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
The business of the Company is managing its investments in subsidiary and joint venture operations.
Its risks are considered to be the same as those in the operations themselves and full details of the major risks and the Groups approach to managing these are given in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
Such investments are held by the Company at fair value in accordance with accounting policy D. The fair values of the subsidiaries and joint venture are estimated using applicable valuation models, underpinned by the Companys market capitalisation.
This uses the Companys closing share price at year end.
Given that the key input into the valuation model is based on an observable current share price, and therefore sensitive to movements in that price, the valuation process is not sensitive to non-observable market assumptions.
Management believes the resulting estimated fair values recorded in the balance sheet and any changes in fair values recorded in the income statement are reasonable, and are the most appropriate values at the balance sheet date.
Financial assets, other than investments in subsidiaries and the joint venture, largely consist of amounts due from subsidiaries.
As at the balance sheet date, these receivable amounts were neither past due nor impaired.
Financial liabilities owed by the Company as at the balance sheet date are largely in respect of borrowings details of which are provided in note E and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48 and loans owed to subsidiaries.
Loans owed to subsidiaries were within agreed credit terms as at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate risk Loans to and from subsidiaries are at either fixed or floating rates of interest, with the latter being exposed to fluctuations in these rates.
The choice of rates is designed to match the characteristics of financial investments which are also exposed to interest rate fluctuations held in both the Company and the relevant subsidiary, to mitigate as far as possible each companys net exposure.
The majority of the Companys external borrowings are at fixed rates of interest and are therefore not exposed to changes in these rates.
However, for those borrowings that are at floating rates, the Company is affected by changes in these rates.
Further details of the Companys borrowings are provided in note E and the Group consolidated financial statements, note 48.
Currency risk The Companys direct subsidiaries are all incorporated and operating in the UK, and therefore are not exposed to currency risk.
However, these subsidiaries are themselves exposed to foreign currency risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates during the course of providing insurance and asset management services around the world.
The exposure of the subsidiaries to currency risk is considered from a Group perspective in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 56.
The Company faces exposure to foreign currency risk through some of its borrowings which are denominated in euros and US dollars.
However, most of these borrowings have been on-lent to a subsidiary which holds financial investments in these currencies, generating the net investment hedge described in the Group consolidated financial statements, note 57 a iii.
H Related party transactions The Company receives dividend and interest income from subsidiaries and pays interest and fee expense to those subsidiaries in the normal course of business.
These activities are reflected in the table below.
Loans to and from subsidiaries are made on normal arms-length commercial terms.
The maturity analysis of the related party loans is as follows: Loans owed by subsidiaries 2011 2010 Maturity analysis m m Within 1 year 691 1 to 5 years 1,749 1,769 Over 5 years 626 642 Total 2,375 3,102 Loans owed to subsidiaries 2011 2010 Principal Interest Total Principal Interest Total Maturity analysis of contractual undiscounted cash flows m m m m m m Within 1 year 502 365 867 514 424 938 1 to 5 years 364 810 1,174 1,125 362 1,487 Over 5 years 1,742 128 1,870 1,742 180 1,922 Total 2,608 1,303 3,911 3,381 966 4,347 Other related party balances comprise dividends and interest receivable and payable, as well as inter-company balances for fees and other transactions in the normal course of business.
