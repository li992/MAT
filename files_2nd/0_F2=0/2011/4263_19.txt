Contingent consideration 30 December 2011 31 December 2010 $000 $000 Amounts included within non-current liabilities 1,567 The contingent consideration relates to milestone-based contingent consideration payments as part of the acquisition of APT Licensing Limited see note 38.
The amount recorded is the Companys best estimate of the likely outflows that will be required under the terms of the acquisition agreement.
At 30 December 2011, the Company identified that it was not probable that any of the milestones which would trigger the payment of further consideration would be achieved and therefore future outflows were likely to be $nil.
The contingent consideration liability was therefore fide-recognised accordingly, with the movement in fair value of $1.62 million recognised through the profit or loss.
This was confirmed subsequent to the balance sheet date.

52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 30 December 2011 31 December 2010 $000 $000 Financial assets Available for sale 3,610 1,000 Loans and receivables including cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits 91,304 183,421 Fair value through profit and loss FVTPL 5,510 37,978 100,424 222,399 Financial liabilities Amortised cost 112,187 48,607 At the reporting date there are no loans and receivables designated at fair value through profit and loss.
The carrying amount reflected above represents the Companys maximum exposure to credit risk for such loans and receivables.
Financial risk management objectives The Group Treasury function provides services to the Company, co-ordinates access to domestic and international financial markets and monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Company.
The main risks the Company is exposed to are the currency risk component of market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk.
Foreign currency risk management The Company does not seek to manage the currency risk component of market risk as these risks are managed on a Group level.
The Company does not enter into any financial derivative contracts.
The Company does not enter into, or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure of the Company to foreign currency movements for its non-derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
If the US dollar had strengthened by 10 percent against GBP sterling, the Companys: Profit for the 52 week period ended 30 December 2011 would have increased by $9,344,000.
Profit for the 52 week period ended 31 December 2010 would have increased by $6,307,000.
In both periods, this is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to foreign exchange movements on Sterling denominated monetary assets and liabilities: there is no impact on other equity reserves 2010: $nil.
A 10 percent weakening of the US dollar against GBP sterling would have had the equal but opposite effect, on the basis that all the other variables remain constant.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change in currency rates given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2010.
Interest rate risk management The company has no significant direct exposures to fluctuations in interest rates other than those on interest bearing cash balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at fixed rates of interest and the effective rate of interest on those balances in the period was 0.24% 2010: 0.26%.
Credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparties will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company.
For cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits, the Company only transacts with entities that are equivalent to investment grade and above and Group treasury policy dictates that less than 30% of the total balance on cash and equivalents and treasury deposits will be placed on term deposit with counterparties who have a Moodys credit rating of less than Aa2.
Other financial assets consist of amounts receivable from related parties.
The Companys exposure to significant concentration of credit risk on receivables from related parties is detailed in note 48.
Liquidity risk management Ultimate responsibility for the liquidity risk management of the Company rests with the Board of Directors which manages the liquidity requirements of the Company in terms of short, medium and long-term funding requirements.
The Company manages liquidity risk via the Groups Treasury function using sources of financing from other Group entities and investing excess liquidity.
The Company manages excess reserves by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
