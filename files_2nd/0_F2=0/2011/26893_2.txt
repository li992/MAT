The Merchants Trust PLC Investment Policy Investment Objective To provide an above average level of income and income growth together with long term growth of capital through a policy of investing mainly in higher yielding UK FTSE 100 companies.
Benchmark The Companys investment performance is assessed by comparison with other investment trusts within the UK Growth and Income sector.
In addition, it is benchmarked against the FTSE 100 Index, reflecting the emphasis within the portfolio, as well as the FTSE 350 Higher Yield Index, reflecting the Companys higher yield objective.
Gearing The Companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested.
The Company has the facility to gear borrow money with the objective of enhancing future returns.
Historically, gearing has been in the form of long-term, fixed-rate debentures.
The Board monitors the level of gearing and makes decisions on appropriate action based on the advice of the Manager and the future prospects of the Companys portfolio.
The Companys authorised borrowing powers set out in the Articles of Association state that the Companys borrowings may not exceed its called up share capital and reserves.
In normal market conditions, it is unlikely that gearing borrowings as a percentage of net assets will exceed 35%.
Risk Diversification The Company will aim to achieve a spread of investments, with no single investment representing more than 15% of assets.
The Company will seek to diversify its portfolio into at least five market sectors, with no one sector comprising more than 35% of the portfolio.
