158 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 35 BORROWINGS CONTINUED iii Borrowings excluding unit linked borrowings Analysis by maturity continued As at 31 December 2011, the Group had in place a 1.00bn syndicated committed revolving credit facility provided by a number of its key relationship banks, maturing in October 2016.
This facility which was entered into in October 2011 replaces syndicated and bilateral facilities totalling 1.02bn which had been due to expire in December 2012.
No drawings were made under any of these facilities during 2011.
The maturity prole above is calculated on the basis that a facility to renance a maturing loan is not recognised unless the facility and loan are related.
If renancing under the Groups credit facilities was recognised, then all amounts shown as repayable within one year would be reclassied as repayable between one and five years.
Undiscounted interest payments are estimated based on the year end applicable interest rate and spot exchange rates.
Short term assets available at the holding company level exceeded the amount of non-unit linked short term borrowings of254m 2010: 288m.
They comprise Euro Commercial paper and bank loans.
36 PROVISIONS Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outow of resources embodying economic benets will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The Group recognises a provision for onerous contracts when the expected benets to be derived from a contract are less than the unavoidable costs of meeting the obligations under the contract.

The Fund was closed to new members from January 1995: lastfull actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2009.
Legal & General Group UK Senior Pension Scheme the Scheme.
The Scheme was, with a few exceptions principally transfers from the Fund, closed to new members from August 2000 and nally closed to new members from April 2007: last full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2009.

Rgime fide Retraite Prestations Dnies fide Legal & General France : last full actuarial valuation as at 31 December 2011.
The assets of all UK dened benefit schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds which are subject to regular actuarial valuation every three years, updated by formal reviews at reporting dates.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of dened benefit pension schemes is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets.
Plan assets exclude any insurance contracts issued by the Group.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated actuarially each year using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows.
The discount rate is based on market yields of high quality corporate bonds which are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity which approximate to those of the related pension liability.
Where the unallocated divisible surplus or equity holders funds are affected as a result of actuarial gains and losses on the dened benefit pension scheme, the charge or credit is not recognised in the income statement but through the statement of comprehensive income.
The benets paid from the dened benefit schemes are based on percentages of the employees final pensionable salary for each year of credited service.
The Group has no liability for retirement benets other than for pensions, except for a small scheme in LGF Indemnits fide Fin fide Carrire, which provides lump sum benets on retirement.
The Fund and Scheme account for all of the UK and over 97% of worldwide assets of the Groups dened benefit schemes.
