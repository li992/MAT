As part of this agreement, the Group and Pratt & Whitney will restructure their participation in IAE, which produces the V2500 engine for the Airbus A320 family of aircraft.
Under the terms of the agreement, which is subject to regulatory approvals, Rolls-Royce will sell its equity, programme share and related goodwill in IAE to Pratt & Whitney for US$1.5 billion.
The assets and liabilities shown above are those, included in the civil aerospace segment, that will be derecognised on the completion of the transaction.
However, as Rolls-Royce will continue to be responsible for the manufacture of high-pressure compressors, fan blades as well as the provision of engine support and final assembly of 50 per cent of V2500 engines, the transaction is not considered to give rise to a discontinued operation.
