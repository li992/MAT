Intangible assets Intangible assets consist of goodwill on acquisitions of $72.3m and renewal rights of $16.3m, purchased syndicate capacity of $10.8m, US admitted licences of $9.3m and capitalised expenditure on IT projects of $22.0m.
The increase in intangibles is primarily due to the acquisition of AIP in Australia for $20.6m, this included deferred consideration.
We also acquired additional syndicate capacity of $1.4m, taking the split of business between syndicates 2623 and 623 to 82%:18% for 2012.
This was offset by a decrease of $8.6m as we disposed of a business.
As part of the sale agreement we secured the renewal rights for this business for the next five years, accordingly we have capitalised this asset as renewal rights within intangible assets.
Reinsurance assets Reinsurance assets represent recoveries from reinsurers in respect of incurred claims of $995.7m, and the unearned reinsurance premiums reserve of $202.2m.
The reinsurance receivables from reinsurers are split between recoveries on claims paid or notified of $252.4m and an actuarial estimate of recoveries on claims that have not yet been reported of $743.3m.
The groups exposure to reinsurers is managed through: Minimising risk through selection of reinsurers who meet strict financial criteria eg minimum net assets, minimum A rating by S&P.
These criteria vary by type of business short vs medium-tail.
The chart on page 37 shows the profile of these assets based on S&P rating at the end of 2011: Timely calculation and issuance of reinsurance collection notes from our ceded reinsurance team: and Regular monitoring of outstanding debtor position by our reinsurance security committee and credit control committees.
We continue to provide against impairment of reinsurance recoveries, and at the end of 2011 we had provided $15.7m 2010: $17.3m in respect of reinsurance recoveries.

We continue to outsource the collection of our Lloyds premium broker balances to Randall and Quilter Investment Holdings plc, which operates within the Lloyds market as specialist credit controllers.
Other assets Other assets are analysed separately in the notes to the accounts.
The largest items included comprise: Deferred acquisition costs of $159.7m: Deferred tax assets available for use against future taxes payable of $12.5m: and Profit commissions receivable from syndicate 623 of $10.1m.
Insurance liabilities Insurance liabilities of $4,334.6m consist of two main elements, being the unearned premium reserve UPR and gross insurance claims liabilities.
Our unearned premiums reserve has reduced by 2% to $808.4m.
The majority of the UPR balance relates to current year premiums that have been deferred and will be earned in future periods.
Current indicators are that this business is profitable.
Gross insurance claims reserves are made up of claims which have been notified to us but not yet paid and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported IBNR.
These are estimated as part of the quarterly reserving process involving the underwriters and group actuary.
Gross insurance claims reserves have increased by 9% to $3,526.2m.
Financial liabilities Financial liabilities comprise borrowings and derivative financial liabilities.
The group utilises two long-term debt facilities: In 2006 we raised 150m of lower tier 2 unsecured fixed rate debt that is payable in 2026 and callable in 2016.
The initial interest rate payable is 7.25% and the current carrying value of this debt is $246.8m: and A US$18m subordinated debt facility raised in 2004.
This loan is also unsecured and interest is payable at the US interbank offered rate LIBOR plus 3.65%.
These subordinated notes are due in 2034 and have been callable at the groups option since 2009.
In July 2011 we renewed and extended our existing syndicated short-term banking facility led by Lloyds Banking Group Plc.
The facility provides potential borrowings up to $225m.
The new agreement is based on a commitment fee of 0.7% per annum and any amounts drawn are charged at a margin of 1.75% per annum.
The cash element of the facility will last for three years, expiring on 31 December 2014, whilst letters of credit issued under the facility can be used to provide support for the 2012 and 2013 underwriting years.
The facility is currently unutilised.
