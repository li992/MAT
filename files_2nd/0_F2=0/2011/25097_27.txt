The differences are explained below: 2011 2010 000 000 Total loss profit before tax per accounts 81,691 51,063 Corporation tax at 26.49% 2010: 28% 21,640 14,298 Effects of: Non-taxable UK dividend income 167 253 Non-taxable overseas dividend income 1,195 1,020 Movement in unutilised management expenses 1,163 1,235 Gains losses on investments not taxable 21,839 14,260 Overseas tax 413 316 Total current tax charge for the year 413 316 Investment companies which have been approved by the HM Revenue & Customs under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are exempt from tax on capital gains.
Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation of investments.
c The Company has unrelieved excess management expenses of 15,446,000 2010: 11,052,000.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
The unrecognised deferred tax asset amounts to 4,016,000 2010: 3,095,000.

The difference between the recommended dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 and the amount paid in 2011 was due to 600,000 Ordinary Shares being bought back following the date of approval of the Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2010 but before the record date of the final dividend for that year.
