ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements Information for shareholders 01 15 17 41 43 61 ICAP plc Annual Report 2011 63 133 134 Basis of preparation 71 Preparation of financial statements The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act applicable to companies reporting under IFRS and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified to include the fair value of certain financial instruments in accordance with IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and presented in millions.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the Group and Company are included within the notes to which they relate and are shaded in blue.
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Management consider goodwill note 12 and tax note 4 to be the areas where increased judgement is required.
This is discussed further in the notes relating to these areas.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making estimates, actual results reported in future periods may be based on amounts which differ from those estimates.
Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
This set of financial statements are the first in which the Group has presented the notes in an order that reflects managements view of the importance of information contained in the notes to the performance and position of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Details of the order of notes can be found in the index on page 74 of the financial statements.
Presentation of the income statement The Group maintains a columnar format for the presentation of its consolidated income statement.
The columnar format enables the Group to continue its practice of improving the understanding of its results by presenting profit for the year before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
This is the profit measure used to calculate adjusted EPS note 2 and is considered to be the most appropriate as it better reflects the Groups underlying cash earnings.
Profit before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items are reconciled to profit before tax on the face of the consolidated income statement.
For the financial year commencing 1 April 2010, and for future periods, the Group has redefined the column previously entitled amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation having considered the impact of the adoption of IFRS3 revised Business Combinations effective for the Group from 1 April 2010 to the consolidated income statement.
This column has accordingly been renamed as acquisition and disposal costs and will include: any re-measurement after initial recognition of deferred contingent consideration which has been classified as a liability: any gains or losses on the revaluation of previous interests: any gains or losses on the disposal of investments, associates or subsidiaries: and costs associated with a combination that do not constitute fees relating to the arrangement of financing.
The column may also include items such as gains or losses on the settlement of pre-existing relationships with acquired businesses and the re-measurement of liabilities that are above the value of indemnification.
To take into account the aforementioned changes the Group has also moved the impact of the unwind of the discounting of deferred contingent consideration into this column.
Accordingly, the comparative consolidated income statement has been re-presented within the financial statements.
For the year ending 31 March 2010 acquisition and disposal costs have increased by 2m from 40m to 42m.
The column will continue to include the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising on consolidation.
Each of the items reported under the acquisition and disposal column will be excluded from the calculation of adjusted basic EPS and adjusted diluted EPS note 2.
The Group believes this change will help to improve users of the financial statements understanding of the underlying results.
Items which are of a non-recurring nature and material, when considering both size and nature, are disclosed separately to give a clearer presentation of the Groups results.
These are shown as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement together with any adjustments to prior period exceptional items.
On the face of the consolidated income statement, basic and diluted EPS from continuing operations have also been disclosed.
This enables the Group to provide clarity of the EPS of the continuing core business.
The prior period basic and adjusted EPS have been re-presented to reflect the change in definition of the column acquisition and disposal costs resulting in an increase in the adjusted diluted EPS of 0.3p.
The Company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act not to present its own income statement and statement of comprehensive income.
Presentation of the balance sheet As part of the Groups broking activities in matched principal and exchange traded markets, the Group is required to hold a mix of cash, cash equivalents and other securities with those institutions which provide it with clearing and settlement services.
Balances represent deposits held with a clearer.
The Group has traditionally accounted for the cash elements of these balances as cash and cash equivalents on the basis that the nature of the Groups business model, which does not involve it taking proprietary positions, does not put the balances at risk.
However, following a review undertaken in 2010 11 it was determined that the balances could not be withdrawn on a same day basis and, as such, failed to meet the definition contained in IAS7 Statement of Cash Flows for cash and cash equivalents and it was therefore concluded that these balances should be separately identified on the face of the consolidated balance sheet and separately identified within the consolidated statement of cash flow under cash from operations.
The impact of re-presenting the balance results in a decrease in cash of 81m in the prior year and increased restricted funds by the same amount.
There is no impact to total current assets.
72 Basis of preparation continued Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated financial statements include the results and net assets of the Company, its subsidiaries and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
An entity is regarded as a subsidiary if the Group has control over its strategic, operating and financial policies and intends to hold the investment on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
The results of companies acquired during the year are included in the Groups results from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of companies disposed of during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
The Group treats transactions with non-controlling interests as transactions with equity owners of the Group.
For purchases from non-controlling interests, the difference between any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the subsidiary is recorded in equity.
Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies the Company and its subsidiaries are eliminated as part of the consolidation process.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, exercises joint control over its operating and financial policies.
An interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Joint ventures are proportionately consolidated, whereby the Groups consolidated income statement and balance sheet include the Groups share of the income and assets on a line-by-line basis.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Significant influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
Associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups consolidated income statement includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups consolidated balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
Foreign currencies In individual entities, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the prior month closing exchange rate between the functional currency and the foreign currency.
At each end of the reporting period, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Exchange differences are recognised in the consolidated income statement, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where these form part of the net investment of an overseas business or are designated as hedges of a net investment or cash flow and, therefore, the changes in value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
On consolidation, the results of businesses with non-pound sterling functional currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate to the rate at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities of overseas businesses are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the reporting period.
Exchange differences arising are recognised within other comprehensive income.
Cumulative translation differences arising after the transition to IFRS are taken to the consolidated income statement on disposal of the net investment.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a non-pound sterling entity are treated as assets and liabilities of that entity and translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the period closing rate.
Where applicable, the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising before the date of transition to IFRS as denominated in the presentational currency of the Group.
In the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the presentational currency of the Group at the average exchange rate for the year or at the rate prevailing at the time of the transaction where more appropriate.
Recent accounting developments The following new standards and amendments to standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2010 and are considered relevant to the Group.
IFRS3 revised, Business Combinations and consequential amendments to IAS27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, IAS28, Investments in Associates, and IAS31, Interests in Joint Ventures.
These changes apply to the Group prospectively for business combinations enacted on or after 1 April 2010.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations, with some significant changes.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classed as debt subsequently remeasured through the consolidated income statement.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisition-related costs should be expensed.
The Group expects that the impact on results will depend on the nature of transactions undertaken by the Group.
Contingent deferred consideration payable arising from acquisitions enacted before 1 April 2010 will be remeasured in accordance with IFRS3 as movements to goodwill and not through the consolidated income statement as required by IFRS3 revised.
