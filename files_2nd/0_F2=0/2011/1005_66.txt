42 Accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 The grant by the company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a capital contribution.
The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity.
2.12 Reserves Equity comprises the following: Share capital represents the nominal value of equity shares.
Share premium represents the excess over nominal value of the fair value of consideration received for equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue.
Coal royalty revaluation reserve represents revaluation of the coal royalty from the opening carrying value, excluding the effects of deferred tax and foreign currency changes.
Investment revaluation reserve represents gains and losses due to the revaluation of the investments in mining and exploration interests and other royalties from the opening carrying values, including the effects of deferred tax and foreign currency changes.
Share based payment reserve represents equity-settled share based employee remuneration until such share options are exercised.
Foreign currency reserve represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.
Special reserve represents the level of profit attributable to the Group for the period ended June 30, 2002 which was created as part of a capital reduction performed in 2002.
Investment in own shares represents the shares held by the Anglo Pacific Group Employee Benefit Trust for awards made under the Joint Share Ownership Plan note 26.
Retained earnings represents retained profits.
2.13 Revenue recognition The revenue of the Group comprises royalty income and amounts receivable from external customers for services excluding value added tax and other sales related taxes.
It is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.
The royalty income becomes receivable on extraction and sale of the relevant minerals, at which point the revenue is recognised.
Disposals of mining and exploration interests are disclosed net of any commissions and foreign exchange.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
2.14 Leases Rentals payable under operating leases where substantially all of the benefits and risks of ownership are not transferred to the lessee are charged against profits on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
2.15 Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
3 Financial risk management The Groups principal treasury objective is to provide sufficient liquidity to meet operational cash flow and dividend requirements and to allow the Group to take advantage of new growth opportunities whilst maximising shareholder value.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including liquidity risk, credit risk, foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
The Group operates controlled treasury policies which are monitored by the management to ensure that the needs of the Group are met while minimising potential adverse effects of unpredictability of financial markets on the Groups financial performance.
Liquidity and funding risk The objective of the Company in managing funding risk is to ensure that it can meet its financial obligations as and when they fall due.
At the year end there was no debt outstanding and the Company, with its strong balance sheet, had good access to capital markets, if required.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, royalty instruments held as financial assets, trade and other receivables and investments.
These represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its other receivables, including royalty receivables.
It is the policy of the Group to present the amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and the current economic environment.
Where possible the Group has registered its interests against the relevant mining titles for the royalties it has acquired.
In addition, the Group is generally entitled to full reconciliations of amounts paid and retains the right to audit the royalty returns and verify the calculations.
The Groups credit risk on royalty instruments held as financial instruments, has been reviewed and the estimated current exposure is as disclosed in note 17 where the future contractual right to cash flow from these instruments is reflected in their fair value.
The credit risk on bank deposits is limited because the counterparties have high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of currencies and counterparties.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Accounts Accounts 43 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 In 2007, the Group created a derivative financial instrument to provide finance to an unlisted mining development company, which has subsequently listed note 19.
This instrument is convertible into equity in the company or royalties over the companys properties at the Groups option for a period of up to five years.
In the event of default the instrument becomes repayable and the Group would rank equally with the companys other unsecured creditors.
The Group undertakes detailed analysis of factors which mitigate the risk of default to the Group on a regular basis.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups transactional foreign exchange exposure arises from income, expenditure and purchase and sale of assets denominated in foreign currencies.
As each material commitment is made, the risk in relation to currency fluctuations is assessed by the Board and regularly reviewed.
The Group does not consider it necessary to have a hedging programme in place at this time.
Foreign currency denominated financial assets and liabilities, translated into Sterling at the closing rate, are as follows: 2011 2010 GBP AUD CAD USD NOK EUR GBP AUD CAD USD NOK EUR 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Financial assets 1 37,928 30,514 3,117 3,191 6 3,501 61,321 37,273 350 12 Financial liabilities Short term exposure 1 37,928 30,514 3,117 3,191 6 3,501 61,321 37,273 350 12 The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the net result for the year and equity in regards to the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities and the Australian Dollar Sterling and the Canadian Dollar Sterling exchange rate.
It assumes a - 10% change of the Sterling Australian Dollar exchange rate for the year ended December 31, 2011 2010: 10%.
A - 10% is considered for the Sterling Canadian Dollar exchange rate 2010: 10%.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups foreign currency financial instruments held at balance sheet date.
If Sterling had weakened against the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar by 10% this would have had the following impact: 2011 2010 GBP AUD CAD USD NOK EUR GBP AUD CAD USD NOK EUR 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net result for the year 765 1,267 1 3,233 1,578 Equity 3,793 3,051 312 319 1 350 6,132 3,727 35 1 If Sterling had strengthened against the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar by 10% this would have had the following impact: 2011 2010 GBP AUD CAD USD NOK EUR GBP AUD CAD USD NOK EUR 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net result for the year 765 1,267 1 3,233 1,578 Equity 3,793 3,051 312 319 1 350 6,132 3,727 35 1 Exposures to foreign exchange rates vary during the year depending on the volume of overseas transactions.
Nonetheless, the analysis above is considered to be representative of the Groups exposure to currency risk.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of the cash balances held with banks and other highly rated counterparties.
If the interest rates the Group received had increased by one percent during the year, the net result for the year would have been increased by 268,000 2010: 1,215,000.
If the interest rates the Group received had decreased by one percent during the year, the net result for the year would have been reduced by 268,000 2010: 486,000.
There would have been no impact on equity.

A sensitivity analysis based on a 26% increase or decrease in listed equity prices has been performed 2010: 15%.
If the quoted stock price for these securities had increased or decreased by this percentage the net result for the year would have been increased reduced by 13.4 million 2010: 12.9 million.
Equity would have changed by 16.2 million 2010: 18.3 million.
The royalty portfolio exposes the Group to other price risk through fluctuations in commodity prices, particularly the prices of iron ore, gold and uranium.
As the directors obtain independent commodity price forecasts, the generation of which takes into account fluctuations in prices, no detailed analysis of the impact of fluctuations on the valuations of the royalties has been undertaken.
The Group is exposed to other price risk through its convertible instruments note 19 b that can be converted into equity or royalties.
The underlying value of the equity may change resulting in an increase or decrease in the value of the instrument.
As the equity is currently unlisted it is not possible to quantify this risk at this stage.
The Groups mining and exploration interests are held for the purposes of generating additional royalties and are considered long-term, strategic investments.
This strategy is unaffected by recent fluctuations in prices for mining and exploration equities: however, interests are continually monitored for indicators that may suggest problems for these companies raising capital or continuing their day-to-day business activities to ensure remedial action can be taken if necessary.
No specific hedging activities are undertaken in relation to these interests and the voting rights arising from these equity instruments are utilised in the Groups favour.
Anglo Pacific Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Accounts Accounts 45 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 Capital management and procedures The Groups capital management objectives are: to ensure the Groups ability to continue as a going concern: to increase the value of the assets of the Group: and to enhance shareholder value in the Company and returns to shareholders.
The achievement of these objectives is undertaken by developing existing assets and identifying new royalty acquisitions.
The Company will also undertake other transactions where these are deemed financially beneficial to the Company.
The directors continue to monitor the capital requirements of the Group by reference to expected future cash flows.
Capital for the reporting periods under review is summarised in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The Company does not presently need or have any long term funding.
Financial Assets The Group and Company held the following investments in financial assets: 2011 2010 Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 Availableforsale Royalty instruments 24,736 24,736 28,061 28,061 Mining and exploration interests 64,303 56,121 128,231 107,865 Fair value through profit or loss Royalty instruments Mining and exploration interests 248 248 248 248 Trade and other receivables 10,111 9,038 8,258 41,284 Cash and cash equivalents 32,197 43,672 28,258 3,986 Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits held by the Group treasury function.
The carrying amount of these assets is approximately their fair value.
Fair value hierarchy The following table presents financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the balance sheet in accordance with the fair value hierarchy.
This hierarchy groups financial assets and liabilities into three levels based on the significance of inputs used in measuring the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie.
as prices or indirectly ie.
derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
The level within which the financial asset or liability is classified is determined based on the lowest level of significant input to the fair value measurement.
The following tables present the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Group Note 000 000 000 000 Assets Royalty instruments a 24,736 24,736 Mining and exploration interests quoted b 62,389 62,389 Mining and exploration interests unquoted c 1,434 1,434 Mining and exploration interests royalty options d 728 728 Total 62,389 2,162 24,736 89,287 Net fair value 62,389 2,162 24,736 89,287 Anglo Pacific Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 46 Accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Group Note 000 000 000 000 Assets Royalty instruments a 28,061 28,061 Mining and exploration interests quoted b 121,863 121,863 Mining and exploration interests unquoted c 6,210 6,210 Mining and exploration interests royalty options d 406 406 Total 121,863 6,616 28,061 156,540 Net fair value 121,863 6,616 28,061 156,540 The following tables present the Companys assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010: 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Company Note 000 000 000 000 Assets Royalty instruments a 24,736 24,736 Mining and exploration interests quoted b 54,656 54,656 Mining and exploration interests unquoted c 985 985 Mining and exploration interests royalty options d 728 728 Total 54,656 1,713 24,736 81,105 Net fair value 54,656 1,713 24,736 81,105 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Company Note 000 000 000 000 Assets Royalty instruments a 28,061 28,061 Mining and exploration interests quoted b 101,983 101,983 Mining and exploration interests unquoted c 5,724 5,724 Mining and exploration interests royalty options d 406 406 Total 101,983 6,130 28,061 136,174 Net fair value 101,983 6,130 28,061 136,174 There have been no significant transfers between levels 1 and 2 in the reporting period.
The methods and valuation techniques used for the purposes of measuring fair value are unchanged compared to the previous reporting period.
a Royalty instruments The Groups royalty streams arising from its four royalty instruments have been classified as available for sale, with value on initial recognition being calculated as the total cost of the agreement less the valuation of the option to convert to shares.
At reporting date the royalty streams have been valued on the net present value of the pre-tax cash flows discounted at a rate management considers reflects the risk associated with each of the projects.
Note 17 details the discount rates used.
The option to convert to shares has been treated as fair value through profit or loss as designated on initial recognition at the date of acquisition and has been valued at December 31, 2011 utilising an option model.
The key assumptions, in addition to those utilised in the royalty stream valuations such as mine life and expected cash flows, include the price, volatility of the projects listed equity and where applicable the conversion price and redemption value of redeemable shares.
b Mining and exploration interests quoted All the quoted mining and exploration interests have been issued by publicly traded companies in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Norway.
Fair values for these securities have been determined by reference to their quoted bid prices at the reporting date.
c Mining and exploration interests unquoted All the unquoted mining and exploration interests are initially recognised using cost where fair value cannot be reliably determined.
