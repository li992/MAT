Impairment review of goodwill $ million Goodwill at 31 December 2011 2010 Exploration and Production 7,931 4,450 Rening and Marketing 4,014 4,074 Other businesses and corporate 155 74 12,100 8,598 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition.
For Exploration and Production, goodwill is held at the segment level: previously it was allocated to each geographic region UK, US and Rest of World see below.
For Rening and Marketing, goodwill has been allocated to the Rhine fuels value chain FVC, Lubricants and Other.
In assessing whether goodwill has been impaired, the carrying amount of the cash-generating unit including goodwill is compared with the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a cash-generating unit, the recoverable amount is deemed to be the value in use.
The group calculates the value in use using a discounted cash ow model.
The future cash ows are adjusted for risks specic to the cash-generating unit and are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate.
The discount rate is derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital and is adjusted where applicable to take into account any specic risks relating to the country where the cash-generating unit is located.
The rate to be applied to each country is reassessed each year.
Discount rates of 12% and 14% have been used for goodwill impairment calculations performed in 2011 2010 12% and 14%.
The business segment plans, which are approved on an annual basis by senior management, are the primary source of information for the determination of value in use.
They contain forecasts for oil and natural gas production, renery throughputs, sales volumes for various types of rened products e. g. gasoline and lubricants, revenues, costs and capital expenditure.
As an initial step in the preparation of these plans, various environmental assumptions, such as oil prices, natural gas prices, rening margins, rened product margins and cost ination rates, are set by senior management.
These environmental assumptions take account of existing prices, global supply-demand equilibrium for oil and natural gas, other macroeconomic factors and historical trends and variability.
Exploration and Production $ million 2011 2010 Rest of Total UK US world Total Goodwill 7,931 341 3,479 630 4,450 Excess of recoverable amount over carrying amount 49,247 7,556 18,968 41,714 n a The value in use is based on the cash ows expected to be generated by the projected oil or natural gas production proles up to the expected dates of cessation of production of each producing eld.
As the production prole and related cash ows can be estimated from BPs past experience, management believes that the cash ows generated over the estimated life of eld is the appropriate basis upon which to assess goodwill and individual assets for impairment.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, the production prole of the hydrocarbons, the cost of the development of the infrastructure necessary to recover the hydrocarbons, the production costs, the contractual duration of the production concession and the selling price of the hydrocarbons produced.
As each producing eld has specic reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the cash ows of the elds are computed using appropriate individual economic models and key assumptions agreed by BPs management for the purpose.
Capital expenditure and operating costs for the first four years and expected hydrocarbon production proles up to 2020 are derived from the business segment plan.
Estimated production quantities and cash ows up to the date of cessation of production on a eld-by-eld basis are developed to be consistent with this.
The production proles used are consistent with the resource volumes approved as part of BPs centrally-controlled process for the estimation of proved reserves and total resources.
Prior to 2011, goodwill in the Exploration and Production segment was allocated to each geographic region, that is UK, US and Rest of World, and impairment reviews of goodwill were performed at this level.
Following a reorganization of the Exploration and Production segment, the group has revised the way goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Given the global nature of our upstream business, the impairment review of goodwill is now performed at the Exploration and Production segment level.
Consistent with prior years, the 2011 review for impairment was carried out during the fourth quarter.
The table above shows the carrying amount of the goodwill for the segment and the excess of the recoverable amount over the carrying amount the headroom.
Consistent with prior periods, midstream and intangible oil and gas assets were excluded from the headroom calculation.
The Brent oil price assumption used in the impairment review of goodwill is shown in the table below.
2011 2017 and 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 thereafter Brent oil price $ bbl 106 101 97 94 92 90 2010 2016 and 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 thereafter Brent oil price $ bbl 85 88 89 89 90 75 Key assumptions for oil and gas prices for the first five years were derived from forward price curves in the fourth quarter.
Prices in 2017 and beyond were determined using long-term views of global supply and demand, building upon past experience of the industry and consistent with external sources.
These prices were adjusted to arrive at appropriate consistent price assumptions for different qualities of oil and gas, or where appropriate, contracted oil and gas prices were applied.
