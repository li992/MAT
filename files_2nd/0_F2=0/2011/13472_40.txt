c The purchase of Riversdale has been treated as a step acquisition.
Non-controlling interests of US$1,498 million arose at the acquisition date, when Rio Tintos share in Riversdale reached 52.6 per cent.
These non-controlling interests reversed as Rio Tinto increased its interests in Riversdale to 100 per cent.
An amount of US$479 million has been recognised directly in equity in The financial statements on pages 131 to 215 were approved by the directors on 5 March 2012 and signed on their behalf by relation to Rio Tintos interests purchased after the acquisition date, representing the excess of consideration paid to acquire these additional shareholdings, over non-controlling interests acquired.
Refer to note 39. d A reduction of US$339 million in non-controlling interests arose as Rio Tinto increased its economic share in Oyu Tolgoi through the acquisition of additional interests in Ivanhoe Mines Ltd.
Adjustments to retained earnings attributable to owners of Rio Tinto of US$129 million relate to the aggregate excess of consideration paid for the additional investments in Ivanhoe, over the value of the additional economic share acquired in Oyu Tolgoi.
Refer to note 39. e In relation to the Groups purchase of an additional indirect stake in Coal & Allied, adjustments to retained earnings of US$185 million were made for the excess of consideration paid to acquire shareholdings of US$45 million from non-controlling interests.
