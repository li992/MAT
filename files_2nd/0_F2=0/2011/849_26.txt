As at 31 December 2011, the reduction in the rate to 25 per cent on 1 April 2012 has been substantively enacted.
The change in deferred tax has resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of 2 million which has been recognised in the income statement.
However, the remaining reductions in the rate have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore the proposed changes are not reflected in the figures reported.
The decrease in the rate from 25 per cent to 23 per cent would reduce the balance sheet deferred tax asset by approximately 1 million and would reduce unrecognised deferred tax assets by approximately 1 million.
During the period to 2014, AMEC estimate that the effect of the proposed changes to income and equity would be a charge of 1 million to the income statement.

The review of unamortised goodwill for indications of impairment by management is performed against the three core segments of Natural Resources, Power & Process and Environment & Infrastructure being the lowest level of cash generating units CGU monitored for goodwill purposes.
This is consistent with the integration of acquisitions into the three segments in order to generate synergies.
Goodwill has been allocated between segments on a relative fair value basis.
The recoverable amount of the CGU has been based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use cash flow projections included in the financial budgets approved by management covering a two-year period and pre-tax discount rates as set out in the table below.
Given the current market conditions, management believe that the discount rates chosen are conservative.
For the purposes of the calculation of the recoverable amount, the cash flow projections beyond the two-year period include 2 per cent growth per annum 2010: 2 per cent, which is in line with long-term average growth rates for the regions in which the CGUs operate.
The value-in-use has been compared to the carrying value for each CGU and no impairment is required nor has been charged in respect of any of the CGUs.
The financial budgets are developed using an assumed workload and margin for the following year.
Workload is underpinned by a secured order book for each CGU, and order book remains strong at 3.7 billion as at 31 December 2011 2010: 3.1 billion.
The margin selected is based on managements review of the margins on orders received and is consistent with Vision 2015 objectives.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed, at the individual CGU level, in order to review the impact of changes in key assumptions.
For example, a 10 per cent decrease in volume, with all other assumptions held constant, or a 1 per cent decrease in margin, with all other assumptions held constant, did not identify any impairments.
Similarly, zero growth after the initial two-year period, with all other assumptions held constant or a 1 per cent increase in discount rate, did not identify any material impairments.
Goodwill of 2 million has been allocated to a small business divested during the year.

Substantially all UK members are in funded defined benefit schemes, with the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuation of the two major UK schemes as at 31 March 2011 and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2011.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December 2011.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 4.7 5.4 Rate of inflation 3.0 3.4 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 4.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment service before after 1 January 2008 3.0 2.3 3.4 2.4 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 8.1 7.7 Bonds 4.7 5.4 Gilts 3.1 4.2 Property 5.1 6.2 The main overseas schemes as at 31 December 2011 consist of three defined benefit schemes held in Canada and The Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan that was acquired as part of the acquisition of MACTEC.
The obligations have been measured in accordance with IAS 19.
A discount rate of 4.6 per cent 2010: 5.4 per cent and salary inflation rate of 2.75 per cent 2010: 3.25 per cent have been used for the three defined benefit schemes held in Canada.
A discount rate of 4.6 per cent has been used for the Law Companies Group, Inc Pension Plan retirement scheme.
No further benefits are being accrued in this scheme.
90 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 14 Retirement benefit assets and liabilities continued For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows: 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2011 2011 2010 2010 Male Female Male Female years years years years Member aged 65 current life expectancy 22.7 24.1 21.4 23.7 Member aged 45 life expectancy at 65 24.5 26.1 23.3 25.5 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 5.4 per cent assumption as at 31 December 2011 2010: 5.9 per cent.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 million million Retirement benefit assets 32 63 Retirement benefit liabilities 81 36 Retirement benefit net liability assets 49 27 The retirement benefit liabilities of 81 million 2010: 36 million reflect primarily the deficits on the overseas schemes.

94 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 15 Deferred tax assets and liabilities continued Factors affecting the tax charge in future years There are a number of factors that may affect the groups future tax charge including the resolution of open issues with tax authorities, corporate acquisitions and disposals, the use of brought-forward losses and changes in tax legislation and tax rates.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 million million Deductible temporary differences 15 20 Tax losses 20 48 35 68 Tax losses and deductible temporary differences not recognised by the group do not expire under current tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the group can utilise these assets.
In addition, claims have been made to HM Revenue & Customs HMRC to offset tax losses of up to 79 million against the groups UK taxable profits.
These losses were generated in a legacy German business in accounting periods up to 31 December 2002.
If successful, the claims will result in a refund of UK Corporation tax.
The amount and availability of the refund depends on a number of factors which are currently being discussed with HMRC.
This potential refund is not included as an asset in the accounts.
Unrecognised deferred tax liabilities No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of 474 million 2010: 382 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures because the group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is not probable that such differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities in respect of these unremitted earnings is estimated to be 24 million 2010: 19 million.

96 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 19 Capital and financial risk management Capital management The objective of the groups capital management is to ensure that it has a strong financial position from which to grow the business to meet its Vision 2015 targets and is able to maximise shareholder value.
The appropriate capital structure for the group would comprise of a mix of debt and equity.
The mix would be determined by considering business profile and strategy, financial policies and availability and cost of funding.
The group is currently in a net cash position.
If debt is subsequently required, the long-term net debt is expected to be no more than two times EBITDA.
The group may exceed this operating parameter should the business profile require it.
However, it is expected that any increases would be temporary given the net operational cash flows of the group.
In February 2012, the board approved a share buyback programme of 400 million which is expected to be completed over the next 12 months.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes for managing capital during 2011 or 2010.
Financial risk management The principal financial risks to which the group is exposed are: foreign currency exchange risk: funding and liquidity risk: counterparty credit risk: and interest rate risk.
The board has approved policies for the management of these risks.
The groups treasury department manages funding, liquidity and risks arising from movements in interest and foreign currency rates within a framework of policies and guidelines approved by the board.
The treasury department does not operate as a profit centre and the undertaking of speculative transactions is not permitted.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised and reviewed by the board, most recently in October 2011.
Foreign currency exchange risk The group publishes its consolidated accounts in Sterling.
The majority of the groups trading income is denominated in the local currency of the business operations which provides a natural hedge against the currency of its cost base.
Where commercial contracts are undertaken which are denominated in foreign currencies, the group seeks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk, when the cash flow giving rise to such exposure becomes certain or highly probable, through the use of forward currency arrangements, which may include the purchase of currency options.
There are currently no material transactional exposures which have been identified and remain unhedged.
AMEC has no reason to believe that any outstanding forward contract will not be able to be settled from the underlying commercial transactions.
A portion of the groups earnings is generated in non-Sterling currencies.
Such overseas profits are translated into Sterling at the average exchange rate prevailing throughout the year.
There is currently no hedging in place for profits generated in non-Sterling currencies but the impact on group profits is monitored on an ongoing basis.
In addition, the group has various assets denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars and Canadian dollars.
A proportion of these assets, including unamortised goodwill, have been designated in net investment hedges using cross-currency instruments.
The policy was changed in 2009 to cease translation hedging for core assets of the business.
The existing hedging contracts will not be replaced as they mature.
In specific circumstances, for example the planned repatriation of foreign assets, the group may from time to time enter into new net investment hedges to manage foreign exchange risks.
Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk cash flow hedges The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs in, non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and are designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2011 2010 2011 2010 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 4 13 Current liabilities 39 17 4 3 43 30 4 3 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 97 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Capital and financial risk management continued The following tables indicate the periods in which the cash flows associated with the forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur and the periods in which they are expected to impact profit or loss: 2011 Carrying Expected 12 months 1-2 2-5 amount cash flows or less years years million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 4 4 Liabilities 4 39 38 1 4 43 42 1 2010 Carrying Expected 12 months 1-2 2-5 amount cash flows or less years years million million million million million Forward exchange contracts Assets 13 11 2 Liabilities 3 17 7 9 1 3 30 18 11 1 In 2011, nil 2010: charge of 1 million of ineffectiveness was recognised in cost of sales in the income statement.
Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk fair value through income statement Certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2011 2010 2011 2010 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 76 121 2 1 Current liabilities 125 36 3 2 201 157 1 1 Hedging of foreign currency exchange risk net investment hedges The group currently uses forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps which have been designated as hedges of the net investments in subsidiaries in Canada and the US.
The group has revised its policy and no new contracts will be taken out in the future.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2011 2010 2011 2010 Notional Notional Carrying Carrying contract contract amount and amount and amount amount fair value fair value million million million million Current assets 118 2 Non-current assets 22 1 Current liabilities 33 101 8 22 Non-current liabilities 14 143 3 12 165 266 9 33 A net foreign exchange gain for the year of 4 million 2010: loss of 11 million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these forward foreign exchange contracts and currency interest rate swaps.
98 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 19 Capital and financial risk management continued Sensitivity analysis The group hedges its material transaction related exposures and hence has no material transactional profit or loss sensitivity.
With respect to translation related exposure, the group hedges a proportion of assets denominated in foreign currencies.
A 10 per cent movement in Sterling Canadian dollar and Sterling US dollar rates results in a 14 million credit charge 2010: 25 million credit charge to other comprehensive income arising on net investment hedges.
Funding and liquidity risk The groups policy aims to ensure the constant availability of an appropriate amount of funding to meet both current and future forecast requirements consistent with the groups budget and strategic plans.
The group will finance operations and growth from its significant existing cash resources and as such no additional facilities are currently in place.
The requirement to enter into external facilities has been kept under review during 2011.
Appropriate facilities will be maintained to meet ongoing requirements for performance related bonding and letters of credit.
Counterparty credit risk The group is exposed to credit risk to the extent of non-payment by either its customers or the counterparties of its financial instruments.
The effective monitoring and controlling of credit risk is a key component of the groups risk management activities.
The credit risk associated with customers is considered as part of each tender review process and is addressed initially via contract payment terms, and, where appropriate, payment security is sought.
Credit control practices are applied thereafter during the project execution phase.
A right to interest and suspension is normally sought in all contracts.
Credit risks arising from treasury activities are managed by a central treasury function in accordance with the board approved treasury policy.
The objective of the policy is to diversify and minimise the groups exposure to credit risk from its treasury activities by ensuring that surplus funds are placed with a diversified range of 25-30 mainstream banks and with each counterparty up to a pre-approved limit.
These limits are set at prudent levels by the board and are based primarily on credit ratings set by Moodys, Standard & Poor's and Fitch.
Credit ratings are monitored continuously by the group treasury department.
The group treasury department monitors counterparty exposure on a global basis to avoid an over-concentration of exposure to any one counterparty.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.

Net receivables as at 31 December 2011 include 2 million 2010: 2 million in respect of amounts overdue by more than one year.
The group believes there is no material exposure in respect of these balances.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 99 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 19 Capital and financial risk management continued The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 million million As at 1 January 22 20 Exchange movements 2 Net impairment allowance credited 2 As at 31 December 20 22 Based on past experience, the group believes that no material impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due.
Trade receivable exposures are typically with large companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The groups most significant customer in 2011 accounted for around 14 per cent 2010: 22 per cent of continuing revenues, and a similar percentage of current trade and other receivables.
Interest rate risk - The group remained in a net cash position throughout the year.
Long-term interest rate hedging for periods beyond three to six months is not considered appropriate as the surplus cash position is viewed as temporary.
Interest rate risk contractual maturity and effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature: 2011 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less Per cent million million Short-term investments 1.15 28 28 Cash and cash equivalents 0.99 493 493 521 521 2010 Effective 6 months interest rate Total or less Per cent million million Short-term investments 1.08 196 196 Cash and cash equivalents 0.55 544 544 740 740 Fair values The carrying values of all financial instruments held at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 equate to their fair values.
Fair values are determined using observable market prices level 2 as defined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures as follows: Trade and other receivables and payables, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments are valued at their amortised cost, which are deemed to reflect fair value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.

None of the other businesses acquired made a material contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from their acquisition to 31 December 2011, nor would they have done in the year ended 31 December 2011 if they had been acquired on 1 January 2011.
Intangible assets recognised at fair value on the acquisition of these businesses included brands, trade names, customer relationships, order backlogs and non-compete agreements.

The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of MACTEC were as follows: Recognised value million Property, plant and equipment 4 Intangible assets 54 Indemnities received 23 Trade and other receivables 65 Cash and cash equivalents 14 Current tax payable 2 Trade and other payables 45 Deferred tax liability 7 Retirement benefit liabilities 20 Provisions 23 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 63 Goodwill on acquisition 120 183 Consideration Cash paid on completion 123 paid to repay debt 60 183 106 AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 24 Acquisitions and disposals continued Goodwill has been recognised on this acquisition through recognition of the value of its workforce of circa 2,600 mostly highly skilled technical professionals which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets as at the date of acquisition.
MACTECs 70 offices are mainly based in eastern USA, complementing the strength of the existing AMEC Environment & Infrastructure business in western USA and Canada.
The acquisition also provides significant opportunities for synergy benefits and cost savings.
Other acquisitions Other acquisitions were made in the year for a total consideration of 14 million of which 11 million was paid on completion with the balance of 3 million dependent on the achievement of set targets for labour revenue growth.
The aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets was 6 million, which consisted of 6 million relating to other intangible assets, cash and cash equivalents of 1 million and other net liabilities of 1 million.
Goodwill arising was 8 million and has been recognised as a result of expected synergies.
A further 16 million was paid in the period in respect of businesses acquired in 2010 and prior years.
Disposal in 2011 There was one small disposal made during the year.
In addition, there were various cash payments in respect of businesses sold in prior years and adjustments to provisions held in respect of prior year disposals resulting in a net loss of 2 million and a net cash outflow of 9 million.
Acquisitions in 2010 The following purchases have been accounted for as acquisitions.
None of the businesses acquired made a material contribution to consolidated revenue and profit in the period from their acquisition to 31 December 2010, nor would they have done in the year ended 31 December 2010 if they had been acquired on 1 January 2010.
Currie & Brown Australia Pty Limited On 29 January 2010, the group acquired all of the shares in Currie & Brown Australia Pty Limited.
The name of this company was subsequently changed to Aquenta Consulting Pty Limited 'Aquenta'.
Aquenta trades almost entirely in Australia and is a provider of independent cost, contract and consulting services to the oil and gas, mining, building, transport, utilities and infrastructure sectors.
The business provides similar services to the existing AMEC subsidiary Rider Hunt International Limited and was acquired to increase the size of the consultancy services business.
This is fully aligned with AMECs Vision 2015 strategy of assured growth, through a strengthened geographic footprint in key regions and enhanced capabilities in chosen sectors.
It builds on AMECs earlier acquisition of GRD Minproc.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Aquenta were as follows: Recognised value million Property, plant and equipment 1 Intangible assets 2 Trade and other receivables 5 Cash and cash equivalents 2 Trade and other payables 7 Deferred tax liability 1 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 2 Goodwill on acquisition 16 18 Consideration Cash - paid on completion 18 Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Aquenta primarily due to its skilled workforce positioned within the strong Australian market which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets as at the date of acquisition.
AMEC plc annual report and accounts 2011 107 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 24 Acquisitions and disposals continued Entec Holdings Limited On 29 March 2010, the group acquired all of the shares in Entec Holdings Limited 'Entec'.
Entec is a UK-based environmental and engineering consultancy, and was acquired to provide opportunity for leadership positioning in the UK geographical area, particularly in the water services sector.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Entec were as follows: Recognised value million Property, plant and equipment 1 Intangible assets 27 Trade and other receivables 15 Cash and cash equivalents 1 Trade and other payables 11 Deferred tax liability 8 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 25 Goodwill on acquisition 43 68 Consideration Cash paid on completion 51 paid to repay debt 11 Contingent consideration 6 68 In addition to the consideration set out above, up to a further 1 million was payable as deferred compensation depending upon continuing employment of three former shareholders for the one year following the acquisition date.
The contingent consideration of 6 million shown above was dependent upon achievement of a profit target for the year following the acquisition date.
The profit targets were achieved and the deferred consideration was paid during the year ended 31 December 2011.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Entec primarily through the acquisition of Entecs expertise in various environmental fields, primarily water services, as well as expected synergies.
Other acquisitions A number of smaller acquisitions were made in 2010 for 9 million in cash paid on completion.
The aggregate fair value of identifiable net assets was nil including cash acquired of 1 million and goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 9 million.
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of their skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets at the dates of acquisition.

Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
Provisions of 54 million 2010: 50 million are shown in note 21 in respect of these claims.
It is not practicable to quantify the remaining contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
AMEC Group Limited AGL is currently the subject of ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in respect of an incident involving a fatality to a subcontractor at the Leftbank Apartments project in Manchester in April 2004 where AMEC was principal contractor.
A summons has been received and AMEC entered a not guilty plea.
The case was heard at Liverpool Crown Court in June 2011 and resulted in a hung jury and a retrial will be held in March 2012.
If AGL is found guilty and prosecuted for this case, it could be liable to unlimited fines.
However it is considered improbable that this case will result in a material liability for AGL.
