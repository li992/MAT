FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements For the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Home Retail Group plc the Company, which is the ultimate parent company of Home Retail Group the Group, is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The Group is a home and general merchandise retailer.
These consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 April 2011.
Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee interpretations IFRICs as adopted by the European Union.
They also comply with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
BASIS OF PREPARATION The Group consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared under the historic cost basis modied for the revaluation of certain financial instruments, share-based payments and post-employment benets.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out in note 3.
Unless otherwise stated, these policies have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the ultimate parent company Home Retail Group plc, entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries and the Groups share of its interests in joint ventures and associates.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are consistent with the policies adopted by the Group for the purposes of the Groups consolidation.
Subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity whose operating and nancing policies are controlled by the Group.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control was transferred to the Group.
Subsidiaries cease to be consolidated from the date that the Group no longer has control.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Home Retail Group companies have been eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long-term basis and which are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other interested parties under a contractual agreement.
Associates are entities over which the Group has signi cant inuence but not control.
The equity method is used to account for investments in joint ventures and associates and investments are initially recognised at cost.
The Groups share of net assets of its joint ventures and associates is included on the Group balance sheet.
The Groups share of its joint ventures and associates post-acquisition profits or losses is recognised in its income statement.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying value of the investment.
The carrying amount of an investment in a joint venture or associate is tested for impairment by comparing its recoverable amount to its carrying amount whenever there is an indication that the investment may be impaired.
Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of business acquisitions is the aggregate of fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The cost of a business combination is allocated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria at their fair values at that date.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
Intangible assets are recognised if they meet the denition of an intangible asset contained in IAS 38 and its fair value can be measured reliably.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Changes in accounting standards The following new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations are effective for the first time for the current year: A mendment to IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements: Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Disclosure provisions superseded by IFRS 7 effective 2007: Amendment to IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items: Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards relating to restructuring of IFRS 1 and limited additional exemptions for first-time adopters : Amendment to IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-Based Payment: Amendment to IFRS 3 Business Combinations: Improvements to IFRSs April 2009 : and IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners.
60 Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS These new standards, amendments to existing standards and interpretations have not however had a material impact on the results or financial position of the Group.
At the balance sheet date a number of amendments to existing standards were in issue but not yet effective: Amendment to IAS 12 Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: Amendment to IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures: Amendments to IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards relating to a limited scope exemption for IFRS 7 disclosures, severe hyperination and removal of xed dates for first-time adopters : Amendment to IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Amendment to IFRIC 14 IAS 19 The Limit on a fide ned benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction: Annual Improvements to IFRSs May 2010 : and IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments.
The Group has not early-adopted any of these amendments to existing standards.
Their impact will be fully considered in due course.
There are no other new standards or IFRICs not yet effective which are expected to have a material impact.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
The resulting accounting estimates, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of the financial statements, will, by denition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and future periods where appropriate.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Taxes The Group is subject to taxes in a number of jurisdictions.
significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes as there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business.
The Group recognises liabilities based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the results for the year and the respective income tax and deferred tax provisions in the year in which such determination is made.
Post-employment bene ts The present value of the fide ned benefit obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The assumptions used in determining the fide ned benefit obligations and net pension costs include the expected long-term rate of return on the relevant scheme assets and the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions may impact the amounts disclosed in the Groups balance sheet and income statement.
The expected return on scheme assets is calculated by reference to the scheme investments at the year-end and is a weighted average of the expected returns on each main asset type based on market yields available on these asset types at the year-end.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outows expected to be required to settle the fide ned benefit obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity consistent with the estimated average term of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for fide ned bene t obligations and pension costs are based in part on market conditions at the relevant year-ends and additional information is disclosed in note 23.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units CGUs at the level of each business segment.
The Group is required to assess whether goodwill has suffered any impairment loss on an annual basis, based on the recoverable amount, being the higher of the CGUs fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
The value-in-use calculations require the use of estimates in relation to future cash ows and suitable discount rates as disclosed in note 13.
Actual outcomes could vary from these estimates.
Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 61 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011 2.
BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED Impairment of assets Assets are subject to impairment reviews whenever changes in events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred.
Assets are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Value-in-use is calculated by discounting the expected cash ows from the asset at an appropriate discount rate for the risks associated with that asset.
This includes estimates of both the expected cash ows and an appropriate discount rate which use managements assumptions and estimates of the future performance of the asset.
Differences between expectations and the actual cash ows will result in differences in the level of impairment required.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if there has been a significant change in the underlying assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount, however not to an amount higher than the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of amortisation or depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised in prior years.
Provisions Provisions have been estimated for onerous leases, insurance and other liabilities.
These provisions represent the best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date, the actual liability being dependent on future events such as trading conditions at a particular store or the incidence of insurance claims against the Group.
Expectations will be revised each period until the actual liability arises, with any difference accounted for in the period in which the revision is made.
Inventory provisions Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value which requires the estimation of the eventual sales price of goods to customers in the future.
Net realisable value takes into account slow moving, obsolete and defective inventory.
Any difference between the expected and the actual sales price achieved will be accounted for in the period in which the sale is made.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, discounts and returns.
Revenue is recognised as follows: Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue on goods to be delivered is recognised when the customer receives delivery of the goods.
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods being sold at a discount to the standard retail price.
Revenue is shown net of value added tax, returns and discounts.
Commissions receivable on the sale of services for which the Group acts as agent are included within revenue.
A provision for estimated returns is made, representing the profit on goods sold during the year which will be returned and refunded after the year-end.
Interest income Interest income on customer store card accounts and loans is recognised as revenue using the effective interest method.
Foreign currency translation Functional and presentation currency The consolidated financial information is presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and the Groups presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
Transactions and balances Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject to effective cash ow hedges.
Translation differences on non-monetary items are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
62 Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Group companies The results and financial position of overseas Home Retail Group entities are translated into sterling as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet: income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period: and all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities are taken to equity.
Tax charges and credits attributable to those exchange differences are taken directly to equity.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.
Goodwill Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identi able net assets of a subsidiary, associate or joint venture acquired at the date of acquisition.
Fair values are attributed to the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reecting their condition at that date.
Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not amortised and is tested at least annually for impairment.
An impairment charge is recognised where the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use calculations are performed using cash ow projections discounted at a rate taking account of the specic risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where necessary on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria are satisfied.
These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate resources to complete the development and how the asset will generate probable future economic bene t. The cost of other intangible assets with nite useful economic lives is amortised over that period.
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
If impaired, they are written down to the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use.
Brands Acquired brands have a nite useful life and are initially recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently held at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated to spread the cost of the brands over their estimated useful lives of 10 years on a straight-line basis.
This amortisation method reects the pattern in which the assets future economic benets are expected to be consumed.
Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over three to five years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic benets beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 3 to 10 years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programs are recognised as an expense as incurred.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 63 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011 3.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are held at cost being the purchase price and other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset into use less accumulated depreciation and any impairment in value.
An impairment charge is recognised where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, being the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
Value-in-use calculations are performed using cash ow projections discounted at a rate taking account of the specic risks inherent within the Groups businesses.
Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis as follows: freehold properties are depreciated over 50 years: leasehold premises are depreciated over the period of the lease: plant, vehicles and equipment are depreciated over 2 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset: land is not depreciated: and assets under the course of construction are not depreciated.
Receivables Trade Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the balance sheet, with the cost of unrecoverable trade receivables recognised in the income statement immediately.
Financial services The gross margin from the sale of a retail product on extended credit terms is recognised at the time of the sale of the retail product.
Income under instalment agreements is credited to the income statement using the effective interest method.
When a receivable is impaired, the Group reduces the carrying amount to its recoverable amount.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost bases in use within the Group are general retail goods valued on a standard cost or weighted average basis which approximates to actual cost.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Costs of inventory include the transfer from equity of any gains or losses on qualifying cash ow hedges relating to their purchase.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
Current asset investments Current asset investments include cash on deposit held with banks, with original maturities of greater than three months.
Trade payables Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business from suppliers.
They are classi ed as current liabilities if payment is due within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
They are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently remeasured at amortised cost.
Borrowings and borrowing costs All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value and other borrowing costs is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Current and non-current tax Current tax and non-current tax are based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
64 Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts.
However, if the deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable pro t will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when: t he Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is m ore likely than not that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and t he amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses.
Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outow will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole.
A provision is recognised even if the likelihood of an out ow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specic to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is certain.
Provisions are made for onerous lease contracts for stores that have closed or where a decision to close has been announced, and for those stores where the projected future trading revenue is insufficient to cover the lower of exit cost or value-in-use.
Provisions are also made for legal claims, restructuring costs and estimated cost of claims incurred by the Groups captive insurance company but not settled at the balance sheet date.
Operating leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classied as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the life of the lease.
Post-employment bene ts The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of fide ned benefit pension plans is the present value of the fide ned benefit obligations at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past service costs.
The fide ned bene t obligations are calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected-unit credit method.
The present value of the fide ned benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For dened contribution pension plans the Group and employees pay contributions into an independently administered fund.
The cost of providing these benets, recognised in the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 65 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011 3.
SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Catalogue costs Costs incurred during the production of the Groups catalogues are deferred on the balance sheet net of any associated advertising revenue and marketing support until the catalogue is made available to the Group, at which point the net deferred cost is charged to the income statement.
Dividends Dividends proposed by the Board of Directors and unpaid at the year-end are not recognised in the financial statements until they have been approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Interim dividends are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid.
Insurance Certain of the Groups insurance policies are maintained by the Groups captive insurance company, Global Guernsey Limited, which accounts for all insurance business on an annual basis and the net consolidated result is dealt with as part of the operating costs in these financial statements.
Insurance premiums in respect of insurance placed with third parties and re-insurance premiums in respect of risks not retained by the Groups captive insurance company are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Financial instruments The Group classies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The classication depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments were acquired.
Management determines the classication of its financial instruments at initial recognition.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss Financial assets and liabilities at fair value are so designated by management on initial recognition.
Derivatives are generally designated as hedges.
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are initially recorded at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in their fair value presented in the income statement.
Items in this category are classied as current assets or current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date, which are classied as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents and current asset investments in the balance sheet.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classied in any of the other categories.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value or, where fair value cannot be reliably measured, at cost less impairment.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates derivatives as either cash ow hedges or fair value hedges.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash ows of hedged items.
Movements on the hedging reserve in equity are shown in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
Cash ow hedges The cash ow hedges are intended to hedge the foreign currency exposures of the future purchases of inventory.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
Any gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion would be recognised immediately in the income statement.
The hedged cash ow is expected to occur up to 14 months into the future and will be transferred to the consolidated income statement via inventory carrying value as applicable.
66 Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of forward currency exchange contracts hedging the Groups exposure to foreign currency liabilities is recognised in the income statement within cost of sales.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price: the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current offer price.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash ows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Share-based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The fair value of the shares granted is recognised as an expense after taking into account the best estimate of the number of awards expected to vest.
The Group revisits the vesting estimate at each balance sheet date.
Non-market performance conditions are included in the vesting estimate.
Expenses are incurred over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured at the date of grant using whichever of the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo models, or closing market price is most appropriate to the award.
Market based performance conditions are included in the fair value measurement on grant date and are not revisited for actual performance.
Non-GAAP financial information Exceptional items Items which are both material and non-recurring are presented as exceptional items within their relevant income statement line.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of underlying performance of the Group.
Examples of items which may be recorded as exceptional items are impairment charges, restructuring costs and the profits losses on the disposal of businesses.
Benchmark measures The Group uses the following terms as measures which are not formally recognised under IFRS: Benchmar k operating profit is dened as operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, store impairment and onerous lease charges or releases, exceptional items and costs related to demerger incentive schemes.
Benchmar k profit before tax PBT is dened as profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles, store impairment and onerous lease charges or releases, exceptional items, costs related to demerger incentive schemes, nancing fair value remeasurements, nancing impact on retirement bene t obligations, the discount unwind on non-benchmark items and taxation.
B asic benchmark earnings per share benchmark EPS is dened as benchmark PBT less taxation attributable to benchmark PBT, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue excluding shares held in Home Retail Groups share trusts net of vested but unexercised share awards.
These measures are considered useful in that they provide investors with an alternative means to evaluate the underlying performance of the Groups operations.
Total net debt The Group uses the term total net debt which is considered useful in that it highlights the Groups aggregate net indebtedness to banks and other financial institutions together with debt-like liabilities, notably operating leases.
Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 67 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the financial statements continued For the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2011 4.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Financial risk factors There are a number of financial risks and uncertainties which could impact the performance of the Group: market risk foreign exchange and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group operates a structured risk management process which identies, evaluates and prioritises risks and uncertainties.
Further details of the principal risks and uncertainties that could impact the Groups performance, and the Groups mitigating activities, are set out in the principal risks and uncertainties section of the review of the business on pages 32 to 33.
The Groups treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to foreign exchange, interest rate and other financial risks, and to ensure suf cient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Policies and procedures are subject to review and approval by the Board of Directors as well as subject to internal audit review.
Market risk foreign exchange risk The Group is subject to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and the euro.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
To manage the foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, entities in the Group use forward contracts, transacted with external banks.
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the net position in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts.
The key objective of the Groups foreign exchange transaction exposure management is to minimise potential volatility in profits which could arise as a result of exchange rate uctuations whilst maintaining an appropriate relative position versus the Groups retail peers.
To achieve the above objectives, the Group will initially seek to hedge up to 90% of any foreign exchange transaction risks expected to arise as a result of uncertain, but probable, foreign currency cash ows up to 14 months forward.
This subsequently increases to 100% as cash ows become certain.
Each subsidiary designates contracts as fair value hedges or cash ow hedges, as appropriate.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specic assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The cash ow hedges are intended to hedge the foreign currency exposure of future purchases of inventory.
Weekly reports are made to management to demonstrate that this objective is being achieved.
The hedged cash ows are expected to occur up to 14 months into the future and will be transferred to the consolidated income statement or inventory carrying value as applicable.
The Group has foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Groups foreign operations is not hedged.
If on 26 February 2011, the last day of the financial year, sterling had been 5 cents, or approximately 3.1% 2010: approximately 3.3%, weaker stronger against the US dollar, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 0.4m lower higher 2010: 0.8m higher lower mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains arising on retranslation of US dollar denominated balances in subsidiary companies with a sterling functional currency.
Equity would have been 9.6m higher lower 2010: 13.6m higher lower, arising mainly from the revaluation of US dollar forward currency contracts.
If on 26 February 2011, the last day of the financial year, sterling had been 5 cents, or approximately 4.3% 2010: approximately 4.5%, weaker stronger against the euro, with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit would have been 6.4m lower higher 2010: 3.6m lower higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange losses gains on retranslation of sterling denominated cash balances in subsidiary companies with a euro functional currency.
Equity would have been 0.8m lower higher 2010: 2.0m higher lower, arising mainly from the revaluation of euro forward currency contracts net of foreign exchange gains or losses on retranslation of euro-denominated net assets held by subsidiary companies with a euro functional currency.
Market risk cash ow and fair value interest rate risk Whilst the Groups Financial Services business has gross instalment receivable balances on xed interest rates and oating rates, the Groups income and operating cash ows are still considered to be substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The Group currently holds a net cash position and has undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from the variance in market rate when deposits are made.
This risk is managed by combining overnight deposits with term deposits.
Interest rate risk also arises from any future long-term borrowings that it may incur.
Borrowings issued at xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The principal objective of the Groups interest rate risk management is to manage the trade-off between obtaining the most beneficial effective rates of interest whilst minimising the impact of interest rate volatility on profits before tax.
The aim will normally be to manage interest rate risks by achieving a ratio of between 30% and 70% of net debt xed rate.
68 Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS The Group had no borrowings at any point during the year.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of financial services products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Customers are credit scored using an external credit agency.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash, via major debit and credit cards or via in-house or third party operated financial products.
The Groups exposure to credit risk with regard to treasury transactions is managed by dealing only with major banks and financial institutions.
Dealing activity is closely controlled and counterparty positions are monitored on a regular basis.
Foreign exchange counterparty limits are set for each organisation on a scale based on credit rating and maturity period.
Group policy is that cash is only deposited with major banks and financial institutions that satisfy the Groups credit requirements.
These credit requirements are assessed by reference to published credit ratings and the extent of UK Government investment, and are applied in combination to determine both the maximum amount and the maximum duration of cash deposits.
A minimum credit rating of at least AAStandard & Poors or Aa3 Moodys is required, unless the UK Government has a significant investment, in which case a minimum credit rating of at least A Standard & Poors or A1 Moodys is required.
Each deposit made by the Group during the year was compliant with the policy that was effective at the date the deposit was made.
Where a term deposit has been made and the counterparty ratings have subsequently reduced, each relevant position has been reviewed and any decision to maintain a position until the normal maturity date has been approved by the Board.
The credit quality of financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to external credit ratings as follows: Cash and term deposits and current asset investments Cash and Current Bank and institution Bank and institution short-term asset rating at rating at cash deposits investments a transaction date 26 February 2011 Maturity date m m AAA AAA n a 159.3 AA AA 10 May 2011 50.0 A A 23 August 2011 50.0 159.3 100.0 a The current asset investments comprise two term cash deposits, one invested for an initial period of six months and the other for nine months.

Liquidity risk Home Retail Group manages its cash and committed borrowing facilities to maintain liquidity and funding exibility.
Liquidity is achieved through arranging funding ahead of requirements and maintaining sufficient undrawn committed facilities to meet short-term needs.
At 26 February 2011, the Group had an undrawn committed borrowing facility available of 700m, 685m of which does not expire until July 2013.
This facility includes a covenant related to adjusted benchmark earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rent.
It is in place to enable the Group to finance its working capital requirements and for general corporate purposes, should the need arise.
The Group has not drawn down on the facility and has been in compliance with the requirements of the covenant throughout the year.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and derivative financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows.

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group nances its operations through a combination of retained profits, property leases and borrowing facilities where necessary.
The Group has signi cant liabilities through its obligations to pay rents under property leases.
The Group, in common with the credit rating agencies, treats its lease liabilities as debt when evaluating financial risk and investment returns.
The Groups net debt varies signicantly throughout the year due to trading seasonality, and the position as at 26 February 2011 is set out in the analysis of net cash debt on page 59.
During the year the Company purchased for cancellation 64,000,000 of its own ordinary shares of 10p each in the open market at a total cost of 150.2m including commission and stamp duty.
Foreign currency The principal exchange rates used were as follows: Average Closing 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 26 February 27 February 26 February 27 February 2011 2010 2011 2010 US dollar 1.55 1.59 1.61 1.52 Euro 1.17 1.13 1.17 1.12 Fair value estimation IFRS 7 requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level of the following measurement hierarchy: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : and Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of business on the balance sheet date.
A market is regarded as active if quoted prices are readily and regularly available from an exchange, dealer, broker, industry group, pricing service, or regulatory agency, and those prices represent actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Group is the current bid price.
These instruments are included in level 1 and comprise investments in quoted managed indexed funds.
As at 26 February 2011, these instruments, which are classied as available-for-sale financial assets, had a carrying value of 15.2m 2010: 12.5m.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market for example, over-the-counter derivatives is determined by using valuation techniques.
The valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where it is available and rely as little as possible on entity specic estimates.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
As at 26 February 2011, the fair value of derivative instruments used for hedging purposes was a net liability of 28.0m 2010: 47.7m net asset.
If one or more of the significant inputs is not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
The Group has no level 3 instruments to disclose.
Specic valuation techniques used to value financial instruments include: Q uoted market prices: and T he fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date.

This is analysed below: 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 26 February 27 February 2011 2010 m m profit before tax 265.2 293.0 profit before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 74.3 82.0 Effects of: Benchmark: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 5.5 10.7 Differences in effective tax rates on overseas earnings 2.3 1.3 Benchmark tax expense 77.5 91.4 Non-benchmark: Tax charge credit on non-benchmark items 1.8 0.6 Tax credit in respect of prior years 5.4 7.6 Rate change impact 0.4 Total tax charge in income statement 74.3 83.2 Factors that may affect future tax charges In the foreseeable future, the Groups tax charge will continue to be inuenced by the prole of profits earned in the different tax jurisdictions within the UK and the Republic of Ireland.
The income tax expense for the year is based on the United Kingdom statutory rate of corporation tax for the period of 28.0% 2010: 28.0%.
Overseas tax is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.
The impact of the changes in statutory rates relates to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 28.0% to 27.0% from 1 April 2011, the substantively enacted rate, which differs from the recently announced rate of 26.0%.
This change has resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of the net deferred tax asset to reect the enacted rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.

This would make a total dividend for the year of 14.7p per share, amounting to 118.0m.
The proposed dividend has not been included as a liability at 26 February 2011 in accordance with IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date.
It will be paid on 20 July 2011 to shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 20 May 2011.
The Home Retail Group Employee Share Trust has waived its entitlement to dividends in the amount of 1.9m 2010: 2.7m.

The recoverable amount of each of the business segments is determined as being the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use.
These calculations use cash ow projections based on financial plans approved by management looking forward five years.
Cash ows are extrapolated using a long-term growth rate beyond the five-year plan period.
There are a significant number of inter-connected assumptions that underpin the value-in-use calculations, however the key assumptions, which management believes are appropriate for both retail businesses, are: a long-term growth rate of 2.5% 2010: 2.5%, which has been used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the five-year plan period: a post-tax discount rate of 8.5% 2010: 8.5%, which equates to a pre-tax rate of approximately 11.8% 2010: 11.8%, has been estimated taking account of the specic risks inherent within the Groups retail businesses and has been applied to the cash ow projections: and operating profits for the current year, of 219.0m for Argos 2010: 266.2m and 47.6m for Homebase 2010: 41.2m, have been adjusted into the plan period, incorporating assumptions in respect of sales growth, gross margin and operating costs.
As a result of the value-in-use calculations as at 26 February 2011 no impairment charge is required against the carrying value of either the Argos or Homebase goodwill.
Management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions detailed above would cause the carrying value of the Argos or Homebase business segments to exceed their recoverable amounts.

DEFERRED TAX 2011 2010 m m The movements on the net deferred tax account are as follows: At 28 February 2010 23.8 61.1 Income statement charge note 10 24.2 30.5 Rate change impact 0.4 Exchange differences 0.6 Tax credited charged to other comprehensive income 15.7 7.4 At 26 February 2011 14.9 23.8 The deferred tax amounts recognised are as follows: Deferred tax assets: Deferred tax asset to be recovered after more than one year 39.4 61.6 Deferred tax liabilities: Deferred tax liability to be settled after more than one year 24.5 37.8 Net deferred tax assets 14.9 23.8 Closing deferred tax has been calculated at the substantively enacted UK corporation tax rate of 27.0% 2010: 28.0%, which differs from the recently announced rate of 26.0%.
The effect of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28.0% to 27.0% is a reduction in the net deferred tax asset at the end of 2011 of 0.6m.
Of this 0.6m, 0.2m has been charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
From 1 April 2011 the UK corporation tax rate fell to 26.0%.
This had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The proposed reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax by 1% per year to 23.0% is expected to be enacted separately each year.
The impact of the future rate reductions on the net deferred tax asset are not material for each future year at the balance sheet date.
The Group will assess the impact of the reduction in rate in line with its accounting policy in respect of deferred tax at each balance sheet date.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes.
These can be analysed into three categories, being those rolled over from old GUS plc schemes as a result of the demerger from GUS on 11 October 2006, incentive schemes specically related to the demerger Demerger incentive schemes and new Home Retail Group plc schemes subsequent to the demerger.
Prior to the demerger, a number of Home Retail Group plc employees participated in old GUS plc share-based payment schemes.
As part of the demerger, some of these schemes had early vesting with vesting occurring prior to completion of the demerger, while others were modied by rolling them over to become Home Retail Group plc share-based payment schemes.
Specically, all executive share option schemes in operation following the demerger from GUS plc were rolled over from a GUS plc share option arrangement to a Home Retail Group plc arrangement.
Furthermore, certain share grant schemes namely the co-investment plan and the performance share plan which originally operated as GUS plc share grant schemes, were rolled over as Home Retail Group plc share grant schemes.
Under IFRS 2, these changes were treated as modications to the schemes and hence revalued as at the demerger date.
Summary of the total cost of share-based compensation in respect of ordinary shares in the Company 52 weeks 52 weeks ended ended 26 February 27 February 2011 2010 m m Share option awards 2.4 5.0 Share grant awards 9.5 15.4 Total expense recognised all equity-settled 11.9 20.4 The total share-based payments charge of 11.9m 2010: 20.4m includes nil 2010: 6.3m relating to demerger incentive schemes which, together with national insurance costs of nil 2010: 1.4m, total nil 2010: 7.7m, and are excluded from benchmark profit before tax.
Summary of share option and share award arrangements During the year ended 26 February 2011, Home Retail Group plc had a number of share option and share award arrangements for its employees, all of which are equity-settled.
Details of these arrangements are as follows: Rolled over from old GUS plc schemes Share options The 1998 approved and non-approved executive share option schemes.
Under these schemes, the exercise price of granted options was equal to the market price of the shares over the three dealing days preceding grant.
The options became exercisable three years from the grant date, subject to the Groups EPS compound annual growth exceeding compound annual retail price ination by 4% per annum over a continuous three-year period and the employee completing three years service.
The EPS growth target is not a market-based performance condition as dened by IFRS 2.
The options have a maximum term of 10 years from grant.
No new options have been granted under these schemes since demerger and all outstanding awards have vested.
Share awards The ex-GUS plc co-investment plan permitted the awards of matching shares to participants, conditional on the achievement of speci ed performance targets related to the benchmark operating profit of the Group.
The matching shares are a nil consideration option and have been classied as an award of shares because the nature of the award is the same.
The grant date was the start of the financial year in which performance was assessed, which was one year before the quantity of shares awarded was determined.
Awards made under this plan normally vest after a four-year period for nil consideration, and participants have a further two years to exercise their awards.
The underlying value of the award was known at grant date, subject to the outcome of the performance condition.
All awards under this plan have now vested or lapsed and have been distributed to participants where applicable.
92 Home Retail Group Annual Report 2011 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Demerger incentive schemes Share awards The re-investment plan is a three-part scheme running over three, four and five years, under which participants were awarded matching shares.
The percentage of the award distributed to participants is conditional upon continued service, ranking of total shareholder return relative to a comparator group and the achievement of specified performance targets related to the return on invested capital of the Group.
The total shareholder return performance condition is considered a market-based performance condition under IFRS 2.
Awards under this plan have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three-year period preceding valuation.
Awards under the first and second parts of this scheme, running over three and four years respectively, have vested and been exercised, and awards under the third part of this scheme will vest in October 2011.
The share incentive plan was a one-off free share grant to all employees at the time of the demerger.
The shares were acquired by a trust on behalf of participants and will normally be forfeited if a participants employment with the Group ceases within three years of the grant date.
All awards under this plan vested after this initial three-year period in November 2009 and participants are able to exercise their awards, however awards can be exercised free of tax a further two years after vesting.
The shares continue to be held by the trust until the awards are either exercised by participants or lapse.
New Home Retail Group plc schemes Share options The Home Retail Group plc Sharesave Plan permits the grant to employees of options over the Companys shares linked to a building society save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of between 5 and 250 per month.
Options are normally capable of being exercised at the end of the three or five-year period at an exercise price calculated at a 20% discount to market price over the three dealing days preceding invitation to participants.
Options must be exercised within six months of the end of the three or five-year save-as-you-earn contract.
Share awards The performance share plan.
Awards made under this plan will normally vest three years after the date of grant for nil consideration, with the percentage of the award distributed to participants determined either by ranking total shareholder return TSR relative to a comparator group or by reference to performance against specic EPS growth targets.
The TSR target is considered a market-based performance condition under IFRS 2, and the awards with this performance condition have been valued using a Monte Carlo simulation with historic volatilities and correlations measured over the three-year period preceding valuation.
The EPS growth target is a non market-based performance condition, and the awards with this performance condition have been valued by reference to the share price at the date of grant.
The co-investment plan permitted the awards of matching shares to participants.
Vesting is normally conditional on the achievement of speci ed performance targets in two stages.
The grant date was the start of the financial year in which the first performance stage the achievement of specified performance targets related to the benchmark operating profit of the Group was assessed, which was one year before the quantity of shares awarded is determined.
No new awards were granted under this plan during the year.
The deferred bonus plan permits the award of a deferred bonus that will be converted into a conditional award of shares and operated for the year ended 27 February 2010 only.
The award was based on performance against a benchmark PBT and a Group net cash target and was made at the maximum: 150% of salary in May 2010.
The grant date is the start of the financial year in which the performance stage is assessed, which is one year before the shares are awarded.
Subject to continued employment the shares will vest and be released on a phased basis, for nil consideration.
1 6 will vest on the first anniversary of the award, 2 6 on the second and 3 6 on the third anniversary.
The deferred share plan is a discretionary award of deferred shares.
This award has no performance conditions, other than a level of personal performance.
Awards made under this plan vest on a phased basis for nil consideration: being 1 6 one year after the award is made, 2 6 two years after the award is made and 3 6 three years after the award is made.
The executive directors did not participate in this plan.
