Subject to the foregoing, there were no further significant restrictions on any of the Companys subsidiaries in paying dividends or repaying loans and advances.
All regulated banking and insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain capital at levels agreed with the regulators: this may impact those subsidiaries ability to make distributions.
