Earnings loss per share Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue after deducting the groups shares held by employee share ownership trusts and treasury shares.
In calculating the diluted earnings loss per share, share options outstanding and other potential shares have been taken into account where the impact of these is dilutive.
Options over 81m shares 2010: 138m shares, 2009: 158m shares were excluded from the calculation of the total diluted number of shares as the impact of these is antidilutive.
