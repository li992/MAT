Under the EIP, the Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share-settled stock appreciation rights SARs and Performance shares.
No price is payable on the grant of an award.
In normal circumstances, EIP awards vest three years following the date of grant provided the relevant performance conditions have been met.
For share options and SARs, the performance conditions relate to the Companys earnings per share EPS.
For Performance share awards made prior to 2011, performance conditions relate to Total Shareholder Return TSR.
For awards made in 2011, performance conditions relate to the Companys EPS and TSR.
Further information on the performance conditions for EIP share incentives is set out in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 49 to 50.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.

Employee share plans continued Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP is now closed for new awards and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan was primarily targeted at US employees with grants normally determined by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Grants were also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Under the SSIP, the Company was able to grant share options and share-settled SARs.
No price was payable on the grant of an award.
Most awards made pursuant to the SSIP vest over four years, provided that the participant remains in employment.
Vesting is not normally subject to a performance condition and awards become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal tranches on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of the date of grant will lapse.
The vesting of SSIP awards made to Bill Burns prior to his appointment as Chief Executive Officer and to certain other key senior managers within the Communications group, were subject to the Company meeting EPS growth targets over the vesting periods.
All outstanding awards have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the seventh anniversary of their respective grant dates.
SARs granted under the EIP and SSIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the increase in market value of an Ordinary Share over the base price of the SAR in the form of Ordinary Shares.
This SARs approach helps the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain needs to be funded.
Using a SARs approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
At 31 December 2011, 0.9 million EIP SARs and 7.3 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 91 pence and 51 pence respectively were outstanding 2010 0.5 million EIP SARs and 11.0 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 50 pence and 55 pence respectively.
During 2011, 3.6 million EIP and SSIP SARs were exercised resulting in the issue or transfer of 2.1 million Ordinary Shares 2010 4.0 million Ordinary Shares were issued on the exercise of 7.3 million EIP and SSIP SARs.
1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed for new grants and has been replaced by the EIP referred to above.
Under the ESOS awards of share options, including HMRC approved options, were on a discretionary basis.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS were subject to the achievement of an EPS performance condition before they could be exercised.
All outstanding options have now passed their EPS performance conditions and remain exercisable until they expire on the tenth anniversary of their respective grant dates.
Acquisition plans Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary Shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
At 31 December 2011 there are no remaining outstanding NARSOP options and the plan is therefore closed.
Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary Shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in 2000, approximately 3.8 million Ordinary Shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary Shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
At 31 December 2011 there are no remaining outstanding ZARSOP options and the plan is therefore closed.
97 spirent communications plc annual report 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28.
Employee share plans continued Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary Shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares vested over a period ending in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
The options have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
No further awards can be made under this plan.
The Ordinary Shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count towards ABI scheme limits.
All Employee plans UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market closing price of an Ordinary Share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary Shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, no Ordinary Shares were transferred to participants 2010 0.1 million Ordinary Shares.
No invitations have been made under either of these schemes since 2003 and there are no options outstanding at 31 December 2011 2010 nil.
US Employee Stock Purchase Plan US ESPP The US ESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2000, with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The US ESPP enables the Company to invite all US employees to acquire shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In November 2010, the Company commenced making six-monthly invitations to employees.
The US ESPP also enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent Ordinary Shares using the proceeds of a savings contract.
If such a grant were made, when joining the US ESPP, participants would enter into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit of $1,000 per month.
No grants of this nature have been made since 2003.
Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was initially approved by shareholders in 2001 with amendments being approved by shareholders in 2005 and 2011.
The GAESPP enables the Company to invite employees in countries other than the US or UK to acquire shares in the Company on market using deductions from payroll.
In September 2011, such an invitation was made to all employees in Canada, Hong Kong, France and Germany.
The GAESPP can also be operated on similar terms to the US ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of base salary subject to an individual limit.
