Segmental information The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for reviewing the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and the allocation of resources.
The Groups properties, which are all located in Londons West End, are managed as a single portfolio.
Its properties, which are of similar type, are combined into villages.
All of the villages are geographically close to each other and have similar economic features and risks.
For the purposes of IFRS 8, each village is considered to be a separate operating segment.
However, in view of the similar characteristics of each village, and the reporting of all investment, income and expenditure to the Board at an overall Group level, the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 have been applied to give one reportable operating segment.
The Board assesses the performance of the reportable operating segment using measures of net property income and investment property valuation.
All financial information provided to the Board is prepared on a basis consistent with these financial statements and, as the Group has only one reportable segment, the reconciliation of the measures used in assessing the business to the reported results are set out in the Group Statement of Comprehensive Income.

Earnings per share In October 2010, EPRA issued their updated Best Practice Recommendations.
The aim is to improve comparability between European property companies by providing a universal measure of underlying business performance.
The calculations below are in accordance with EPRAs Best Practice Recommendations.

There is no material difference to the figures previously disclosed.
The difference between the weighted average and diluted average number of Ordinary shares arises from the potentially dilutive effect of outstanding options granted over Ordinary shares.

The extent to which the fair value deficit will crystallise will depend on the course of interest rates over the life of the swaps, which had a weighted average maturity of 21.4 years 2010: 22.4 years at the Balance Sheet date.

C. Rathbone Associates Limited at 302 basis points 2010: 217 basis points above the yield to redemption of the 5% Treasury Stock 2025 at the Balance Sheet date.
The Company is not obliged to redeem the 61.0 million nominal of Stock in issue in advance of its redemption date of 31 March 2024, when repayment will be at par value.
Other financial instruments The fair values of the Groups and Companys cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, interest bearing borrowings other than the 8.5% Mortgage Debenture Stock 2024, head leases and trade and other payables are not materially different from the values at which they are carried in the financial statements.
Cash outflows attributable to financial instruments and interest-bearing borrowings Group The tables below summarise the Groups undiscounted contractual cash flows arising on financial instruments and financial liabilities based on conditions existing at the Balance Sheet date.
Management of financial risk Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on their contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the creditworthiness of potential tenants prior to entering into contractual arrangements.
Where appropriate, tenants are required to provide cash rental deposits to mitigate the potential loss in the event of default.
Deposits held are referred to in note 15.
The Group has a large and diverse tenant base so that tenant credit risk is widely spread.
Provision is made in full where recovery of financial assets is, in the opinion of the Directors, uncertain.
The carrying amount of financial assets, net of provisions for impairment, represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Groups bankers are set out on page 43.
The Group holds minimal cash balances, utilising overdraft and loan facilities for its day-to-day cash requirements.
Where cash deposits are held, they are placed with one of the Groups existing facility providers.
Liquidity risk The Board keeps under review the Groups funding requirements, available facilities and covenant compliance to ensure it has sufficient funds available to meet its existing commitments and to extend its portfolio through investment and acquisition of additional properties.
The Groups policies regarding finance and its current financial position are set out in the Business Review on pages 25 to 28.

Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest bearing financial instruments, and is the risk that future cash flows from financial instruments will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and credit costs.
The Groups policy is to minimise market risk through long term fixed rate debt, long term committed bank facilities and the use of long term interest rate swaps on a large portion of its floating rate bank debt.
As described in the Business Review on pages 25 to 28, the Board keeps under review the Groups market risk, particularly in light of expectations of future interest rate movements.
The Groups First Mortgage Debenture Stock carries a rate of interest of 8.5%, which is fixed until maturity in March 2024.
The Groups current bank facilities, which expire between April 2016 and March 2021, are at credit margins which are fixed for the life of the facilities.
At 30 September 2011, the actual average credit margin on the amounts drawn under those facilities was 0.85% 2010: 0.76%.
If those facilities had been fully drawn at that date, the average credit margin payable would have been 1.04% 2010: 0.81%.
The Group has in place interest rate swaps to hedge 360.0 million of floating rate bank debt, at fixed rates in the range 4.59% to 5.15%, with a weighted average rate at 30 September 2011 of 4.87%.
The swaps, which are settled against three month LIBOR, expire between December 2027 and November 2038 weighted average term 21.4 years.

Management of financial risk continued Interest rate sensitivity Based on indebtedness, interest rates and hedging in place at the year end, the impact of a change of 0.5% in market interest rates applicable to its LIBOR-linked borrowings and swaps and a change of 0.5% in the long term interest rates against which the fair value of swaps is calculated, would have the following impacts on the Groups results and equity: Movement in market rates Increase Reduction of 0.5% of 0.5% m m Increase decrease in finance costs before fair valuation of interest rate swaps 0.4 0.4 Decrease increase in fair value deficit of interest rate swaps 28.9 28.9 Increase decrease in profit and shareholders equity 28.5 28.5 This sensitivity analysis does not take into account valuation movements on the Groups investment properties as a result of movements in long term interest rates, which would be reflected in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, to provide returns to shareholders and to maintain an appropriate capital structure to minimise the cost of capital.
The current capital structure of the Group comprises a mix of equity and debt.
Equity comprises issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in the Group Balance Sheet.
Debt comprises long-term secured bank loans, Debenture Stock and head lease liabilities.

Options over 183,717 Ordinary shares will lapse.
Reserves The Statement of Changes in Shareholders Equity is set out on page 67.
The following describes the nature and purpose of each of the reserves within shareholders equity.
Reserve Description and purpose Merger reserve The merger reserve is used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 2006.
Share premium Share premium is the amount by which the fair value of the consideration received from Ordinary shares exceeds the nominal value of shares issued, net of expenses.
Share based payments reserve The share based payment expense charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income is credited to the share based payments reserve over the vesting period of performance-based shares options.
Upon exercise of options, the expense previously recognised is transferred to retained earnings.
Retained earnings Cumulative gains and losses recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Transfers from the share based payments reserve and merger reserve are also credited this account.
The merger reserve that arose during the year was as a result of the Share Placing in March 2011.
No share premium is recognised in the Companys financial statements as the issue was subject to the Merger Relief provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The subsequent redemption of the these shares meant that 96.5 million of distributable profits were transferred to retained earnings.
The Company made a loss of 1.3 million 2010: loss 12.1 million in the year.
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no Statement of Comprehensive Income has been presented for the Company.
The Companys retained earnings at 30 September 2011 include amounts distributable of 250.1 million 2010: 157.9 million.

Share based remuneration The fair value of option grants is measured by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, Actuaries & Consultants, using a combination of Monte Carlo simulation and modified binomial models, and taking into account the terms and conditions upon which awards were granted.
The fair value is recognised over the expected vesting period.
For the grants made during the year, the main inputs and assumptions of the models, and the resulting fair values, are as follows: LTIP Grant date 8 December 2010 Share price at date of grant 4.301 Exercise price Nil Expected life years 3 Performance condition NAV and TSR Assumed return volatility per annum 37.0% Assumed dividend yield per annum 2.4% Risk free discount rate per annum 1.5% Assumed return volatility of FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index per annum: TSR performance condition 34.0% Assumed statistical correlation between the total return on the Companys shares and those in the FTSE 350 Super Sector Real Estate Index: TSR performance condition 78.0% Basis of option pricing: NAV performance condition Modified binomial TSR performance condition Monte Carlo simulation Fair values: NAV 4.01 TSR 2.02 The assumed volatility was determined taking into account factors including the historical volatility of the Shaftesbury PLC share price.
Actual future volatility may differ, potentially significantly, from historic volatility.
The vesting conditions relating to options granted under the LTIP are described in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 50.
