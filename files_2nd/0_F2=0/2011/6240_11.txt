Based on proven and Tocompensate for this effect and maximise the full potential probable reserves and current milling capacity, the expected life ofthemine, we increased production at lower grade stopes.

The construction of the Jarillas shaft remained on schedule forstart-up in 2H 2012.
This new shaft will have a 5,000 tonnes perdaycapacity and will reduce haulage and hoisting costs attheSaucito mine.
Notwithstanding strong production results, there were three fatalities at Saucito in 2011 due to improper adherence to safety procedures, and the mine experienced higher than average personnel turnover in the year related to the perceived external security situation.
The employee retention rate improved as the Company enhanced its security measures over the course of the year, which also helped strengthen safety performance given the correlation between tenure and participation in safety training.
