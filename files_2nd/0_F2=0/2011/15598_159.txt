SUMMARY FINANCIAL STATEMENT Group financials Group sales, including VAT, increased by 8.1% to 67.6 billion.
At constant Group Return on Capital Employed ROCE increased substantially exchange rates, sales increased by 6.6% including petrol and 6.0% to 12.9% last year 12.1%.
We expect to deliver our target increase of excluding petrol.
This increase will be driven predominantly by operational Group trading profit was 3,679 million, up 7.8% on last year and Group improvement growth in asset turnover and margin combined with trading margin, at 6.0%, increased by 4 basis points.
Underlying profit improved capital efficiency work in progress release and our property before tax rose to 3,813 million, an increase of 12.3%.
By geography and business segment, the increases in underlying profit before tax grew by 12.2%.
On a statutory basis, Group ROCE will be broadly based, coming from Asia, Europe, the US, the operating profit rose by 10.2% to 3,811 million.
Group profit before UK and Tesco Bank.
The Board has proposed a final dividend of 10.09p per share, taking Net finance costs increased to 333 million 314 million last year.
This represents an increase of 10.8% However, before the non-cash IAS 19, 32, and 39 adjustments, actual net on last years full-year dividend, which is in line with the growth in interest cost fell by 83 million to 334 million.
This reflects the continued underlying diluted earnings per share at constant tax rates.
It is also the reduction in net debt.
27th consecutive year of dividend increase.
The final dividend will be paid on 8 July 2011 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close Total Group tax has been charged at an effective rate of 24.4% last year of business on 3 May 2011.
This reduction was largely driven by a reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax, and a lower Japan impairment than last year.
We expect the tax rate for 2011 12 to be broadly unchanged.
EBITDAR defined as statutory profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation Cash Flow and Balance Sheet.
Net debt reduced to 6.8 billion, ahead and rent.
of our target of 7.0 billion, helped by strong cash generation in the seasonally important second half of the year.
During the year, we repaid 926 million of our debt early and repaid 777 million of maturing bonds.
The strength of our property-backed balance sheet was again demonstrated through continued strong investor demand for our property sale and leaseback transactions during the year.
We expect net debt to fall further in the years ahead.
Looking at our liabilities in the round, we will be focusing more on fixed charge cover as our primary balance sheet metric, which we are targeting to keep between 4 and 4.5 times.
We also are targeting a ratio of 2.5 times lease-adjusted net debt to EBITDAR which represents a similar level to where we were prior to the Homever and TPF acquisitions.
Group capital expenditure in the year was 3.7 billion last year 3.1 billion, a little higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year, mainly as a result of exchange rate movements.
Capital expenditure in the UK was 1.7 billion, with an additional 0.2 billion in the Bank, principally for the re-platforming of our systems, and 1.8 billion in International.
For the 2011 12 year we plan to invest around 4.0 billion in capital expenditure and going forward we expect annual capital expenditure to total between 5% and 5.5% of Group sales.
