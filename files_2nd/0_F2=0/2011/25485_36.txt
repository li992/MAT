The authority will be exercised only if the directors of Investec plc believe that to do so would result in an increase of earnings per ordinary share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally or, in the case of the creation of treasury shares, that to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.
In order for special resolution no.
5 to be given effect, a 75% seventy five per cent majority of the votes of all shareholders present or represented by proxy at the annual general meeting of Investec plc and Investec Limited must be cast in favour of special resolution no.

The directors of Investec plc consider it may, in certain circumstances, be in the best interests of shareholders generally for Investec plc to purchase its own preference shares.
6 is to grant a general authority, subject to the speci ed limits, to Investec plc to acquire preference shares of Investec plc.
The Companies Act 2006 permits Investec plc to purchase its own preference shares to be held in treasury, with a view to possible resale at a future date.
If Investec plc were to purchase preference shares under the Companies Act 2006 they will be cancelled or, to the extent determined by the directors of Investec plc, held in treasury.
The authority will be exercised only if the directors of Investec plc believe that to do so would be in the interests of shareholders generally or, in the case of the creation of treasury shares, that to do so would be in the best interests of shareholders generally.

Ordinary resolution: Investec plc: Political donations Resolved that: in accordance with section 366 of the Companies Act 2006, Investec plc and any company which, at any time during the period for which this resolution has effect, is a subsidiary of Investec plc, be and are hereby authorised to: i make donations to political organisations not exceeding 25 000 twenty five thousand Pounds Sterling in total and ii incur political expenditur e not exceeding 75 000 seventy five thousand Pounds Sterling in total.
In each case during the period commencing on the date of this resolution and ending on the date of the annual general meeting of Investec plc to be held in 2012, provided that the maximum amounts referred to in i and ii may consist of sums in any currency converted into Pounds Sterling at such rate as Investec plc may in its absolute discretion determine.
For the purposes of this resolution, the terms political donations, political organisations and political expenditure shall have the meanings given to them in sections 363 to 365 of the Companies Act 2006.
The reason for ordinary resolution no.
43 is that the Companies Act 2006 requires companies to obtain shareholder approval before they can make donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure.
Investec plc does not give any money for political purposes in the UK nor does it make any donations to EU political organisations or incur EU political expenditure.
However, the fide nitions of political donations and political expenditure used in the Companies Act 2006 are very wide.
The authority is a precautionary measure to ensure that Investec plc does not inadvertently breach the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The directors of Investec plc consider that the proposed resolutions in the notice of the annual general meeting are in the best interests of Investec plc and its shareholders and recommends that you vote in favour as the directors of Investec plc intend to do in respect of their own bene cial holdings.
