The time value of options and guarantees is calculated for a new 65 year old Male CPA annuitant is 24.2 years 31 using economic and non-economic assumptions December 2010: 24.3 years.
The expectation of life on the consistent with those used for the deterministic embedded regulatory reserving basis is 25.8 years 31 December 2010: value calculations.
This section describes the models used to generate future v. Development costs relate to investment in strategic systems investment simulations, and gives some sample statistics and development capability that are charged to the covered for the simulations used.
A single model has been used business.
Projects charged to the non-covered business for UK and international business, with different economic are included within Investment projects in Group capital assumptions for each territory.
Government nominal interest rates are generated using International a LIBOR Market Model projecting full yield curves at annual vi.
The model provides a good t to the initial yield curve.
The total annual returns on equities and property are LGA calculated as the return on 1 year bonds plus an excess Reinvestment rate 4.2 5.5 5.1 return.
The excess return is assumed to have a lognormal 1 Risk free rate 1.9 3.3 3.9 distribution.
Corporate bonds are modelled separately by Risk margin 3.7 3.3 3.5 credit rating using stochastic credit spreads over the risk free Risk discount rate net of tax 5.6 6.6 7.4 rates, transition matrices and default recovery rates.
The real yield curve model assumes that the real short rate follows a Europe 1 mean-reverting process subject to two normally distributed Risk free rate 2.6 3.2 3.6 random shocks.

Other actuarial assumptions have been set at levels bonds of various durations: and commensurate with recent operating experience, I nternational business xed rate bonds including those for mortality, morbidity, persistency of various durations.
The profits on the covered business, except for the profits on the Society shareholder capital held outside the long term fund, are calculated on an after tax basis and are grossed up by the notional attributed tax rate for presentation in the income statement.
For the UK, the after tax basis assumes the annualised current tax rate of 26.5% and the subsequent planned future reductions in corporation tax to 25% from 1 April 2012, 24% from 1 April 2013, and 23% from 1 April 2014 previously a single tax rate was used: 31 December 2010: 27%.
The tax rate used for grossing up is the long term corporate tax rate in the territory concerned, which for the UK is 23% 31 December 2010: 27% taking into account the expected further rate reductions to 23% by 1 April 2014.
Theprots on the Society shareholder capital held outside the long term fund are calculated before tax and therefore tax is calculated on an actual basis.
