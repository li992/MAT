Taxation Man is a global business and therefore operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are allocated to these different jurisdictions based on transfer pricing methodologies which are agreed with the relevant authorities.
The effective tax rate results from the combination of taxes paid on earnings attributable to the tax jurisdictions in which they arise.
The majority of the Groups profit continues to be earned in Switzerland and in the UK and the current effective tax rate of 15.7% 2010: 17.7% is consistent with this earnings profile.
Further analysis is given in AFI 6.
The effective tax rate on adjusted profits Note 9 is 14.2% 2010: 18.6%.
The lower rate is principally the result of prior year adjustments from the settlement of tax returns as well as a reduction in the closing UK deferred tax liability, following the reduction in the UK Corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% AFI Note 6.
Earnings per ordinary share EPS The calculation of basic EPS is based on a basic post tax earnings for the year of $187 million 2010: $421 million and ordinary shares of 1,749,928,034 2010: 1,678,121,503, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year after excluding the shares owned by the Man employee trusts.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Adjusted net income for adjusted basic and adjusted diluted EPS, together with details of the adjusted diluted and basic EPS is given in AFI 8.
Segmental analysis The criteria for identifying an operating segment is that it is a component of Man whose results are regularly reviewed by the Executive Committee to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance.
Management information regarding revenues, gross management fee margins, investment performance and distribution costs relevant to the operation of the investment managers, products and the investor base are reviewed by the Executive Committee.
A centralised shared infrastructure for operations, products structuring and distribution means that operating costs are not and cannot meaningfully be allocated to constituent parts of the investment management businesses.
As a result, resources are allocated and performance is assessed by the Executive Committee on the basis of the investment management business of Man as a whole.
Accordingly we operate and report as a single segment investment management business, together with relevant information regarding FUM flows, gross margins, and distribution costs to allow for the analysis of the direct contribution of products and the respective investor base.
Geographical disclosures are given in AFI 9.
