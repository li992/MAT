58 Man Group plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Review continued 2.
Funds under management FUM unaudited The growth in FUM is a key indicator of our performance as an investment manager and our ability to remain competitive and build a sustainable business.
Average FUM multiplied by our fee margin equates to our revenue earning capacity.
Our objective is therefore to grow funds under management while maintaining our fee margin.
Funds under management are shown by product groupings that have similar margin and investor characteristics.
The GLG FUM and FUM movements are included from the acquisition date 14 October 2010.
FUM, fund flows and margins are discussed further in Section 4 and AFI 3.

Open ended alternative FUM increased by 113% during the year due to the acquisition of GLG and net inflows following strong demand for alternative formats and positive fund performance in both AHL and GLG.
The FUM of $27.3 billion at the year-end comprised $13.7 billion from AHL open-ended products and $13.6 billion from GLG alternatives.
Institutional FUM remained broadly flat during the year with net outflows being offset by positive FX movements related to the strengthening of the Euro.
63% of Institutional FUM is denominated in non USD currencies.
GLG long only FUM increased by 6% post acquisition driven by strong fund performance.
Margins The management fee margin is calculated as revenue divided by average FUM.
Previously the share of management fees from associates, primarily from BlueCrest, were included in the gross management fee margin.
The sale of the interest in BlueCrest in March 2011 will result in lower associate income in future periods, therefore in the analysis of management fee margins in the table below we have excluded income from associates for all periods.
Gross management fee margins by product channel are shown in the table below.
FY 2011 FY FY 2010 FY Average FUM revenue Margin Average FUM revenue Margin $bn $m bp $bn $m bp Average FUM Total 52.4 1,452 277 42.6 1,293 304 Guaranteed 470 463 AHL open ended 360 356 GLG alternatives 156 155 Institutional 115 93 Long only 75 83 The guaranteed products gross management and other fees margin was 470 bp 2010: 463 bp.
The small increase is primarily the result of higher redemption fee income received, mainly in the first half of the year.
Margins on recent guaranteed products are consistent with historical levels.
The AHL gross management and other fees margin on open-ended products was 360 bp, broadly the same as in 2010.
The GLG alternatives gross management and other fees margin was 156 bp, compared to 155 bp for 2010 based on GLG average margins for the period from 1 October 2009 to 31 March 2010.
An increase in the net flows and investment performance of higher yielding funds being broadly offset by inflows and investment performance into lower yielding managed accounts.
Institutional gross management and other fees margin was 115 bp, compared to 93 bp for 2010.
The primary reason for the increase relates to additional management fees earned following the achievement of net asset thresholds in certain Pemba funds.
Margins on institutional products are expected to reduce as a result of a mix shift towards managed account mandates which have an average margin of 50 bp.
Long only gross management and other fees margin was 75 bp, compared to 83 bp for 2010.
The primary reason for the decrease is due to material inflows of lower yielding institutional mandates.
