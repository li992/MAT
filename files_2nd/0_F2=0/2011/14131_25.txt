Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 79 15 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Severn Trent Employee Share Ownership Trust, which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations are calculated on the basis of profit from continuing operations attributable to the equity holders of the company.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data: Earnings 2011 2010 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from operations Profit for the period attributable to the equity holders of the company 272.6 249.2 Number of shares 2011 2010 m m Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of basic earnings per share 236.7 236.0 Effect of dilutive potential ordinary shares - share options and LTIPs 1.1 0.3 Weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purpose of diluted earnings per share 237.8 236.3 Adjusted earnings per share 2011 2010 pence pence Adjusted basic earnings per share 105.6 122.8 Adjusted diluted earnings per share 105.1 122.6 Adjusted earnings per share figures are presented for continuing operations.
These exclude the effects of deferred tax, losses gains on financial instruments and exceptional items in both 2011 and 2010.
The directors consider that the adjusted figures provide a useful additional indicator of performance.
The denominators used in the calculations of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share are the same as those used in the unadjusted figures set out above.
The adjustments to earnings are as follows: Adjustments to earnings 2011 2010 m m Earnings for the purpose of basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 272.6 249.2 Adjustments for - exceptional items 21.4 49.7 - current tax related to exceptional items at 28% 2010: 28% 4.7 5.6 - losses gains on financial instruments 14.2 45.7 - deferred tax 53.6 42.2 Earnings for the purpose of adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share 249.9 289.8 Financial statements 80 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2011 16 Goodwill 2011 2010 m m Cost and net book value At 1 April 70.6 63.3 Additions 10.3 Amounts written off 0.2 Exchange adjustments 2.3 2.8 At 31 March 68.3 70.6 Goodwill impairment tests Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units CGUs identified according to country of operation and business segment.

These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five year period.
The key assumption underlying these budgets is revenue growth.
Assumptions are determined by management of each CGU based on past experience, current market trends and expectations of future developments.
Cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using an estimated nominal growth rate stated below.
The growth rate does not exceed the long term average growth rate for the economy in which the CGU operates.
The assumptions used in relation to growth rates beyond the five year period and discount rates were: Nominal growth rate Discount rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % % % Water Purification US 3.0 3.0 7.3 7.8 Contract Operations 3.0 3.0 7.7 8.9 UK Laboratories 3.0 3.0 7.3 8.9 Services Italy 3.0 3.0 11.0 10.1 Apliclor 3.0 3.0 11.6 10.0 The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the CGU.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 81 16 Goodwill continued Changes in the growth rate outside the five year period or in the discount rate applied to the cash flows may cause a CGUs carrying value to exceed its recoverable amount.
Where such a change is considered reasonably possible, the amount by which the recoverable amount exceeded its carrying value, and the amount by which the growth rate and discount rate would have to change, is set out below for each CGU.

The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out on behalf of the trustees at triennial intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
Under the 1 1 defined benefit schemes, members are entitled to retirement benefits calculated as a proportion varying between and for 30 80 each year of service of their salary for the final year of employment with the group or, if higher, the average of the highest three consecutive years salary in the last ten years of employment.
The final salary sections of all of the pension schemes listed below are closed to new entrants and the age profile of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
On 11 May 2011, Severn Trent announced it is consulting with its 6,000 plus UK employees on proposed changes to its pension arrangements, which would see all existing pensions replaced by one new defined contribution scheme.
Under the new proposals, the group would close its defined benefit scheme to future accrual, whilst protecting the benefits already built up by members.
The UK defined benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Pension scheme STPS 31 March 2007 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2009 The STPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes.
The group has an obligation to pay pensions to a number of former employees, whose benefits would otherwise have been restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision for such benefits amounting to 8.1 million 2010: 7.6 million is included as an unfunded scheme within the retirement benefit obligation.
iv Actuarial assumptions The major assumptions used in the valuation of the STPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the valuations of all group schemes were as follows: 2011 2010 % % Price inflation 3.50 3.60 Salary increases 4.00 4.10 Pension increases in payment 3.50 3.60 Pension increases in deferment 3.50 3.60 Discount rate 5.60 5.70 Long term rate of return on Equities 7.85 8.00 Gilts 4.35 4.50 Corporate bonds 5.60 5.70 Property 6.85 7.00 Cash 4.25 4.50 The assumption for price inflation is derived from the difference between the yields on longer term fixed rate gilts and on index-linked gilts.
The discount rate is set by reference to AA rated sterling corporate 17 year bonds.
The expected rate of return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the life of the benefit obligation.
For gilts and corporate bonds the expected rates of return are based on market yields.
For equities, an equity risk premium has been added to the gilt rate.
The mortality assumptions adopted are based on mortality tables applicable to the sex and year of birth of individual members, with allowance for the CMI 2010 future improvements and a 0.5% trend.
For men the assumptions are based on 110% of the SAPS S1NMA L tables and for women on 78% of the S1NFA L tables.
These have been based on a mortality investigation carried out in conjunction with the valuation of the STPS as at 31 March 2010 on behalf of the Trustees.
The life expectancies implied by the mortality assumptions adopted at each year end are as follows: Years Years Age to which current pensioners aged 65 are expected to live - men 87.4 85.3 - women 91.0 88.6 Age to which future pensioners aged 45 at the balance sheet date are expected to live - men 88.0 86.5 - women 91.8 89.6 Financial statements 90 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2011 27 Retirement benefit schemes continued iv Actuarial assumptions continued The calculation of the scheme liabilities is sensitive to the actuarial assumptions and in particular to the assumptions relating to discount rate, price inflation and mortality.
The following table summarises the estimated impact on scheme liabilities and service cost resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
Assumption Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate Increase decrease by 0.1% Decrease increase by 30 million Price inflation Increase decrease by 0.1% Increase decrease by 25 million Mortality Increase in life expectancy by 1 year Increase by 45 million v Contributions to the schemes Contribution rates are set in consultation with the trustees for each scheme and each participating employer.
The triennial actuarial valuation of the STPS is currently under discussion with the trustees.
It is therefore not possible to determine the level of contributions that will be payable in the year ending 31 March 2012. vi History of actual and expected performance of pension scheme assets and liabilities 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 m m m m m Present value of defined benefit obligations 1,765.5 1,747.9 1,308.0 1,458.3 1,499.7 Fair value of scheme assets 1,473.4 1,393.0 1,075.0 1,332.3 1,364.6 Deficit in schemes 292.1 354.9 233.0 126.0 135.1 Difference between actual and expected return on scheme assets 12.2 270.4 329.8 125.7 10.6 Experience adjustments on scheme liabilities 105.1 19.8 7.9 64.3 3.7 b Defined contribution schemes The group also operates defined contribution arrangements for certain of its UK and overseas employees.

Discount rates are derived from yield curves based on quoted interest rates and are adjusted for the groups credit risk.
Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the application of yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Cross currency swaps and forward exchange contracts are valued by reference to quoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the contracts.

The groups overall risk management programme addresses the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce potential adverse effects on the groups financial performance or position.
Financial risks are managed by a central treasury department Group Treasury under policies approved by the board of directors.
Group Treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with the groups operating units.
The board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas such as exchange rate risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of derivative and non-derivative financial instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to changes in exchange rates and interest rates.
The groups policy is that derivative financial instruments are not held for trading.
Financial statements 96 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2011 32 Financial instruments continued f Financial risk factors continued i Market risk The principal market risk that the group is exposed to is fluctuations in interest rates.
Since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water, which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
Interest rate risk The groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
The groups interest rate risk arises from long term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group policy is to maintain 45-90% of its net debt in fixed rate instruments.
The group manages its cash flow interest rate risk by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rates to fixed rates.
Under the terms of the interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, mainly semi-annually, the difference between fixed contract and floating rate interest rates calculated by reference to the agreed notional principal amounts.
The group has entered into a series of long dated interest rate swaps to hedge future debt.
Economically these act to fix debt within the group which is denominated as floating rate, but do not achieve hedge accounting under the strict criteria of IAS 39.
This has led to a 15.7 million charge 2010: credit of 41.9 million in the income statement.
Some of the groups debt is index-linked, that is its cost is linked to changes in the Retail Price Index RPI.
This debt provides an economic hedge for Severn Trent Waters revenues and Regulatory Capital Value that are also RPI linked under its regulatory regime.

However, since substantially all of the groups profits and net assets arise from Severn Trent Water which has very limited and indirect exposure to changes in exchange rates, the sensitivity of the groups results to changes in exchange rates is not material.
The group has a significant value of foreign currency debt, primarily in yen and euros.
The groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange risk arising from foreign currency debt by entering into cross currency swaps, or forward contracts with external parties.
At 31 March 2011 the group had cross currency swaps or forward contracts in place for all foreign currency denominated debt 2010: 100%.

Exchange risks relating to such operations are managed centrally by Group Treasury through forward exchange contracts to buy or sell currency.
External foreign exchange contracts are designated at group level as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.

ii Credit risk Operationally the group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history, other than in Severn Trent Water Limited, whose operating licence obliges it to supply domestic customers even in cases where bills are not paid.
Amounts provided against accounts receivable and movements on the provision during the year are disclosed in note 22.
For financing purpose, derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Credit risk analysis At 31 March the credit limits and the amounts held on short term deposits were as follows: Credit limit Amount deposited 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m AAA 300.0 300.0 54.8 35.5 Double A range 450.0 450.0 81.2 89.6 Single A range 525.0 525.0 112.6 58.6 1,275.0 1,275.0 248.6 183.7 The amounts of derivative assets analysed by credit ratings of counterparties were as follows: Financial assets 2011 2010 Rating m m Double A range 100.9 90.8 Single A range 91.5 115.9 192.4 206.7 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 99 32 Financial instruments continued f Financial risk factors continued iii Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity management implies maintaining sufficient cash balances and the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Group Treasury manages liquidity and flexibility in funding by monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and the maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities and by keeping committed credit lines available.
At the balance sheet date the group had committed undrawn borrowing facilities expiring as follows: 2011 2010 m m Within one year 41.7 Between one and two years 458.3 191.7 Between two and five years 458.3 500.0 650.0 Non-derivative financial instruments analysed by maturity date The following tables detail the groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative net financial liabilities.
The information presented is based on the earliest date on which the group can be required to pay and represents the undiscounted cash flows including principal and interest.
