Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 68 Notes to tHe AccoUNts For tHe YeAr eNded 31 octoBer 2011 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies General information Domino Printing Sciences plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 46.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 3 and in the report of the Directors on pages 44 to 46.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, being the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The Company has elected to also prepare financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except in respect of revalued properties as permitted by IFRS 1 and certain financial instruments of the Group and Company, and has been prepared on a basis consistent with the IFRS accounting policies set out below.
Standards and interpretations that have become effective in the current financial year but have had no material impact on the financial statements include: IFRS 1 amended 2009 oil and Gas Assets and Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRS 1 amended 2010 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters IFRS 2 amended 2009 Group Cash-Settled Share-Based Payment Transactions IAS 32 amended 2009 Classification of Rights Issues IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities and Equity Instruments Annual Improvements to IFRSs The Group has not presented the balance sheet for 2009 as required by IAS 1 revised following the adoption of these standards and interpretations as they have had no material impact on the balance sheet for 2011, 2010 or 2009.

Going concern The Groups business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are described within the Chief Executives operating and Business Review on pages 10 to 13 and Financial Review on pages 22 to 25.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review.
In addition, note 29 to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital and risk, along with details of exposures to credit riskand liquidity risk.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 69 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies continued The Group has considerable financial resources together with a broad spread of customers across different geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
The Directors have also considered the Groups forecasts and projections.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
basis of consolidation subsidiaries The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the entities controlled by the Group.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of the Groups subsidiaries.
The cost of acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
For acquisitions made before the year ended 31 october 2010, costs directly attributable to the transaction are also included in the measurement of acquisition cost, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 revised 2008.
For subsequent acquisitions, costs directly attributable to the transaction are recognised in the Income Statement as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are initially measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets is recorded as goodwill.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the effective date of acquisition orup to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, subsidiaries accounting policies are amended to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
The Companys investments in its subsidiaries are carried at cost less provision for any impairments.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence, but does not control, generally with a shareholding of 20 per cent to 50per cent of the voting rights.
The Group has a 25 per cent holding in Mectec Coding Benelux BV, a company incorporated in The netherlands, and a 40 per cent holding in Mectec Coding Benelux BVBA, a company incorporated in Belgium, both of which have been accounted for as associates.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The results and assets and liabilities of the Groups associates are wholly immaterial to the Groups results and balance sheet and therefore disclosure of the information required by IAS 28, Investments in Associates, has not been made.
Non-controlling interests non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling interests share of changes in equity since the date of combination.
Losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interests interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
contingent consideration Contingent consideration is payable to the former shareholders of current Group subsidiaries at amounts based on the future performance ofthose subsidiaries as agreed at the time of acquisition.
These liabilities have been measured at their fair value based on management estimates of the expected consideration payable and after discounting the amounts payable to their present value.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset atcost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the combination.
Cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently where there isan indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unitpro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 70 Notes to tHe AccoUNts For tHe YeAr eNded 31 octoBer 2011 coNtiNUed 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies continued on disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
acquired intangible assets business combinations Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination, and that can be separately and reliably measured at fair value, are separately recognised on acquisition.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement over their expected useful lives.
The periods over which the assets are being amortised are: Technology 510.5 years Customer relationships 511 years proprietary rights Proprietary rights are measured at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives currently 10 years.
software Software that is not integral to an item of hardware is classified as an intangible asset.
Amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the licence term and three years.
research and development expenditure IAS 38, Intangible assets, requires development spend to be recognised in the Income Statement as incurred unless the expenditure meets certain criteria, in which case it is capitalised and written off to the Income Statement over a suitable period.
The criteria used to determine the accounting treatment relate to the technical and commercial feasibility of the product or process, as well as the intention and ability of the entity to complete development, use or sell the resulting asset and reliably measure the development expenditure attributable to that asset.
Through its formal Product Creation Process, the Group monitors the extent to which development expenditure meets these criteria.
It capitalises this expenditure and writes it off to the Income Statement over a suitable period.
All other development expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
There was no expenditure capitalised in the period 2010: nil.
borrowing costs All borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
operating profit operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs, other exceptional costs and after the share of results of associates but before investment income and finance costs.
property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation with the exception of certain properties at the Groups Headquarters in Cambridge which are stated at deemed cost following transition to IFRS, being valuation less accumulated depreciation at 1 november 2004.
The Directors have considered the value of the assets that are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are satisfied that the aggregate value of those assets is not less than the aggregate amount at which they are stated in the companys accounts.
Depreciation of fixed assets is provided on a straight-line basis so as to write off their cost over their expected useful working lives.
The annual rates applied are: Freehold land nil Buildings 2.50% Motor vehicles owned 20% Motor vehicles leased Lease term Plant and machinery 5%20% Computer equipment 20%33% Fixtures and fittings 15%20% Leasehold improvements Lease term impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated inorder to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with anindefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 71 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies continued Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
leased assets Property, plant and equipment leased under finance leases is capitalised and depreciated over its expected useful life.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.
The costs of operating leases are charged to the Income Statement as they accrue.
equipment leased to customers Equipment leased to customers under operating leases is capitalised and depreciated on a straight line basis over its useful working life.
Costs capitalised comprise materials, direct labour and attributable overheads.
financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets non-derivative financial assets are classified as either available for sale financial assets or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with an original maturity of three months or less, balances on bank accounts, cash in transit and cash floats held in the business.
Bank overdrafts and interest bearing bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received, net of issue costs.
Finance charges are accounted for on an accruals basis and charged to the Income Statement when payable.
derecognition of financial assets The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire: or it transfers the financial assetand substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially allthe risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.
If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
For shares classified as available for sale AFS, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets, including redeemable notes classified as AFS and finance lease receivables, objective evidence of impairment could include: significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty: or default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: or it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 72 Notes to tHe AccoUNts For tHe YeAr eNded 31 octoBer 2011 coNtiNUed 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies continued For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are subsequently assessed for impairment on a collective basis.
objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Groups past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
When an AFS debt instrument is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the period.
With the exception of AFS equity instruments, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
In respect of AFS equity securities, impairment losses previously recognised through profit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss.
Any increase in fair value subsequent to an impairment loss is recognised directly in equity.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
equity instruments An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities.
other financial liabilities other financial liabilities include borrowings and trade and other payables and are initially measured at fair value net of transaction costs.
otherfinancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
derivative financial instruments and cash flow hedges The Group uses forward contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
The Group designates these instruments as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to profit or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in profit or loss, in the same line of the Income Statement as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, orexercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The fair value of the Groups and Companys forward contracts is shown as a financial asset and or liability at the balance sheet date.
In the Companys books, these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 and accordingly the movement in fair value between the two balance sheet dates is taken through profit or loss.
derecognition of financial liabilities The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
inventories Inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 73 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies continued Cost represents materials, direct labour and overheads attributable to the stage of production.
Cost is calculated using a weighted average method.
investment in own shares The cost of the Companys shares held by various trusts to satisfy equity-settled compensation schemes are deducted from equity attributable to shareholders in the Company and Group balance sheets.
revenue Revenue comprises sales to customers after discounts and excludes sales taxes.
Sales of products are recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, the sales price agreed and the receipt of payment is reasonably certain.
Sales of services are recognised when the service has been performed and the receipt of payment is reasonably certain.
Revenue on longerterm service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the service, generally on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract.
operating lease income is accounted for on a straight-line basis with any rental increases recognised during the period to which they relate.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
segment reporting The Groups primary reporting segment, as defined by IFRS 8, operating segments, is geographic by location of subsidiary, which reflects how the Board of Directors assesses segment performance and makes decisions about resource allocation.
share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2, Share-based payments.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 november 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
There are both non-market and market based performance conditions attached to the vesting and exercising of equity instruments.
Where plans have market based performance criteria, fair value is measured by the use of a Monte Carlo model, and by Black-Scholes models in all other cases.
The expected life used in the models is based on managements best estimate of behavioural consideration based on historic exercise patterns.
no changes to the fair value are made when the expected or actual level of awards vesting differs from the original estimate due to the non-attainment of market based conditions.
Charges made to the Income Statement in respect of share-based payments are credited back to Retained Earnings.
foreign currency translation The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on the retranslation of monetary items, are included in profit or loss for the year.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The trading results and cash flows from operations of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences arising in the consolidated accounts on the retranslation at the closing rate of the Groups opening net investments in foreign subsidiaries, together with any differences arising between the average rate and the closing rate in the Income Statement, are shown within a separate reserve in equity the Exchange Reserve.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 74 Notes to tHe AccoUNts For tHe YeAr eNded 31 octoBer 2011 coNtiNUed 1. basis of preparation anD accountinG policies continued Under IFRS, goodwill and intangible assets arising on acquisition of overseas subsidiaries must be considered to be denominated in the functional currency of the acquired company.
As such, foreign exchange differences arise due to the movement in exchange rates between balance sheet dates.
The differences arising are shown within the Exchange Reserve.
pension scheme arrangements The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme for its UK employees and has similar schemes in other countries.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in respect of the period.
taxation Current taxation is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws in the relevant territory that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax charged for the period reflects the expected tax payable for the period along with adjustments for tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences.
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the period when the temporary differences are expected to reverse, basedon tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Groups deferred tax provision ismeasured on an undiscounted basis.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly in equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
taxation reserve Elements of current and deferred tax arising on share-based compensation charges are recognised in the taxation reserve.
Where the accrued tax deduction in respect of these charges exceeds the cumulative remuneration expense recognised in profit or loss, the excess is recognised in this reserve.
Current taxation on the effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges is also recognised in the taxation reserve of the Group.
The taxation relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in Group profit or loss.
In the Companys books, since these forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, the current taxation on changes in fair value is taken to profit or loss.
Dividends Final dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Dividends are shown as a component of the movement in shareholders equity.
2. critical accountinG juDGements anD key sources of estimation anD uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 1, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period inwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a critical accounting judgements The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations which are dealt with separately below, that the Directors have made in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in thefinancial statements.
intangible assets acquired through the purchase of subsidiary undertakings In accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations, the Group is required to recognise, on the acquisition of a subsidiary, internally generated intangible assets which the acquired company may hold but are not reflected in the balance sheet of the subsidiary.
Examples of such assets would be trademarks, customer lists and networks, intellectual property rights and technology portfolios.
These assets are recognised separately from acquired goodwill.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 75 2. critical accountinG juDGements anD key sources of estimation anD uncertainty continued Valuing such assets is dependent on numerous factors, including company forecasts and market benchmark data.
Because of the complexity andsubjectivity of this work, the Group engages independent, third party valuation experts to advise on the value of material assets to be recognised on acquisition and the period over which these assets should be charged to the Income Statement.
b key sources of estimation and uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation and uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
The carrying value of goodwill at 31 october 2011 was 69,871,000.
Goodwill is initially measured as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
contingent consideration The Group initially estimates the amounts payable under earn-out plans to the former shareholders of acquired companies based on the business model produced at the time of acquisition.
Earn-out clauses within acquisition agreements typically contain provisions for amounts payable to the former shareholders based on future financial performance.
In order to calculate the expected future payments, the acquisition business model contains estimates of the future financial performance for the acquired business.
The post-acquisition performance and expected future performance of acquired companies is reviewed throughout the year.
Any adjustments required to contingent consideration arising from a significant departure of financial performance from the original acquisition plan are made as required.
A corresponding adjustment is made to goodwill for acquisitions made before the year ended 31 october 2010, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 revised 2008.
For subsequent acquisitions, the corresponding adjustment is made to the Income Statement, in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 revised 2008.
Available for sale financial assets Unlisted shares held by the Group that are traded in an active market are classified as being available for sale financial assets, in accordance withIAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, and are stated at fair value or cost.
These assets are included in non-current assets, as management do not intend to dispose of the investments within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The Group owns 15 per cent of TEn Media LLC see note 34, a company incorporated in the USA, 19.35 per cent of Graph-Tech AG, acompany incorporated in Switzerland, and 3.5 per cent of epc Solutions Inc. a company incorporated in the USA.
In assessing the fair value of each investment, the Directors have considered factors such as the recent performance of the company but alsothe relatively small percentage shareholding, the shareholder structure and the unquoted status of each of the companies shares.
These valuations and the considerations on which they are based are therefore not based on published price quotations or observable market data.
The Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to record the investments at their original cost at 31 october 2011, with the exception of the investment in epc Solutions Inc. which was fully impaired in 2008.
Therefore, no amounts were recognised in profit or loss or other comprehensive income during 2011 or 2010 in respect of any change in fair value.
There was no difference between the Directors valuations of these investments and the transaction prices on the dates these investments were made.
Where the range of reasonable fair value estimates is significant and the probabilities of the various estimates cannot be reasonably assessed, the investment is recorded at cost.
provisions The Group assesses the carrying value of both debtor and inventory balances based on past losses, current trading patterns and anticipated future events.

The weighted average number of shares used is 109,457,131 2010: 108,416,060. b Diluted earnings per share The weighted average number of shares used in the diluted earnings per share calculation is the figure used in the basic earnings per share calculation adjusted by 1,497,459, being the number of shares deemed to be issued for no consideration if all share options had been exercised.
The earnings used in the diluted earnings per share calculation is the profit on ordinary activities attributable to shareholders.
c underlying earnings per share The Group presents an alternative measure of earnings per share before the post-tax effects of: amortisation of intangible assets arising on business combinations: any exceptional costs incurred in the year: and the non-cash interest charge on discounted long-term contingent consideration.

Following the disposal of certain business and assets of Photon Energy GmbH and nWL Lasertechnologie GmbH in 2011, the remaining intellectual property and know-how associated with solid state lasers now form an integral part of the Groups core laser operations based in Hamburg.
Accordingly, the previously identified solid state laser CGU has been amalgamated into the Domino core CGU during the year.
This reflects better the risks and rewards of the products sold and the composition of the Group.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Domino core products 32,261 32,527 Citronix product range 9,956 9,902 Purex product range 4,864 4,931 Print and Apply product range 7,088 6,889 Thermal Transfer overprinting product range 6,397 6,214 Thermal Ink Jet product range 9,305 9,698 69,871 70,161 The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations arethose regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts within the CGUs.
Likewise, changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on recent history and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and, where applicable, relevant acquisition business plans.
Cash flow projections for the next five years are prepared based on these sources and estimated growth rates.
Cash flows beyond five years are then calculated into perpetuity using a growth rate of 2 per cent, on the basis that these businesses areheld for the long-term benefit of the Group.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for each CGU is 10 per cent.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis increasing the discount rate to 13 per cent.
At this level, the minimum headroom attributable to any CGU is 14,860,000 and, as such, no impairment would be required to be recorded.

on 6 october 2011, the Group acquired 88 per cent of the share capital of Kameleon Source Codes AS, increasing its shareholding from 10 per cent to 98 per cent and thereby obtaining control of the company.
Kameleon owns the intellectual property in a software solution the Group has developed to provide integration of its coding equipment with manufacturing and production systems.
The following table gives details of the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired and the total consideration paid: Book Fair value value 000 000 recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed Cash and cash equivalents 17 17 Intangibles 67 2,352 Accruals and other creditors 22 26 Deferred tax liability 611 Total identifiable assets 62 1,732 Less: non-controlling interest 33 total 1,699 satisfied by: Fair value of original investment 250 Cash 1,358 Contingent consideration 91 total 1,699 net cash outflow arising on acquisition Cash consideration 1,358 Less: cash and cash equivalent balances acquired 17 1,341 The contingent consideration arrangement is based on Group revenue targets for the sale of Coding Automation Software.
The potential undiscounted amount of all future payments that Domino Printing Sciences plc could be required to make under the contingent consideration arrangement is between nil and 323,000.
The fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement of 91,000 was estimated by calculating the amounts that would be payable were the Group to achieve its budgeted sales in respect of the Coding Automation Software products.
Acquisition-related costs included in administrative expenses amount to 5,000.
The total contribution of revenue and operating profit to the Groups results in 2011 is nil.
If the results of Kameleon Source Codes AS had been consolidated for the period of the Groups full financial year, neither Group revenues nor profit attributable to the shareholders of the Company would have been materially different.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
The Group manages foreign currency risk as detailed below.
The Group does not currently enter into any interest rate swaps or other derivative financial instruments to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates.
foreign currency risk management The Group manufactures products in the UK, Europe, the USA and Asia and sells its products and services across global markets in a range ofcurrencies.
This creates an exposure to both transactional and translational risk as rates of exchange fluctuate.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved treasury policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group is principally exposed to the impact of movements in the euro, the US dollar and the Chinese renminbi.
The carrying amounts ofthe Groups monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in these currencies at the reporting date are as follows: Group Company 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 assets Euro 24,289 26,869 2,354 2,920 US dollar 19,843 18,452 1,106 2,561 Renminbi 18,769 11,020 62,901 56,341 3,460 5,481 liabilities Euro 22,160 28,450 4,321 9,562 US dollar 5,947 10,890 Renminbi 6,426 7,104 34,533 46,444 4,321 9,562 Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 103 29. financial instruments continued foreign currency sensitivity analysis The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 10 per cent increase and decrease in sterling against the relevant foreign currencies.
10 per cent represents managements assessment of a reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis below shows the impact of a 10 per cent change in foreign currency rates on: i Foreign currency monetary assets and monetary liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date.
ii The value to the Group of its investments in foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the euro, the US dollar or the Chinese renminbi.
Profit Equity or loss Group 000 000 2011 Euro 2,282 144 US dollar 2,421 1,532 Renminbi 1,371 407 6,074 1,795 2010 Euro 2,007 507 US dollar 1,723 1,449 Renminbi 435 507 4,165 1,449 Profit Equity or loss Company 000 000 2011 Euro 1,896 US dollar 1,979 3,875 2010 Euro 2,183 559 US dollar 883 964 3,066 405 The movement in profit for the year is mainly attributable to the Groups exposure to exchange movements in US dollar, euro and renminbi denominated monetary assets and liabilities.
The movement in equity is mainly as a result of the Groups exposure to its investments in subsidiaries in Europe, the USA and China, in addition to US dollar and euro denominated long-term intercompany loans made by the Company.
In managements opinion, the sensitivity analysis above is not fully representative of the inherent foreign exchange risk to which the Group is exposed as it does not take account of the impact on the Income Statement of translation of the annual profits and losses made by overseas subsidiaries.
Domino Printing Sciences plc | Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 104 Notes to tHe AccoUNts For tHe YeAr eNded 31 octoBer 2011 coNtiNUed 29. financial instruments continued forward foreign exchange contracts It is the policy of the Group to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to cover anticipated receipts and purchases in selected foreign currencies within 50 per cent to 90 per cent of the net exposure generated.
Contracts denominated in euros and US dollars are placed on a rolling 12 month basis.
Smaller contracts are also placed, typically over no more than three months, in a variety of other currencies in which theGroup trades.
All of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as effective cash flow hedges under IAS 39 for the purposes of hedge accounting.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with forward foreign exchange contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges are expected to occur: Carrying Expected Less than 36 612 amount cash flows 3 months months months Group and Company 000 000 000 000 000 2011 Forward foreign exchange contracts 125 19,108 3,966 4,991 10,151 2010 Forward foreign exchange contracts 190 19,032 2,834 6,476 9,722 interest rate risk management and sensitivity The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow and deposit funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate cash deposits and borrowings.
The sensitivity analysis below assumes that for floating rate cash deposits and liabilities, the quantum as at the balance sheet date was in place for the whole year.
If interest rates had been 1 per cent higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit for the year ended 31 october 2011 would increase decrease by 228,000.
The Companys profit for the year ended 31 october 2011 would decrease increase by 73,000. credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group has adopted a cautious approach to credit risk management, only entering into transactions with counterparties with recognised credit ratings: either through independent third party appraisal or through the Groups own trading records and other publicly available financial information.
The Groups exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are continuously monitored and credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits.
Disclosures related to the credit risk associated with trade receivables are shown in note 19. liquidity risk management The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
The following tables detail the Groups and the Companys remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.

fair value of financial instruments The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: i The fair value of a non-derivative financial asset and financial liability is the carrying amount, as this approximates their fair value.
ii The fair value of a derivative is estimated by calculating the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price at the balance sheet date for the residual maturity of the contract.
The carrying amounts of all financial assets and liabilities in the financial statements approximate their fair values.
