The fair value of the Groups investment and development property as at 31 December 2011 was determined by independent external valuers at that date.
The valuations conform with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Standards 7th Edition and with IVS 1 of International Valuation Standards, and were arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent, taking into account forecast growth rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives offered to tenants.
A summary of the market value of investment and development property by valuer is given below: 2011 2010 m m DTZ 4,012.6 3,978.9 Cushman & Wakefield 1,700.0 CBRE 931.4 845.2 Knight Frank 286.3 242.8 Others 29.9 32.2 6,960.2 5,099.1 Valuation fees are based on a fixed amount agreed between the Group and the valuers and are independent of the portfolio value.
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property where a credit facility secured on that property is in place.
In most circumstances the Group can realise up to 50 per cent without restriction providing the Group continues to manage the asset.
Realising an amount in excess of this would trigger a change of control and mandatory repayment of the facility.

Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Overview Business model Business Financial Corporate Governance Accounts Other Annual Report 2011 111 and strategy review review responsibility information 34 Financial risk management The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks arising from the Groups operations being principally market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange and market price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department and the policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises of both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically issued at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
Bond debt and other capital market debt are generally issued at fixed rates.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of the Groups lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Such swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate interest rate swaps, as discussed in the Financial review on pages 41 to 47.
The table below shows the effects of interest rate swaps on the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Borrowings 980.6 2,630.9 431.1 2,366.4 Derivative impact nominal value of interest rate swaps 2,476.7 2,476.7 2,117.6 2,117.6 Net borrowings profile 3,457.3 154.2 2,548.7 248.8 Interest rate protection on floating debt 94.1% 89.5% Group policy is to target interest rate protection within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate for interest rate swaps currently effective is 4.38 per cent 2010 4.98 per cent.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would be a positive movement of 93.6 million 2010 93.8 million in the fair value of derivatives.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would be a negative movement of 102.7 million 2010 97.7 million in the fair value of derivatives.
Movements in the fair value of derivatives are dealt with in the income statement.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the above sensitivity analysis is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur.
Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
Details of interest rate swap contracts in place as at 31 December 2011 are included in the Financial review on page 46, which shows the interest costs to the Group will be subject to in the future regardless of changes in market interest rates for the nominal amount of debt in the contract.
b Foreign exchange Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a functional currency other than sterling.
It has been Group policy to partially eliminate the foreign exchange risk through hedging instruments and foreign currency denominated borrowings.
This policy will continue to be reviewed as existing swaps mature.
The table summarises the Group exposure to foreign currency risk arising from the Groups investments at 31 December 2011: Group Group 2011 2010 US$m US$m Net assets total US dollar exposure 261.8 199.7 Derivative impact nominal forward foreign exchange swaps 140.0 140.0 Net exposure 121.8 59.7 Prior to its disposal on 4 January 2011 the Groups hedge was against its net investment in C&C US.
Following this the Group has a fair value hedge against its US available-for-sale investments.
There was no ineffectiveness arising as a result of these hedges in either year.
Certain other Group investments are denominated in Indian Rupees other than sterling, however, they do not currently constitute material risks under the Group risk framework.
This remains under constant review.

Liquidity analysis is conducted to ensure that sufficient headroom is available to meet the Groups operational requirements and committed investments.
The Group treasury policy aims to meet this objective through maintaining adequate cash, marketable securities and committed facilities to meet these requirements.
Undrawn borrowing facilities are detailed in note 30.
The Groups policy is to seek to optimise its exposure to liquidity risk by balancing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
In effect the Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
Group policy is to maintain a weighted average debt maturity of over five years: as at 31 December 2011, the maturity profile of Group debt showed an average maturity of seven years 2010 six years.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its borrowings and seeks to avoid bunching of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by using a selection of maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by re-borrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
The Group may choose to pre-fund significant capital expenditure by arranging facilities or raising debt in the capital markets and then placing surplus funds on deposit until required for the project.
Efficient treasury management and strict credit control minimise the costs and risk associated with this policy which ensures that funds are available to meet commitments as they fall due.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal including notional principal in the case of gross settled foreign exchange contracts.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve for the relevant currency.
Where payment obligations are in foreign currencies, the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date is used.

Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups holdings of assets with counterparties such as cash deposits, loans and derivative instruments.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and, wherever possible, identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed via a review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information, which is conducted internally.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2011 is 3.1 million 2010 2.5 million.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is Group policy to calculate any impairment of receivables specifically on each contract.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables is as follows: Group Group 2011 2010 m m Up to three months 17.8 12.3 Three to six months 1.4 3.2 Trade receivables 19.2 15.5 At 31 December 2011 trade receivables are shown net of provisions totalling 4.3 million 2010 2.6 million.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by the Groups treasury department.
Relationships are maintained with a number of tier one institutional counterparties, ensuring compliance with Group policy relating to limits on the credit ratings of counterparties between BBB and AAA.
Excessive credit risk concentration is avoided through adhering to authorised limits for all counterparties.

Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

As a condition of the acquisition the Company also issued to the Peel Group 12,316,817 ordinary shares for 3.55 each and convertible bonds with a nominal value of 26.7 million convertible into 6,679,250 ordinary shares, for a subscription amount of 23.7 million and an implied issue price of the underlying shares of 3.55 each.
Total exceptional administration expenses associated with the acquisition and integration are 21.6 million of which 4.0 million were recognised in 2010 and the balance of 17.6 million in 2011.
Through its subsidiaries CSC Trafford Centre Group Limited owns and operates The Trafford Centre in Manchester.
Further details of the business are given in the Business review.
The fair value of the consideration paid has been assessed as 702.7 million, consisting of 582.8 million in respect of the ordinary shares and 119.9 million in respect of the convertible bonds.
The fair value has been assessed using the Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC opening share price on 28 January 2011 of 3.76, being the share price at the point the acquisition took place.

The trade and other liabilities book value includes the REIT entry charge of 33.0 million.
The fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration and as a result a gain of 52.9 million is recognised in the income statement on acquisition.
This gain reflects the CSC share price at the date of the acquisition of 3.76 which, in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, is required to be used to assess the fair value of the consideration for acquisition accounting purposes.
The acquisition was however agreed based on an issue price of the CSC ordinary shares of 4.00.
The difference between the agreed issue price of 4.00 and the share price at the date the acquisition was completed of 3.76 is the principal reason for recording an accounting gain on the acquisition.
Amounts disclosed have been adjusted from those reported in the Groups interim financial statements to reflect the finalisation of the review of the acquired net assets and liabilities.
This has resulted in an increase of 1.4 million in the trade and other payables recognised with a resulting reduction in the gain in the income statement.
During the year the acquired companies contributed 80.5 million to the revenue of the Group and 25.4 million to the profit for the year.
The acquisition of The Trafford Centre has contributed 29.6 million to the underlying earnings of the Group for the year including the deduction of 5.3 million in relation to interest on the convertible bonds which is deducted directly in equity.
Had the acquisition taken place at 1 January 2011 the revenue of the Group for the year would have been 524.1 million and the profit for the year would have been 36.3 million.
Acquisition of Broadmarsh On 1 December 2011 the Group acquired a 100 per cent interest in The Broadmarsh Retail Limited Partnership for an initial cash consideration of 72.8 million.
The final consideration will be adjusted for the agreed net assets value of the business at 1 December 2011 which is expected to result in a reduction to the purchase price of 2.1 million.
The fair value of the consideration is therefore assessed as 70.7 million.
Exceptional administration costs of 3.3 million associated with the acquisition have been recognised in the income statement.
The Broadmarsh Retail Limited Partnership owns and manages the Broadmarsh shopping centre, Nottingham.

This goodwill represents future cash flows which the Group expects to receive as a result of the acquisition.
During the year the acquired business contributed 0.3 million to the revenue of the Group and 0.1 million to the profit for the year.
Had the acquisition taken place at 1 January 2011 the revenue of the Group for the year would have been 521.2 million and the profit for the year would have been 53.0 million.

48 Share-based payment The Group operates a number of share-based payment arrangements providing employee benefits and incentives.
All schemes are equity settled, and as such the expense recognised in the income statement is assessed based on the fair value of the equity instruments awarded as determined at their grant date.
The expense is recognised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period based on Group estimates of the number of shares that are expected to vest.
Share Option Schemes Options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Approved Share Option Scheme and the Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
Exercise is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition which requires Capital Shopping Centres Group smoothed earnings to grow over a three year period commencing with the year of grant at a rate in excess of 5 per cent per annum compound.
Smoothed earnings growth means the percentage increase in underlying earnings per share, adjusted by a excluding exceptional and valuation items and b limiting trading or non-recurring items to 10 per cent of profit before tax.
For the award made in 2009 exceptionally, the base figure for comparison purposes is the smoothed earnings achieved in 2009 for comparison with the three year period commencing with 2010.
Except in the case of a good leaver, options may not be exercised within three years of grant and before satisfaction or waiver of any applicable performance condition, and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options become capable of exercise.
The options automatically lapse if not exercised within 10 years of the date of grant.
In 2010 individuals who received awards made in 2009 and 2010 were given the option to modify their awards.
Where this modification option was taken, the future exercise of their existing share options was capped based on the share price at the date of modification and they participate in the Joint Share Ownership Plan from that date as described below.
As required by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, the fair value of the award is measured immediately before the modification and immediately after and any increase in fair value must be recognised as an expense through the income statement over the performance period.
Under this test it was found that no additional expense was required.

The first transaction is the acquisition for 4.7 million from Clydeport Properties Limited of a 30.96 acre site known as King George V Docks West adjacent to CSCs shopping centre at Braehead, Glasgow.
The second transaction is the acquisition for 2.5 million from Peel Holdings Limited of a three year option alongside a refundable deposit of 7.5 million to purchase two parcels of land in the province of Malaga, Spain: an approximately 60 acre site which has initial planning consents for the construction of a high-class regional shopping centre and leisure development, and an adjacent approximately 14 acre site which is earmarked for possible future development.
