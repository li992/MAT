The movements shown below largely result from trade payables and receivables that are not denominated in the local entitys functional currency.
Trade payables and receivables generally arise as a result of the operations of the Group in the ordinary course of business.
The currency sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements of subsidiaries or joint ventures into the Groups presentation currency, US$, are not taken into consideration: the major currency exposures for the Group relate to the US$ and local currencies of subsidiaries and joint ventures.
Foreign currency exposures between two currencies where one is not the US$ are deemed insignificant to the Group and have therefore been excluded from the sensitivity analysis: derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective hedges and therefore any movements in carrying value are captured within equity and have no impact on the income statement analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective with no impact on the income statement or equity: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships are assumed to impact the income statement: and the impact of foreign currency movements on the carrying value of pension obligations has been excluded.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of foreign currencies has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in foreign currency exchange rates over the course of a period of time.
If the US$ had gained lost 5% against all currencies significant to the Group, the impact would have been: Effect on net Effect on Effect on net Effect on Closing earnings of a equity of a Closing earnings of a equity of a exchange rate 5% change 5% change exchange rate 5% change 5% change 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 Local currency to the US$ US$:ARS 4 4.3063 4 3.9759 3 AUD:US$ 1 1.0205 3 1 1.0233 10 1 Fair values US$:CAD 1 1.0212 5 0.9983 7 US$:CLP 5 519.50 5 468.00 5 US$:COP 1 1,938 1,920 2 Carrying Fair value value EUR:US$ 1 1.2960 4 1.3387 3 2011 2011 GBP:US$ 1 1.5550 1.5613 1 US$:PEN 2 2.6904 4 2.8063 4 9,628 9,628 US$:ZAR 8 8.0796 8 6.6276 17 204 210 Total 9 1 10 1 204 206 Commodity price risk 8 8 The Group is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, with the commodity mix spread between those that are priced by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets and those that are set on a contract basis with customers, generally on an annual basis.
Commodity price risks arise in all major commodities that the Group produces.
Commodity price risk is managed by maintaining a diversified portfolio of commodities and typically does not involve large-scale strategic hedging or price management initiatives.
Due to the volatile nature of commodity prices and the historical relationship between prices and the currencies of most of the countries where the Group operates, hedging may be entered into only in limited circumstances and subject to strict limits laid down by the Board of Directors.
