Other deferred tax assets consist principally of deferred tax on bad debt provision, forward foreign exchange contracts, staff bonus accrual and timing differences in respect of revenue recognition.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2011 2010 000 000 Deferred tax liabilities 2,801 1,426 Deferred tax assets 3,638 5,016 837 3,590 At the Balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 2,241,000 2010 5,072,000 available for offset against future profits.
Of the total deferred tax asset of 760,433 2010 1,584,000, nil 2010 nil has been recognised and is included in other above.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
These losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the Balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of overseas subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was approximately 34,100,000 2010 23,300,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
It is likely that the majority of the overseas earnings would qualify for the UK dividend exemptions but may be subject to foreign withholding taxes.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of dividends by AVEVA Group plc to its shareholders.
