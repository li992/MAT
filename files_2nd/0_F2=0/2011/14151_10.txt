Financial Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies Group and Company General information Shanks Group plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union EU and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments, which are stated at fair value.
The policies set out below have been consistently applied.
The Group has applied all accounting standards and interpretations issued relevant to its operations and effective for accounting periods beginning on 1 April 2010.
The following new standards and amendments to standards, which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2010, are relevant for the Group: IFRS 3 revised, Business Combinations.
The revised standard applies to business combinations completed on or after 1 April 2010 with no requirement to re-state previous business combinations.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations with some significant changes.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at acquisition date, with contingent consideration payments classified as a liability and subsequently re-measured through the Consolidated Income Statement.
All acquisition related costs are expensed.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree at either fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
There has been no material impact to the Groups financial statements on adopting IFRS 3 revised.
IAS 27 revised, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
As the Group has adopted IFRS 3 revised it is required to adopt IAS 27 revised at the same time which applies prospectively for transactions occurring after 1 April 2010.
The revised standard requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and such transactions no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses arising.
The revised standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
In such instances any remaining interest in the entity is re-measured to fair value and a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss.
There has been no material impact to the Groups financial statements on adopting IAS 27 revised.
The following amendments to standards and interpretations, which are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 April 2010, are either not currently relevant or material for the Group: IFRIC 17, Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners: IAS 39 amendment, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Eligible Hedged Items: IFRS 1 revised, First-time Adoption of IFRS: IFRS 1 amendment, Additional Exemptions for First-time Adopters, effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010: IFRS 2 amendment, Share-based Payment Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions: IAS 32 amendment, Financial Instruments: Presentation, classification of Rights Issues, effective for annual periods commencing on or after 1 February 2010: and Improvements to IFRSs 2009.
It is anticipated that the adoption of the following amendments to standards and interpretations in future periods which were also in issue but were not effective at the date of authorisation of these financial statements, will have no material impact on the results of the Group.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments, issued in December 2009, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, subject to EU endorsement: IAS 24 revised, Related Party Disclosures, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011: 98 Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 IFRS 1 amendment, Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures for First-time Adopters, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010: IFRIC 14 amendment, Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, subject to EU endorsement: and IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shanks Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are incorporated in the financial statements by proportional consolidation.
Wholly owned subsidiary companies set up under PFI PPP contracts are fully consolidated by the Group.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost or, in the case of a disposal of the majority shareholding, fair value.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements up to, or from, the date control passes.
PFI PPP contracts The Groups PFI PPP contracts are all integrated waste management contracts.
Under these contracts, the existing Local Authority waste management services are operated by the Group from inception of the contract.
The contracts require the building of new infrastructure to add to that inherited from the previous service provider and all rights to the infrastructure pass to the Local Authority at the termination or expiry of the contract.
The payments made to contractors for the construction of the infrastructure are accounted for as financial assets.
The Group splits the local authority payment between a service element as revenue and a repayment element that is deducted from the financial asset.
Interest receivable is added to the financial asset based on the rate implied in the contract payments.
Reviews are undertaken regularly to ensure that the financial asset will be recovered over the contract life.
Borrowing costs relating to contract specific external borrowings are expensed in the income statement.
Bid costs are expensed in the income statement until the Group is appointed preferred bidder and there is a high probability that a contract will be awarded.
Bid costs incurred after this point are capitalised within trade and other receivables.
When the contract is awarded, the costs are included in the relevant financial asset.
Win fees are transferred to deferred income upon financial close and released to the income statement over the period of construction of the PFI PPP infrastructure.
Revenue Revenue represents the fair value of consideration receivable, including landfill tax but excluding sales taxes, discounts and inter company sales, for goods and services provided.
Revenue is recognised when processing occurs or when the service is provided.
Income from electricity generated includes an estimation of the amount to be received.
Income from recycling activities includes amounts based upon market prices for recyclate products.
Exceptional items Items are classified as exceptional and disclosed separately due to their size or incidence to enable a better understanding of performance.
These include but are not limited to significant impairments and the profit or loss on disposals of properties.
Share-based payments The fair value of awards granted is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Adjustments to the amounts expensed are only made in respect of non-market related factors.
Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Shanks Group plc 99 Information Financial Governance Performance Strategy Overview Financial Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies Group and Company continued Business combinations The acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given and liabilities incurred or assumed.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed, meeting the conditions for recognition, are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
The costs of acquisition are charged to the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Separately recognised goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Any impairment is charged immediately to the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs for the purpose of impairment testing.
The allocation is made to those CGUs or groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS 31 March 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP net book value following impairment tests.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated.
ii Landfill void When landfill operations are acquired, landfill void is capitalised based on the fair value of the void acquired and is amortised over its estimated useful life on a void usage basis.
iii Other intangibles Other intangible assets are capitalised on the basis of the fair value of the assets acquired or on the basis of costs incurred to purchase and bring the assets into use.
These are amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight line basis as follows: Computer software 1 to 5 years Waste permits 5 to 20 years Others 5 to 10 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment except for freehold land is stated at cost less depreciation and provision for impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
i Buildings, plant and machinery Depreciation is provided on these assets to write off their cost by equal annual instalments over the expected useful economic lives.
The expected useful life of buildings is 25 to 50 years.
Plant and machinery lives are as follows: Computer equipment 1 to 5 years Mobile plant 5 years Generation equipment 8 to 15 years Heavy goods vehicles 5 to 10 years Other items 3 to 20 years ii Landfill sites Site development costs including engineering works and the discounted cost of final site restoration are capitalised.
These costs are written off over the operational life of each site based on the amount of void space consumed.
Impairment of assets Assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated in order to determine the extent of any impairment loss.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value.
If the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than the carrying amount the asset is reduced to the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately as an operating expense.
100 Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Leased assets i Finance leases Where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a leased asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Leased assets are included in property, plant and equipment at the total of the capital elements of the payments during the lease term and the corresponding obligation is included in payables.
Depreciation is provided to write down the assets over the shorter of the expected useful life and the lease term.
ii Operating leases All leases other than finance leases are treated as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.
The obligation to pay future rentals on operating leases is shown in note 30 to the accounts.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value and are measured on a first in first out basis.
Government grants and subsidies Capital related government grants are released to the income statement evenly over the expected useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Revenue grants and subsidies are credited in the same period as the items to which they relate.
Unprocessed waste The accrual or deferred income relating to unprocessed waste is calculated at the higher of sales value or processing cost.
Where there is a significant delay between the acceptance of waste and its final disposal then profit may be recognised in advance of final disposal over the period of delay provided the outcome of the waste treatment process is certain.
Deferred consideration Deferred consideration is provided for at the net present value NPV of the Groups expected cost or receipt at the date of acquisition or disposal.
The likelihood of payment for deferred consideration conditional on meeting certain performance targets is considered on acquisition or disposal.
For acquisitions after 1 April 2010, any differences between consideration accrued and consideration paid or received are charged or released to the income statement, before this date differences are adjusted through goodwill.
Site restoration provision Full provision is made for the NPV of the Groups unavoidable costs in relation to restoration liabilities at its landfill sites and this value is capitalised and amortised over the useful life of the site.
In addition the Group continues to provide for the NPV of intermediate restoration costs over the life of its landfill sites and mineral extraction sites, based on the quantity of waste deposited or mineral extracted in the year.
Aftercare provision Provision is made for the NPV of post closure costs at the Groups landfill sites based on the quantity of waste deposited in the year.
Similar costs incurred during the operating life of the sites are written off directly to the income statement and not charged to the provision.
Discounting Deferred consideration and all long term provisions for restoration, aftercare and onerous leases are calculated based on the NPV of estimated future costs.
The effects of inflation and unwinding of the discount element on existing provisions are reflected within the financial statements as a finance charge.
The real discount factor currently applied is 2%.
Retirement benefits The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS19 Employee Benefits.
For defined benefit plans, obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at market value.
The operating and financing costs of the plans are recognised separately in the income statement and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full through the statement of comprehensive income.
Surpluses on defined benefit plans are recognised only to the extent that they are recoverable.
Movements in irrecoverable surpluses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they become due.
The Group participates in several multi-employer schemes in the Netherlands.
These are accounted for as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to split the assets and liabilities of the schemes between participating companies, and the Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Shanks Group plc 101 Information Financial Governance Performance Strategy Overview Financial Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1.
Accounting policies Group and Company continued Tax i Current tax Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years or that are never taxable or deductible.
The liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted, or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in full where the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the financial statements is different to the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profits.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that the taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it relates to items charged or credited through the statement of comprehensive income or directly to reserves, when it is charged or credited there.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the year end exchange rate.
Transactions and the results of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures in foreign currencies are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year and the resulting exchange differences are recognised in the Groups exchange reserve.
Cumulative exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the year in which an overseas subsidiary undertaking is disposed of.
The Group applies the hedge accounting principles of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement relating to net investment hedging to offset the exchange differences arising on foreign currency denominated borrowings with the translation of foreign operations.
Net investment hedges are accounted for by recognising exchange rate movements in the exchange reserve, with any hedge ineffectiveness being charged to the income statement in the period the ineffectiveness arises.
Financial instruments i Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
ii Financial assets in PFI PPP contracts Financial assets in PFI PPP contracts are classified as loans and receivables and are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration paid and subsequently amortised using the effective interest rate method.
iii Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with a maturity of three months or less and bank overdrafts.
iv External borrowings Interest bearing bank loans and bonds are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying amount of the borrowings to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
v Trade payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
vi Derivative financial instruments As part of the Groups PFI PPP contracts and loan facility requirements, the Group has a number of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges.
Swaps entered into before 31 March 2009 are measured at fair value at each reporting date with gains or losses between period ends being taken to finance charges in the income statement.
Swaps entered into after 31 March 2009 are considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies and is in accordance with established guidelines.
This requires that the hedging relationship is documented at its inception and to ensure that the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective, and requires that its effectiveness can be reliably measured.
The portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is effective is recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness is recognised in the Income Statement.
The gains or losses that are recognised directly in equity are transferred to the Income Statement in the same period in which the highly probable forecast transaction affects income, for example when the future interest payment is required.
102 Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 vii Other receivables and other payables O ther receivables and other payables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Lease agreements in which the other party, as lessee, is regarded as the economic owner of the leased assets give rise to accounts receivable in the amount of the discounted future lease payments.
Contingent liabilities The Company and certain subsidiaries have, in the normal course of business, given guarantees and performance bonds relating to the Groups contracts.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved.
Segmental reporting The Groups organisational structure reflects the national nature of markets in which it operates, with divisions in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Areas which management believes require the most critical accounting judgements and estimates are: Underlying business performance Shanks Group plc believes that trading profit, underlying profit before tax, underlying profit after tax, underlying free cash flow and underlying earnings per share provide useful information on underlying trends to shareholders.
These measures are used by the Group for internal performance analysis and incentive compensation arrangements for employees.
The terms trading profit, exceptional items and underlying are not defined terms under IFRS and may therefore not be comparable with similarly titled profit measures reported by other companies.
It is not intended to be a substitute for, or superior to GAAP measurements of profit.
The term underlying refers to the relevant measure being reported for continuing operations excluding exceptional items, financing fair value remeasurements and amortisation of acquisition intangibles, excluding landfill void and computer software.
Trading profit is defined as continuing operating profit before amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Reconciliations are set out in note 4.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for which actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The pension cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with managements best estimates using the advice of an independent qualified actuary and assumptions in the latest actuarial valuation.
The principal assumptions in connection with the Groups retirement benefit schemes are set out in note 26.
Impairment of intangible assets In conducting the impairment review on goodwill and intangibles management is required to make estimates of discount rates, future profitability, growth rates and tax rates.
Detailed descriptions of assumptions and values are given in note 13.
Tax The Group operates in the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada, all of which have their own tax legislation.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised at the current tax rate which may not be the tax rate at which they unwind.
The Group has available tax losses, some of which have been recognised as a tax asset and some have not based on managements best estimate of the ability of the Group to utilise those losses.
Further information is set out in note 18.
Provisions Restoration and aftercare provisions are recognised in the financial statements at the net present value of the estimated future expenditure required to settle the Groups restoration and aftercare provisions.
A discount is applied to recognise the time value of money and is unwound over the life of the provision.
Provisions also include the present value of the estimated operating losses on loss making contracts.
Further information is set out in note 25.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Shanks Group plc 103 Information Financial Governance Performance Strategy Overview Financial Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates continued PFI PPP contracts Financial assets are recognised in accordance with IFRIC 12.
They represent the present value of the future cash flows of the contract.
These cash flows are dependent on, amongst other things, tonnages, indexation, recycling rates and labour costs.
Segmental reporting Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Board of Directors and the executive committee.
The Group operates in The Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom and Canada.
As discussed in the strategy section on pages 10 to 45 the Group is organised and managed mainly by geographical location.
Each geographical location can be analysed according to the following types of activity: Solid Waste Non-hazardous solid waste collections, transfer, recycling and treatment Hazardous Waste Principally contaminated waste including industrial cleaning, transport, treatment including contaminated soils and disposal and contaminated land remediation Organic Treatment Anaerobic digestion and tunnel composting of source segregated organic waste streams Municipal - PFI Contracts Long term United Kingdom municipal waste treatment contracts Landfill and Power Landfill disposal including contaminated soils and power generation from landfill gas Sand Quarry Mineral extraction Belgium Landfill is viewed separately to Belgium Power.
In addition to the waste activities detailed above the Group has small infrastructure and groundworks operations in Belgium and the Netherlands.
Due to their small size the infrastructure and groundworks activities are reported as part of the Solid Waste activities.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in note 1, except that pension expense for the United Kingdom is recognised and measured on the basis of cash payments to the pension plan.
The profit measure the Group uses to evaluate performance is trading profit.
Trading profit is operating profit before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles excluding landfill void and computer software and exceptional items.
The Group accounts for inter-segment trading on an arms length basis.

Reconciliation of underlying information and exceptional items continued The Group has recognised an exceptional gain of 3.7m net of associated taxes arising from the 24.6m sale of all of the subordinated debt and 80 per cent of the equity in the East London Waste Authority ELWA and Dumfries and Galloway D&G PFI contracts.
The gain is stated net of costs, net assets disposed and a gross 9.6m provision for the remaining life of the D&G operating contract.
The removal of the net assets of the subsidiaries has resulted in a significant decrease in trade and other receivables and in non-recourse net debt.
An exceptional tax credit of 8.5m arose in the year relating to the partial release of provisions booked in March 2009 in respect of the abolition of Industrial Buildings Allowances relating to these contracts.
A detailed review of historic capital allowances on PFI infrastructure was performed which has been agreed with the taxation authorities.
With effect from 31 March 2011, the Group has introduced a pensionable pay increase cap of 1% per annum that applies to the benefit that active non-local government passport section members can accrue in the scheme.
This has led to an exceptional credit of 3.9m.
Changes in market conditions in wood based and landfill markets have resulted in goodwill impairments of 11.9m and further disclosure is given in note 13.

Company income statement As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own income statement for the year.
Shanks Group plc reported a loss for the year ended 31 March 2011 of 4,300,000 2010: 5,200,000.
The Company operates solely in the United Kingdom providing Central Services.
The Company is registered in Scotland under company number SC077438.

Contingent consideration for the 2007 acquisition of Orgaworld has been reassessed resulting in a decrease of 1.7m to goodwill.
Goodwill impairment Impairment testing is carried out at cash generating unit CGU level on an annual basis.
A segment level summary of the goodwill allocation is presented below.
2011 2010 m m Netherlands 212.8 224.5 Belgium 14.4 18.6 United Kingdom 18.8 12.9 246.0 256.0 A significant part of the goodwill, 144.3m 2010: 145.4m, relates to the acquisition of the original business in the Netherlands in 2000.
114 Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 The Group estimates the recoverable amount of a CGU using a value in use model by projecting cash flows for the next five years from the annual strategy review together with a terminal value using a growth rate and all cash flows are discounted at the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC.
In circumstances where this is considered inappropriate, such as for landfill sites, projected cash flows may be estimated over much longer periods of up to 25 years.
The post-tax discount rate used is 8% 2010 8%.
As most CGUs have integrated operations across large parts of the Group this is considered appropriate for all parts of the business.
The Group WACC is equivalent to a pre-tax discount rate of 11% to 12%.
The standard growth rate used in the annuity is 2% 2010: 2% and does not exceed the long term average growth.
Management determined the five year plan based on past performance and its expectation of market developments.
In most cases the valuations indicated sufficient headroom such that a reasonably possible change to key assumptions would be unlikely to result in an impairment of the related goodwill.
Where the impairment test indicated that the recoverable value of the unit was close to or below its carrying value, the testing was reperformed using a pre-tax discount rate and pre-tax cash flows in order to determine if an impairment existed and to establish its magnitude.
Impairment losses The goodwill relating to two Solid Waste CGUs, one in Netherlands and one in Belgium has been impaired at 31 March 2011.
No class of asset other than goodwill was impaired.
For the Netherlands CGU legislation, taxation and lower gate fees from alternatives to landfill is making landfill less competitive.
This position is not expected to reverse.
Consequently goodwill relating to landfill and associated businesses in the Solid Waste segment has been impaired by 7.9m.
For the purpose of this calculation, a pre-tax discount rate of 11% has been applied to pre-tax cash flows based on profits which included an annuity growth rate of 2.3%.
The downturn in the wood trading markets and the performance to date of the CGU in Belgium have resulted in goodwill relating to the CGU being impaired by 4.0m.
For the purpose of this calculation, a pre-tax discount rate of 12% has been applied to pre tax cash flows based on profits which included an annuity growth rate of 2.0%.
The net impairment losses recognised in the consolidated income statement within exceptional administrative expenses, in respect of goodwill and intangibles were as follows: 2011 2010 m m Netherlands Solid Waste 7.9 Belgium Solid Waste 4.0 0.3 United Kingdom 11.9 0.3 Sensitivity analysis There is residual goodwill of 15.1m and 0.2m in the Netherlands and Belgian CGUs respectively after impairing the goodwill to its recoverable amount.
An adverse change in assumptions of 1% on the discount rate and 0.25% on the growth rate would reduce goodwill in the Netherlands by 3.8m and 0.8m respectively.
Other intangible assets impairment Other intangible assets includes site or waste permits, customer lists and other acquired intangible assets as well as computer software.
During the prior year the intangible associated with the acquisition of part of the Solid Waste division in Belgium was considered impaired when the decision to exit that part was made.

Shanks took UUs place on all of its existing bids including preferred bidder for a PPP municipal solid waste treatment contract for both Derbyshire County and Derby City Councils and short-list positions at Leicestershire, Derry and Gloucestershire.
Shanks also acquired additional skilled technical and commercial resources from the UU bid team, strengthening and complementing its existing resources to enable it to deliver on its increased pipeline of PFI opportunities.
From acquisition to 31 March 2011, the acquired interests have contributed 12.7m to revenue and 0.8m to profit after tax.
Had the business been acquired on 1 April 2010 it would have contributed 29.5m to revenue and 1.7m to profit after tax.

Had the business been acquired on 1 April 2010 it would have contributed 3.5m to revenue and 0.4m to profit after tax.
In February 2011, the Group signed a teaming agreement with Babcock International Babcock in respect of the Wakefield PFI project.
Under this agreement Shanks will work with Babcock to bring the Wakefield PFI project to financial close and then acquire its waste business.
For acquisitions completed in the year ended 31 March 2010 there have been no amendments to the provisional fair values disclosed last year.

Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences under the liability method using applicable local tax rates.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 6.3m 2010: 18.8m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 9.9m 2010: 7.6m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Tax losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No liability has been recognised on the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries because the Group is in a position to control the timing and method of the reversal of these differences and it is probable that such differences will not give rise to a tax liability in the foreseeable future.
During the year, the Group has received indication of a favourable judgement issued with regards to certain tax liabilities in Belgium but until the process is finalised, the Group has not released any tax provisions relating to this.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is measured by reference to the cost of foreclosing the swap position at the year end.
The fair value of the senior notes, retail bond and the swaps are measured by reference to observable market interest rate information as no similar instrument is available due to the specific profiles of the loans.
They are considered to be level two in the fair value hierarchy.
None of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps is attributable to changes in the Groups credit risk.
122 Shanks Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Risk management The Group is exposed to market risk interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Group Treasury is charged with managing and controlling risk relating to the financing and liquidity of the Group under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group Treasury does not enter into speculative transactions.
Interest rate risk The Group has continued to limit its exposure to interest rate risk by entering into a fixed rate retail bond of 100m and further interest rate swaps that fix a substantial part of the Groups core borrowings.
The senior notes remain at fixed rates.
The debt relating to project finance non-recourse borrowings is at floating rates and the Group has entered into interest rate swaps.
The interest rate swaps represent a hedge of the interest cash flows.
The interest rate swaps entered into after 31 March 2009 are accounted for under IAS 39 hedge accounting with changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps being recognised directly in reserves as they are effective hedges.
Any other outstanding interest rate swaps have not previously been allocated as hedges by the Group and are therefore classified as held for trading in accordance with IAS 39.
The interest rate swaps are presented in noncurrent liabilities or assets as they are related to long term borrowings and the Group believes this best reflects the commercial reality of the instruments.
The foreign exchange swaps are presented in short term assets and liabilities as the hedge transactions are all due within one year.
Changes in interest rates could have a significant impact on banking covenants relating to interest cover and on the interest charge in the income statement.
The Group manages this risk by fixing the interest rates on a proportion of its total borrowings.
In order to measure the risk, borrowings and the expected interest cost for the year are forecast on a quarterly basis and scenarios run using managements expectations of a reasonably possible change in interest rates.
Interest expense volatility remained within acceptable limits throughout the year.
The Groups exposure has significantly reduced.
The weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted Weighted Floating Fixed average Floating Fixed average rate rate interest rate rate rate interest rate Group % m % % m % Financial assets: Financial assets relating to PFI contracts 51.8 5.8 176.1 5.8 Cash and cash equivalents 40.5 0.4 22.6 0.2 Short term deposits 14.0 0.7 28.7 0.5 Financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts and short term loans 8.2 4.2 2.4 3.1 Senior notes 31.6 6.9 32.0 6.9 Retail bond 87.1 5.0 Bank loans 126.1 2.8 323.5 2.7 Interest rate swaps 109.4 109.4 5.6 307.2 307.2 5.4 Excluded from the analysis above is 8.9m 2010: 13.1m of amounts payable under finance leases as set out in note 23, which are subject to fixed rates of interest.
In addition, trade and other receivables and payables have been excluded as they are not interest bearing.
The average term for short-term deposits is no more than seven days.
For the Company, there were 11.8m short term deposits 2010: 11.9m at an effective interest rate of 0.6% 2010: 0.4%.
The effective interest rate on the Companys cash and cash equivalents was nil% 2010: nil%.
The weighted average effective interest rates relating to the Company were 4.1% 2010: 4.2% for bank loans.
Interest on intercompany loan balances are charged at rates of between 0% and 12% 2010: 0% and 12%.

Foreign exchange risk The Group operates in Europe and Canada and is exposed to foreign exchange risk for movements between the Euro, Canadian Dollar and Sterling.
The majority of the Groups subsidiaries conduct their business in their respective functional currencies: therefore there is limited transaction risk.
Foreign exchange risk arises mainly from net investments in foreign operations.
This exposure is reduced by funding the investments as far as possible with borrowings in the same currency.
The Group applies hedge accounting principles to net investments in foreign operations and the related borrowings.
The Group has designated the carrying value of Euro borrowings of 87.1m 2010: 62.4m fair value of 84.2m 2010: 62.4m as a net investment hedge of the Groups investments denominated in Euros.
The hedge was 100% effective for the year ended 31 March 2011 2010: 100% and as a result the related exchange loss of 0.3m 2010: 4.8m gain on translation of the borrowings into Sterling has been recognised in the exchange reserve.
The Group mitigates some foreign exchange risk on financial assets arising in the UK through the use of forward exchange contracts.

A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group does not have sufficient financial resources to meet its obligations as they fall due.
As well as term borrowings under a syndicated loan facility, the Group maintains uncommitted lending facilities with a range of banks for working capital purposes.
The Group manages liquidity risk by monitoring forecast cash flows to ensure that facility draw-downs are arranged as necessary and an adequate level of headroom is maintained.
The Groups exposure to, and the way it manages liquidity risk has not changed from the previous year.

Each PFI PPP company has loan facilities which are secured by fixed and floating charges on the future cash flows of PFI PPP contracts.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss where counterparties are not able to meet their obligations.
Surplus cash, when not used to repay borrowings, is placed on deposit with banks and money market funds in accordance with a policy that specifies the minimum acceptable credit rating and the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
At 31 March 2011 the amount of credit risk totalled 54.5m 2010: 51.3m.
Credit risk on derivatives where the fair value is positive is closely monitored to ensure that it remains within the limits set for each counterparty.
At 31 March 2011 the credit risk was 0.3m 2010: nil.
Trade and other receivables comprise mainly amounts due from customers for services performed.
Management consider that the exposure to any single customer is not significant and that where credit quality is in doubt, adequate provision has been made for probable losses.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
The financial assets relating to PFI PPP contracts are recoverable from the future revenues relating to these contracts.
Management consider that as the counterparties for the future revenues are UK local authorities or councils, there is minimal credit risk.
Capital risk management The Group has a funding strategy to ensure that the Group maintains an appropriate debt to equity ratio as well as an appropriate debt maturity profile.
The strategy is based on the requirements of the Companys Articles of Association, which state that debt should be limited to three times the level of capital and reserves.
The Groups funding strategy has not changed from the previous year.
The Group has to comply with a number of banking covenants which are set out in the agreements for bank loans and senior notes.
There are financial covenants which are measured using the performance of the core Group, excluding PFI companies and joint ventures, and relate to interest cover, the ratio of debt to EBITDA and the net worth of the Group.
There are other restrictions in the loan documentation concerning acquisitions, disposals, security and other issues.
The Group has complied with its banking covenants.

Retirement benefit schemes continued United Kingdom The Group and Companys principal pension scheme is the Shanks Group Pension Scheme which covers eligible United Kingdom employees and has both funded defined benefit and defined contribution sections.
The Group also has one other small funded defined benefit scheme, which is included in the defined benefit disclosures below.
Pension costs for the defined benefit section are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Assumptions The valuation has been based on a full assessment of the liabilities of the scheme as at 5 April 2009 updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of these schemes at 31 March 2011.
The main assumptions were as follows: 2011 2010 % p. a.
Discount rate 5.6 5.6 Future salary growth non-Local Government Passport Section members 1.0 4.6 Future salary growth Local Government Passport Section members 4.6 4.6 Rate of increase in pensions payment fixed 3% 3.0 3.0 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 5% 3.4 3.4 Rate of increase in pensions payment cap 2.5% 2.2 2.2 Rate of price inflation 3.6 3.6 Consumer price inflation 2.7 n a The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions are that a member currently aged 65 will live on average for a further 22 years if they are male and for a further 24 years if they are female.
For a member who retires in 2026 at age 65 the assumptions are that they will live on average for around a further 24 years after retirement if they are male or for a further 26 years after retirement if they are female.
The assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions.

The Group employs a building block approach in determining the long-term rate of return on pension plan assets.
Historical markets are studied and assets with higher volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The assumed long-term rate of return on each asset class is set out in the table above.
The overall expected rate of return is then derived by aggregating the expected return for each asset class over the actual asset allocation for the schemes as at 31 March 2011.
At 31 March 2011 the IAS 19 net retirement surplus was 4.9m 2010: 6.8m deficit.
The amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased or decreased by 0.25%, the IAS19 asset would increase or decrease by circa 1.8m.

Overseas In the Netherlands, employees are members of either a multi-employer pension scheme or other similar externally funded schemes.
These schemes are treated as defined contribution plans as it is not possible to separately identify the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those schemes.
The Group has been informed by the schemes that it has no obligation to make additional contributions in the event that the schemes have an overall deficit.
In Belgium, the Group operates small defined contribution schemes.
