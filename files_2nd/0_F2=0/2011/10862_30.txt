Financial statements Notes to the Company Accounts Notes to the Company Accounts 139 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The separate accounts of the parent Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006.
The accounts have been prepared under the historic cost convention, except for the recognition of derivative financial instruments and available for sale investments detailed below, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
No profit and loss account is presented by the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The retained profit of the Company for the year is 84.7m 2010: 70.6m.
Leases Leases of tangible fixed assets where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Company are classified as finance leases and the assets are capitalised in the balance sheet as plant and equipment.
Finance leases are capitalised at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Assets acquired under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases of assets where a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Incentives received under operating leases and initial direct costs in negotiating the lease are amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease, or to the first review if shorter.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 3 to 5 years The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable, and are written down immediately to their recoverable amount.
Repairs and maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account during the financial period in which they are incurred.
Investments in subsidiaries Investments are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment.
Available for sale investments Available for sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated as such, or that are not classified as a loan or receivable, held to maturity or at fair value through profit or loss.
After initial recognition these assets are measured at fair value with gains or losses being recognised as a separate component of equity until the investment is derecognised or the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the previously reported cumulative gain or loss is included in the income statement.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as fixed to floating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, fixed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in fair value attributable to the interest rate being hedged.
Notes to the Company Accounts 140 continued 1 Accounting policies continued Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount can be made.
Where the Company expects a provision to be reimbursed the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when reimbursement is virtually certain.
Pensions The Company participates in both the National Express Group multi-employer funded defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis, and therefore has accounted for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme under the requirements of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits.
Share-based payment In accordance with the transition provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company awards equity-settled share-based payment to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant by an external valuer using a stochastic model.
Non-market-based performancerelated vesting conditions are not taken into account when estimating the fair value: instead those non-market conditions are taken into account in calculating the current best estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest and at each balance sheet date before vesting.
The cumulative expense is calculated based on that estimate.
Market-based performance conditions are taken into account when determining the fair value and at each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated irrespective of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are met.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured to fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
In relation to cash flow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in equity, and the ineffective portion in the profit and loss account.
The gains or losses deferred in equity in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or firm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, including the foreign currency contracts, gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 29 for parent company accounts.
The disclosures are included within the consolidated accounts.

Financial statements Notes to the Company Accounts 147 17 Share-based payment During the year ended 31 December 2011, the Company had the following share-based payment arrangements, which are described in note 7 b to the consolidated accounts.
For the following disclosure, share options with a nil exercise price have been disclosed separately to avoid distorting the weighted average exercise prices.
The number of share options in existence during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted Weighted average Number Number average of share exercise price of share exercise price options p options p Options without a nil exercise price: At 1 January 26,724 386 30,759 376 Forfeited during the year 16,544 339 1,600 479 Group transfers during the year 12,511 474 Exercised during the year 2,435 210 Expired during the year 7,656 448 1 Outstanding at 31 December 15,035 479 26,724 386 Exercisable at 31 December 20,045 357 Options with a nil exercise price: At 1 January 3,115,965 nil 1,897,258 nil Granted during the year 2,103,653 nil 1,651,323 nil Forfeited during the year 595,456 nil 20,936 nil Group transfers during the year 220,151 nil nil Exercised during the year 597,633 nil 327,295 nil Expired during the year 427,203 nil 84,385 nil Outstanding at 31 December 3,819,477 nil 3,115,965 nil Exercisable at 31 December 444,461 Total outstanding at 31 December 3,834,512 3,142,689 Total exercisable at 31 December 444,461 20,045 1 Included within this balance are options over nil 2010: 5,774 shares for which no expense has been recognised in accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 20, as the options were granted before 7 November 2002.
Although there has been subsequent modification to the options, no FRS 20 charge has been recognised as the amounts are not material.
There were no options outstanding at 31 December 2011 options in 2010 had exercise prices that were between 207p and 568p excluding options with a nil exercise price.
The range of exercise prices for options was as follows: Exercise price p 2011 2010 0300 6,142 300-600 15,035 20,582 15,035 26,724 The options have a weighted average contractual life of one year 2010: one year.
Options were exercised throughout the year and the weighted average share price at exercise was 244p 2010: 232p.
Notes to the Company Accounts 148 continued 17 Share-based payment continued The weighted average fair value of the remaining share options granted during the year was calculated using a stochastic model, with the following assumptions and inputs: Share options with nil exercise price 2011 2010 Risk free interest rate 1.30%-1.44% 1.8%-3.0% Expected volatility 51.5%-51.6% 52.7% Peer group volatility 55.1%-57.0% 49.6%-50.8% Expected option life in years 3 years 3 years Expected dividend yield 3.47%-3.64% 0% Weighted average share price at grant date 244p 229p Weighted average exercise price at grant date nil nil Weighted average fair value of options at grant date 144p 202p Experience to date has shown that approximately 24% 2010: 15% of options are exercised early, principally due to leavers.
This has been incorporated into the calculation of the expected option life for the share options without nil exercise price.
Expected volatility in the table above was determined from historic volatility over the last nine years, adjusted for one-off events that were not considered to be reflective of the volatility of the share price going forward.
The expected dividend yield represents the dividends declared in the 12 months preceding the date of the grant divided by the average share price in the month preceding the date of the grant.
For share options granted during the year under the LTIP, the TSR targets have been reflected in the calculation of the fair value of the options above.
