Cash Flow and Balance Sheet.
Net debt reduced to 6.8 billion, ahead of our target of 7.0 billion, helped by strong cash generation in the seasonally important second half of the year.
During the year, we repaid 926 million of our debt early and repaid 777 million of maturing bonds.
The strength of our property-backed balance sheet was again demonstrated through continued strong investor demand for our property sale and leaseback transactions during the year.
We expect net debt to fall further in the years ahead.
Looking at our liabilities in the round, we will be focusing more on fixed charge cover as our primary balance sheet metric, which we are targeting to keep between 4 and 4.5 times.
We also are targeting a ratio of 2.5 times lease-adjusted net debt to EBITDAR which represents a similar level to where we were prior to the Homever and TPF acquisitions.
Group capital expenditure in the year was 3.7 billion last year 3.1 billion, a little higher than our expectation at the beginning of the year, mainly as a result of exchange rate movements.
Capital expenditure in the UK was 1.7 billion, with an additional 0.2 billion in the Bank, principally for the re-platforming of our systems, and 1.8 billion in International.
For the 2011 12 year we plan to invest around 4.0 billion in capital expenditure and going forward we expect annual capital expenditure to total between 5% and 5.5% of Group sales.
