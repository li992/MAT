Grants of share options under the Discretionary Approved and Discretionary Schemes the Discretionary Schemes are calculated by reference to base salaries and management grade in the company.
There are two levels of qualification under the Discretionary Schemes.
Level 1 applies to all senior executives including executive directors, Level 2 and deferred share schemes apply to executive directors and sector managing directors.
They are summarised as follows: Level 1: Before the exercise of an option under Level 1, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over the first three consecutive calendar years, commencing in the year in which the option is granted, is at least 4% per annum in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
Failing this, the companys annual growth in earnings per share on average over a greater period up to a maximum of ten years is at least 4% in excess of the UK rate of inflation.
95 Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2011 Notes to the accounts Level 2: The exercise condition under Level 2 is by reference to total shareholder return, i. e. the appreciation of the share price including reinvested dividends in comparison with the performance of the FTSE 100 index and a defined group of support services companies being used as comparators, during three consecutive calendar years commencing in the year in which the option is granted, on the following basis: If the company achieves a median performance in relation to the FTSE 100 index, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile of the FTSE 100 and, in addition, if the company achieves a median performance in the group of support services companies, then 25% of the Level 2 share options will vest, rising pro rata to 50% if the company achieves a performance in the upper quartile in the group of support services companies.

The share price condition was based on the highest average share price of Rentokil Initial plc over any 60 consecutive dealing days during the initial three-year period.
The performance period for the share price element of the award began on 1 April 2008 and ended 61 dealing days following the announcement of the companys results for the financial year ended 31 December 2010.
The annual bonus multiplier measured the extent to which the annual bonus targets had been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2008 awards in the above table reflect that during the first half of 2010 the companys share price achieved a 60 day highest average price of 130.82p.
Participants were entitled to the value of dividends that were paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vested, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The performance conditions for the 2009, 2010 and 2011 awards are total shareholder return TSR and the financial performance bonus multiplier of the group, division or business whichever is applicable to the award holder.
The TSR condition is measured relative to the TSR achieved by constituents of a comparator group, made up of the FTSE 350 companies at the date of grant but excluding financial services and basic resources companies.
The performance period for the share price element of the 2011 award began on 1 April 2011, running to 31 March 2014.
The TSR performance is measured using a three-month average with the start period average being 1 January 2011 to 31 March 2011 and the end period average being 1 January 2014 to 31 March 2014.
The annual bonus multiplier measures the extent to which the annual bonus targets have been achieved in respect of each financial year during the performance period.
The 2009, 2010 and 2011 awards in the above table assume a TSR 96 Rentokil Initial plc Annual report 2011 Financial statements Notes to the accounts performance in the upper quartile or above is reached at the end of the vesting period and that participants achieve their target bonus in each of the three years over the vesting period.
For the 2009 and 2010 awards and the 2011 award to executive directors, no shares will vest if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the vesting period and 200% will vest if the TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain maximum bonus targets.
For the remainder of the 2011 awards no shares will vest if the share price does not reach median TSR performance at the end of the vesting period and 150% will vest if the TSR performance is above the upper quartile and all participants attain maximum bonus targets.
Participants are entitled to the value of dividends that are paid during the vesting period on the number of shares that ultimately vest, in the form of additional shares transferred at the end of the vesting period.
The fair value of the 2011 awards made under the 2006 Performance Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a model developed by Deloitte LLP.
This is a closed-form solution similar to a Monte Carlo simulation which takes account of the correlation between share price performance and the likelihood of a TSR performance condition being met.
The awards were made on two main dates with different valuation characteristics.
For the shares awarded on 22 June 2011, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 95.0p 2010: 127.7p, an expected share price volatility of 52%, a share price correlation of the companies in the comparator group of 26% and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
For the shares awarded on 1 August 2011, the significant inputs into the model were a share price of 91.8p an expected share price volatility of 46%, a share price correlation of the companies in the comparator group of 26% and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices.
As the awards are nil-cost i. e. there is no exercise price, the assumed risk-free rate of return has minimal impact on the fair value of the awards.
Similarly, as dividend equivalents are paid on the vesting portion of awards, the fair value of these awards is not reduced to reflect dividends paid during the vesting period.
The fair value of shares granted during 2011 was 8.8 million 2010: 8.9 million.
2008 Executive Share Plan In 2008 the company also introduced a long-term incentive plan for the chairman, chief executive and one other executive director and granted 22,500,000 shares during the year.

This is measured on the basis of an average share price over any 60 consecutive trading days during the performance measurement period.
Until a minimum share price of 120p per share has been met over a sustained period, no shares are earned.
At 120p per share, 20% of the award is earned, rising on a straight-line basis to full vesting at a share price of 180p per share.
For achieving growth in market value between a share price of 180p per share and 280p per share further shares may be earned up to a maximum of a further 50% of the original award.
The 2008 awards in the same table assume an on target share price of 180p per share is reached at the end of the vesting period.
Up to 1 3 of the award may vest following the end of the third year, another 1 3 following the end of the fourth year and a further 1 3 following the end of the fifth year, based on the extent to which performance targets are achieved.
Any unvested portion of the award following the end of the fifth year will lapse.
See the remuneration report on pages 42 to 51 for further details.
The fair value of the 2008 awards made under the Rentokil Initial 2008 Executive Share Plan is charged to the income statement over the vesting period based on values derived from a bespoke Monte Carlo simulation model.
The significant inputs into the model were a share price of 102p, an expected share price volatility of 21%, an expected dividend yield of 5% per annum and an expected life commensurate with the performance vesting period.
The share price volatility assumption is based on analysis of historical daily share prices measured until October 2007 therefore excluding the significant volatility during the last months of 2007, which the company would not expect going forward.
During the first half of 2010 the companys share price achieved a 60 day highest average price of 130.82p and therefore under the terms of the plan, 34.43% of the award vested with participants receiving a third of the award in May 2011, and being entitled to a second third a year later and the balance in May 2013.
Additional amounts can be earned based on share price appreciation beyond the 130.82p level during the remaining life of the scheme.
