Notes to the parent company accounts Share-based compensation The company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value of options over the companys shares awarded to employees of subsidiary companies is treated as a capital contribution, resulting in an increase in investments.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models, principally Monte Carlo and adjusted Black-Scholes models.
The charge is recognised in the profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award.
At each balance sheet date, the company revises its estimate of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
Any revision to the original estimates is reflected in the profit and loss account with a corresponding adjustment to equity immediately to the extent it relates to past service and the remainder over the rest of the vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the companys shareholders.
