Financial Statements notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 65 p Segmental Reporting Under IFRS 8, Operating Segments, operating segments are considered to be the components of an entity about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the Manager with oversight from the board.
The Directors are of the opinion that the Group has two business segments, being the parent Company, Polar Capital Technology Trust plc, which has the objective of maximising capital growth for its shareholders through investing in a diversified portfolio of technology companies around the world, and its wholly owned subsidiary, PCT Finance Limited, which trades in securities to enhance Group returns.
An analysis of Financial results and balances by business segment is set out in note 30.
The amounts presented for each segment are based on the accounting policies adopted in the Group accounts.
Discrete financial information for these segments is reviewed regularly by the Manager who allocate resources, and the Board who overseas the Managers performance.
In line with IFRS 8, additional disclosure by geographical segment has been provided in note 30.
Further analyses of expenses, investment gains or losses, profit and other assets and liabilities by country have not been given by country have not been given as either it is not possible to prepare such information in a meaningful way or the results are not considered to be significant.
q Key Estimates and Assumptions Estimates and assumptions used in preparing the financial statements are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The results of these estimates and assumptions form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The only estimates and assumptions that may cause material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities relate to the valuation of unquoted investments and investments for which there is an inactive market.
These are valued in accordance with the techniques set out in note 1 g. At the year end, unquoted investments represent 0.2% of net assets.
