If the carrying value of a financial asset is impaired, the carrying value is reduced through a charge to the income statement.
There must be objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events which have occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
Impairment is only recognised if the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash ows of assets held at amortised cost or fair value of assets classied as AFS.
Assets which are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that thecarrying amount may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Table 6 provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets which have been impaired and the ageing analysis ofnancial assets which are past due but not impaired.
Unit linked assets have not been included as shareholders are not exposed to the risks from unit linked policies.
