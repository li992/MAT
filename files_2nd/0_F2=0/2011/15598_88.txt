FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements NOTE 2 SEGMENTAL REPORTING The Groups reporting segments are determined based on the Groups internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been determined to be the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors as it is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM uses trading profit, as reviewed at monthly Executive Committee meetings, as the key measure of the segments results as it reflects the segments underlying trading performance for the financial year under evaluation.
Trading profit is a consistent measure within the Group.
Segmental trading profit is an adjusted measure of operating profit, which measures the performance of each segment before goodwill impairment and restructuring charges, profit arising on property-related items, impact on leases of annual uplifts in rent and rent-free periods, intangible asset amortisation charges and costs arising from acquisitions, adjustments for the fair value of customer loyalty awards and replaces the IAS 19 pension charge with the normal cash contributions for pensions.
Segment assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated is comprised mainly of derivative financial instruments and deferred tax assets.
Inter-segment revenue between the operating segments is not material.
