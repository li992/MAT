In order to maintain or adjust capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Articles of Association of the Company permit borrowing up to three times the adjusted capital and reserves of the Group.
Further, relationships are maintained with a selected group of major international banks to ensure appropriate funding capacity is available.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders.
This process is managed through the Groups budget and longer-term forecasting process.
The Group is required to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio not exceeding 2:1, EBITDA to interest cover of at least 5:1 and to exceed specified minimum trading cash flow limits, in any given period under its revolving credit facilities.
