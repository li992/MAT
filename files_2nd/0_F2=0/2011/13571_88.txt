Rolls-Royce Holdings plc Annual report 2011 93 Financial statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements 8 Intangible assets continued Goodwill In accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets, goodwill is allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs, or groups of CGUs, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill as follows: CGU or group of CGUs Primary reporting 2011 2010 segment m m Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Civil aerospace 230 236 Commercial marine arising from the acquisitions of Vinters plc and Scandinavian Electric Holding AS Marine 645 657 Commercial marine arising from the acquisition of ODIM ASA Marine 112 114 Other Various 112 101 1,099 1,108 Goodwill has been tested for impairment during 2011 on the following basis: The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions.
Given the long-term and established nature of many of the Groups products product lives are often measured in decades, these forecast the next ten years.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the forecasts are based on a range of growth rates 2.0-2.5 per cent that reflect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUs operate.
The key assumptions for the impairment tests are the discount rate and, in the cash flow projections, the programme assumptions, the growth rates and the impact of foreign exchange rates on the relationship between selling prices and costs.
Impairment tests are performed using prevailing exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 13 per cent 2010 13 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The principal value in use assumptions for goodwill balances considered to be individually significant are: Rolls-Royce Deutschland Ltd & Co KG Volume of engine deliveries, flying hours of installed fleet and cost escalation, these are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposure is on translating US dollar income into euros.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent 2010 2.5 per cent.
The directors do not consider that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would cause the value in use of the goodwill to fall below its carrying value.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 75 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Vinters plc Volume of equipment deliveries, capture of aftermarket and cost escalation, these are based on current and known future programmes, estimates of customers fleet requirements and long-term economic forecasts.
The principal foreign exchange exposures are on translating income in a variety of non-functional currencies into Norwegian kroner.
For the purposes of the impairment test only, cash flows beyond the ten-year forecasts are assumed to grow at 2.5 per cent 2010 two per cent.
The overall level of business would need to reduce by more than 80 per cent to cause an impairment of this balance.
Other intangible assets Certification costs and participation fees, development costs and recoverable engine costs have been reviewed for impairment in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Where an impairment test was considered necessary, it has been performed on the following basis: The carrying values have been assessed by reference to value in use.
These have been estimated using cash flows from the most recent forecasts prepared by management, which are consistent with past experience and external sources of information on market conditions over the lives of the respective programmes.
The key assumptions underlying cash flow projections are assumed market share, programme timings, unit cost assumptions, discount rates, and foreign exchange rates.
The pre-tax cash flow projections have been discounted at 11 per cent 2010 11 per cent, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
No impairment is required on this basis.
However, a combination of changes in assumptions and adverse movements in variables that are outside the Groups control discount rate, exchange rate and airframe delays, could result in impairment in future years.
