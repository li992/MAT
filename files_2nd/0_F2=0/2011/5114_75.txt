24 Contingent liabilities easyJet is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business.
Whilst the results of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, management considers that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material effect on easyJets financial position, results or cash flows.
At 30 September 2011 easyJet had outstanding letters of credit and performance bonds totalling 44 million 2010: 32 million, of which 41 million 2010: 28 million expires within one year.
The fair value of these instruments at each year end was negligible.
No amount is recognised on the statement of financial position in respect of any of these financial instruments as it is not probable that there will be an outflow of resources.

easyJets non-current assets principally comprise its fleet of 140 owned and finance-leased aircraft.
A further 64 aircraft are held under operating leases, giving a total fleet of 204 at 30 September 2011.
All of these aircraft are registered in the United Kingdom except for 15 registered in Switzerland.
These assets are used flexibly across the entire route network, and accordingly there is no suitable basis for allocating them to geographic segments.
