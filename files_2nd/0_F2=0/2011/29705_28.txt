Resolutions 11 to 13 are proposed as special resolutions.
This means that for eachof those Resolutions to be passed, at least three-quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the Resolution.
The Directors believe that the proposals set out in this notice are in the best interests of the Companys shareholders as a whole.
Accordingly, the Board other than, in the case of Resolutions 3 to 7, the Director proposed for reappointment in each Resolution, unanimously recommends that members vote in favour of each Resolution.

Resolutions 8 and 9: Auditors The Company is required to appoint Auditors for each financial year of the Company, to hold ofce until the conclusion of the next general meeting at which accounts are presented.
The purpose of these Resolutions is to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as Auditors of the Company and to authorise the Directors to agree the remuneration of the Auditors.
Resolution 10: General power to allot Paragraph A of this Resolution would give the Directors the authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any securities into shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to 101,869,670 representing 101,869,670 ordinary shares.
Thisamount represents approximately one-third of the issued share capital of the Company as at 14 February 2012 excluding treasury shares, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice.

This amount before any reduction represents approximately two-thirds of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company excluding treasury shares as at 14 February 2012, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice.
SVG Capital plc Annual Report 2011 105 The Directors have no present intention to exercise any of the authorities sought under paragraphs A and B of this Resolution.
However, if they do exercise the authorities, the Directors intend to follow recommendations from the Association of British Insurers concerning their use including as regards the Directors standing for re-election in certain cases.

Resolution 11: Notice of general meetings Changes made to the Companies Act 2006 by the Shareholders Rights Regulations increase the notice period required for general meetings of the Company to 21 days unless Shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days.
Annual general meetings will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days notice.
Before the coming into force of the Shareholders Rights Regulations on 3 August 2009, the Company was able to call general meetings other than an annual general meeting on 14 clear days notice without obtaining such shareholder approval.
In order to preserve this ability, Resolution 11 seeks such approval.
The approval will be effective until the Companys next annual general meeting, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
The shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the exibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.
Note that the changes to the Companies Act 2006 mean that, in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days notice, the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.

The Directors intend to exercise the authority referred to in paragraph A of Resolution 12 whenever they believe it is advantageous toshareholders to do so.
The Directors are seeking the authority referred to in paragraph B of Resolution 12 in order to provide exibility in raising monies to take advantage of opportunities arising through the launch of new funds and for general corporate purposes.
It is the intention of the Board that any equity securities allotted under this authority will be allotted at an effective premium to the estimated net asset value pershare at the date of pricing of the issue of the relevant equity securities.
The authority in paragraphs A and B would be limited to allotments or sales in connection with pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those securities or as the Board otherwise considers necessary, or otherwise up to a nominal amount of 15,280,450 representing 15,280,450 shares.
This nominal amount represents approximately 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 14 February 2012, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice.
In respect of this aggregate nominal amount, the Directors confirm their intention to follow the Pre-Emption Groups Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling 3-year period where the Principles provide that usage in excess of 7.5% should not take place without prior consultation with shareholders.
The authority will expire at the earlier of 22 June 2013 and the conclusion of the annual general meeting of the Company held in 2013.
