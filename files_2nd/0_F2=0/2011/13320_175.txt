Financial statements Notes to the accounts Fair value hierarchy of derivative financial instruments For all financial instruments held by the group, those that are held at fair value are to be classified by reference to the source of inputs used to derive the fair value.
The following hierarchy is used: Level 1 unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly as prices or indirectly through modelling based on prices: Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
The group holds all derivatives at fair value using discounted cash flow models based on market rates which are observable.
Therefore all derivative financial instruments and available-for-sale assets held by the group fall into Level 2.
No financial instruments have moved between levels in the year.
