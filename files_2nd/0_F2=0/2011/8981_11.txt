Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36.
Financial risk management continued At 31 December 2011 and 2010 all borrowings were at floating rates.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to interest rate risk is as follows: At 31 December 2011 Non-interest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Non-current investments 8 2 10 Trade and other receivables 190 190 Current investments 810 810 Cash and cash equivalents 401 681 20 1,102 Total financial assets 401 1,499 212 2,112 Financial liabilities Provisions for cash payments 37 37 Borrowings 1,893 1,893 1 Trade and other payables 358 358 Dividends payable 1 1 Total financial liabilities 1,893 37 359 2,289 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and royalties and mineral FYUSBDUJPO tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
At 31 December 2010 Non-interest $ million Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Financial assets Non-current investments 7 2 9 Trade and other receivables 264 264 Current investments 356 356 Cash and cash equivalents 372 709 32 1,113 Total financial assets 372 1,072 298 1,742 Financial liabilities Provisions for cash payments 69 69 Borrowings 1,819 1,819 1 Trade and other payables 312 312 Dividends payable 2 2 Total financial liabilities 1,819 69 314 2,202 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and royalties and mineral FYUSBDUJPO tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The interest charged on floating rate financial liabilities is based on the relevant benchmark rate such as LIBOR.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of interest rates has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in interest rates or outstanding borrowings over the course of a period of time.
In addition, the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
The effect on profit after tax of a 1% movement in US$ LIBOR rates, based on the year-end net funds position and with all other variables held constant, is estimated to be $9 million 2010: $9 million.
f Credit risk Exposure to credit risk arises as a result of transactions in the Groups ordinary course of business and is applicable to all financial assets.
Investments in cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments are with approved counter-party banks and other financial institutions in accordance with the Groups Treasury Policy.
Counterparties are assessed prior to, during, and after the conclusion of transactions to ensure exposure to credit risk is limited to an acceptable level.
The maximum exposure with respect to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
Credit risk relating to trade receivables Given the number and geographical spread of the Groups ultimate customers and the solvency of major trade debtors, credit risk is believed to be limited in respect of trade receivables.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise this exposure.
Customer credit risk is managed by each division but is subject to Group oversight to ensure that each divisions customer credit risk management system operates in a prudent and responsible manner.
Credit evaluations are performed for all major customers and credit limits are established based on internal or external rating criteria.
The credit quality of the Groups significant customers is monitored on an on-going basis, and receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are considered of good credit quality.
Letters of credit are obtained where customer credit quality is not considered strong enough for open credit.
There were no material impairments of trade receivables during the year ended 31 December 2011 or 2010.
The solvency of the debtor and their ability to repay the receivables were considered in assessing the impairment of such assets.
Within Kazakhmys Mining, cash is received prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods for sales to European customers.
Sales to Chinese customers are made under letters of credit which are obtained prior to delivery and transfer of title of the goods.
Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 184 6 Payment from European and Chinese customers is subject to provisional pricing and then final pricing adjustments.
Kazakhmys Mining is therefore exposed to the residual final pricing adjustment for each sales transaction although such amounts are not considered material in the context of the Groups overall revenues.
Kazakhmys Mining also provides certain social services to municipal authorities in the communities in which it operates as part of its contractual obligations under its subsoil licences.
For most receivable balances due from municipal authorities, full provision is recognised in light of past payment history.
MKM has put in place credit insurance for the majority of its sales and credit limits are set by the credit insurance company depending on the financial strength and location of each customer.
For those sales where credit insurance is not available, short payment terms and regular dialogue with customers ensures credit risk is kept to a minimum.
As at 31 December 2011, 10 2010: 10 customers accounted for 87% 2010: 80% of the trade and other receivables balance of Kazakhmys Mining.
By 22 March 2012, 98% 23 March 2011: 98% of year-end balances due from these customers had been received in full.
i Risk for trade receivables by geographical regions The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at 31 December by geographic areas was: $ million 2011 2010 Europe 24 79 China 121 135 Kazakhstan 34 41 Other 11 9 190 264 ii Impairment losses The ageing of trade receivables at 31 December was: 2011 2010 $ million Gross Impairment Gross Impairment Not past due 178 213 Past due 0-90 days 10 2 41 1 Past due 91-180 days 2 1 10 1 Past due 181-270 days 4 1 4 2 More than 270 days 58 58 55 55 252 62 323 59 The movement in the provision for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: $ million 2011 2010 At 1 January 59 52 Charged to income statement 6 7 Written off 3 At 31 December 62 59 iii Credit risk related to financial instruments and cash deposits Credit risk relating to the Groups other financial assets, comprising principally cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments arises from the potential default of counterparties.
Credit risk arising from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed by the Groups Treasury Committee in accordance with a Board approved Treasury Policy.
Investment of cash and deposits are made only with approved counterparties of high credit worthiness and within credit limits assigned to each counterparty.
In order to manage counterparty and liquidity risk, surplus funds within the Group are held predominantly in the UK and funds remaining in Kazakhstan are utilised mainly for working capital purposes, with the funds in the UK being held primarily with major European and US financial institutions with minimum ratings of Standard & Poors Aand Moodys A3 and AAA rated liquidity funds.
These limits are reviewed on a regular basis to take account of developments in financial markets and updated accordingly.
The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risks and therefore mitigate any financial loss through potential counterparty failure.
No material exposure is considered to exist by virtue of the possible non-performance of the counterparties to derivative financial instruments.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at 31 December was: $ million 2011 2010 Non-current investments 10 9 Trade and other receivables 190 264 Current investments 810 356 Cash and cash equivalents 1,102 1,113 2,112 1,742 www.
com 185 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 36.
Financial risk management continued g Liquidity risk The Group maintains a balance between availability of funding and maximising investment return on its liquid resources through the use of liquid cash investments of varying maturities, credit facilities and longer term debt instruments.
Management regularly reviews the funding requirements of the Group in selecting appropriate maturities for its liquid cash investments.
In the event that bank term deposits in Kazakhstan need to be liquidated at short notice in advance of their contracted maturity date, the terms of these investments permit their immediate conversion to cash, and in some instances, the forfeiture of interest accrued to the date of liquidation.
The Groups policy is to centralise debt and surplus cash balances to the maximum extent possible.

Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 186 6 h Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Set out below is a comparison by class of the carrying amounts and fair value of the Groups financial instruments that are carried in the financial statements.
2011 2010 Carrying $ million value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Non-current investments 10 10 9 9 Trade and other receivables 190 190 264 264 Current investments 810 810 356 356 Cash and cash equivalents 1,102 1,102 1,113 1,113 Provisions for cash payments 37 37 69 69 Borrowings 1,893 1,867 1,819 1,819 1 Trade and other payables 358 358 312 312 Dividends payable 1 1 2 2 177 151 460 460 1 Trade and other payables exclude payments received in advance, other taxes payable and royalties and mineral extraction tax payable that are not regarded as financial instruments.
The fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: cash and cash equivalents, current investments, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and dividends payable approximate to their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments: provisions for cash payments are discounted back to their present value: and the fair value of borrowings is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt and remaining maturities.
i Capital management The over-riding objectives of the Groups capital management policy are to safeguard and support the business as a going concern through the commodity cycle and to maintain an optimal capital structure with a view to maximising returns to shareholders either through ordinary or special dividends, or share buy-backs and benefits to other stakeholders by reducing the Groups cost of capital.
At 31 December 2011, total capital employed which comprises equity holders funds, non-controlling interests and borrowings of the Group amounted to $10,725 million, compared to $10,038 million at 31 December 2010.
Total capital employed is the measure of capital that is used by the Directors in managing capital.
At 31 December 2011, the Group is in a net funds position from continuing operations of $19 million 2010: net debt of $350 million.
The Group manages net debt to ensure that it does not exceed two times normalised EBITDA through the commodity cycle, where normalised EBITDA excludes special items and equity accounted earnings from ENRC and Ekibastuz GRES-1 LLP from 27 February 2010.
Included within the debt facilities are financial covenants related to maximum borrowing levels determined by reference to net debt to EBITDA and debt to equity ratios and minimum tangible net worth for which compliance certificates are produced.
All financial covenants were fully complied with during the year and up to the date of approval of the financial statements.
There are no covenants under negotiation at present.
Commitments and contingencies a Legal claims In the ordinary course of business, the Group is subject to legal actions and complaints.
The Directors believe that the ultimate liability, if any, arising from such actions or complaints will not have a materially adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the Group.
As of 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Group was not involved in any significant legal proceedings, including arbitration, other than those involving the taxation matters set out below.
b Kazakhstan taxation contingencies i Inherent uncertainties in interpreting tax legislation The Group is subject to uncertainties relating to the determination of its tax liabilities.
Kazakhstan tax legislation and practice are in a state of continuous development and, therefore, are subject to varying interpretations and changes which may be applied retrospectively.
The Directors interpretation of tax legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the Group may not coincide with that of the tax authorities.
As a result, the tax authorities may challenge transactions and the Group may be assessed with additional taxes, penalties and fines which could have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position and results of operations.
ii Kazakhmys Mining tax audits During 2010 and 2011, a tax audit for the years 2006 to 2008 was undertaken at Kazakhmys LLC whose scope included corporate income tax, environmental taxes and other taxes charged to the income statement.
The tax audit was completed and a final assessment issued in October 2011, which resulted in a claim against Kazakhmys LLC in excess of the amounts previously paid.
The Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle these claims.
The risk exists that the ultimate settlement will exceed the Directors estimation.
The tax computations for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 remain open for inspection during a future tax audit.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements for these years may be subject to change.
com 187 Financial Statements Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 37.
Commitments and contingencies continued iii Kazakhmys Mining transfer pricing In June 2010, amendments to Kazakhstans transfer pricing legislation were passed into law and were made largely retrospective from 1 January 2009.
The new legislation clarified certain areas of interpretation, including the use of LME and LBMA prices as the basis of market prices, quotation periods to be used for the sale and purchase of traded commodities and the acceptability of discounts with reference to LME LBMA prices when transacting in traded commodities.
Notwithstanding these amendments, the Directors have recognised a provision for the amounts that represent the Directors best estimate of the probable cash payments that will be required to settle any residual transfer pricing exposures based on the Directors interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation including the impact of the amendments passed into law in June 2010 and the prevailing status of discussions with the tax authorities.
The risk remains that the tax authorities may take a different position with regards to the interpretation of the new transfer pricing legislation, and amendments thereof, and the outcome of discussions with the Kazakhstan tax authorities may be materially different from the Directors expectations.
iv Kazakhmys Mining excess profits tax New tax legislation came into force in Kazakhstan on 1 January 2009 which removed the tax stabilisation of subsoil use contracts and changed the excess profits tax methodology.
Based on production and material flows within Kazakhmys LLC for the periods subsequent to 31 December 2008, the Directors interpretation of the new tax legislation is that excess profits tax should no longer be levied on Kazakhmys LLCs operations after 1 January 2009.
The Directors position is supported by discussions and correspondence with the Government authorities.
However, at 31 December 2011, the risk remained that the tax authorities may take a different position with regards to the interpretation of the new legislation and seek to impose excess profits tax on Kazakhmys LLCs operations for the years subsequent to 2008.
In October 2011, the Supreme Court of Kazakhstan issued a ruling that Kazakhmys LLC should not have been liable for excess profits tax in the periods up to and including 2008.
Following this ruling as well as the results of two previous tax audits for the years 2003 to 2008, where the tax authorities have confirmed Kazakhmys LLCs methodology in calculating its excess profits taxation liabilities by making no further claims, the Group has released the excess profits tax provision of $49 million including fines and penalties that was recognised in earlier years.
The provision was recognised previously due to the uncertainties over the judgements that were made in respect of Kazakhmys LLCs methodology of computing excess profits tax in periods up to and including 2008.
Consequently, the Directors believe that the likelihood of further liabilities or exposures existing in respect of excess profits tax for the periods up to and including 2008 is remote.
v Period for additional tax assessments The tax authorities in Kazakhstan are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the end of the relevant tax period in respect of all taxes, except for excess profits tax.
In respect of excess profits tax, they are able to raise additional tax assessments for five years after the expiration of the terms of the relevant subsoil contract.
vi Possible additional tax liabilities The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Kazakhstan and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
However, due to the reasons set out above, the risk remains that the relevant tax authorities may take a differing position with regard to the interpretation of contractual provisions or tax law.
The resulting effect of this matter is that additional tax liabilities may arise.
However, due to the range of uncertainties described above in assessing any potential additional tax liabilities, it is not practicable for the Directors to estimate the financial effect in terms of the amount of additional tax liabilities, if any, together with any associated penalties and charges for which the Group may be liable.
c UK taxation contingencies i Status of tax audits No tax audits have been commissioned for the UK companies, however the tax computations for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 remain open to enquiry by the tax authorities until 31 January 2012 and 31 December 2012, respectively.
Consequently, the tax figures recorded in the financial statements as they may relate to the tax computations for the years ended 31 December 2009 and 31 December 2010 may be subject to change.
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in the UK and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
ii Transfer pricing The Directors believe the Group is in substantial compliance with regards to UK transfer pricing legislation as an appropriate profit margin has been generated within the UK sales operation since its formation at the time of Listing to cover the transfer of risks and rewards from Kazakhstan to the UK.
d Insurance The insurance industry in Kazakhstan is in a developing state and many forms of insurance protection common in other parts of the world are not yet generally available.
The Group has purchased a catastrophic insurance programme in the London market to mitigate the effect of the loss or damage of certain of its assets located at its facilities and the resultant business interruption, although such a programme may not provide full cover in the event of a major loss.
The Group does not have material third party liability coverage in respect of property or environmental damage arising from accidents on Group property or relating to Group operations.
There is a risk that the loss or destruction of certain assets could have a material adverse effect on the Groups operations and financial position.
e Environmental contingencies Environmental regulations in Kazakhstan are continually evolving and new emissions legislation is expected to be introduced in the near future.
The outcome of environmental regulations under proposal or any future environmental legislation cannot be reliably estimated at present.
As obligations are determined, they will be provided for in accordance with the Groups accounting policies.
The Directors believe that there are no significant liabilities under current legislation not accrued for in the Groups consolidated financial statements, however Kazakhmys Annual Report and Accounts 2011 188 6 recognise that any future changes in legislation may have a significant impact on the Groups results.
The provision that has been made for costs associated with restoration and abandonment of mine sites upon depletion of deposits see note 32, is based upon the estimation of the Groups specialists.
Where events occur that change the level of estimated future costs for these activities, the provision will be adjusted accordingly.
f Use of subsoil and exploration rights In Kazakhstan, all subsoil reserves belong to the State, with the Ministry of Industry and New Technologies the Ministry granting exploration and production rights to third party bodies.
Subsoil and exploration rights are not granted in perpetuity, and any renewal must be agreed before the expiration of the relevant contract or licence.
These rights may be terminated by the Ministry if the Group does not satisfy its contractual obligations.
The current subsoil rights will expire at varying dates up to 2062. g Other commitments The table below sets out the Groups expenditure commitments in property, plant and equipment as at 31 December 2011 and 2010: $ million 2011 2010 Property, plant and equipment 148 155 The Group has capital expenditure commitments for the purchase of property, plant and equipment as well as commitments under its mining subsoil agreements, and the petroleum exploration licence in the prior period.
Committed expenditure under these subsoil agreements relates to investments in community-related projects, and includes investments in social sphere assets, infrastructure and public utilities.
h Operating lease commitments The operating lease expense for the year was $4 million 2010: $4 million.
At 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Group had the following total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases: $ million 2011 2010 Within one year 4 5 After one year but not more than five years 22 23 More than five years 57 59 83 87 i Discontinued operations German taxation contingencies i Status of tax audits In 2007 the German tax authorities finalised a tax audit of MKM for the years 1999 to 2002.
The tax audit for the years from 2003 to 2005 is currently underway and the years 2006 to 2010 remain open for inspection.
The Directors believe that the Group is in substantial compliance with the tax laws promulgated in Germany and any contractual terms entered into that relate to tax which affect its operations and that, consequently, no additional material tax liabilities will arise.
Related party disclosures a Transactions with related parties Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note.
Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties are disclosed below.
The following table provides the total amount of transactions which have been entered into with related parties for the relevant financial period: Amounts Amounts Sales to Purchases owed by owed to related from related related related $ million parties parties parties parties 1 Companies under trust management 2011 13 7 52 2010 13 8 47 2 1 Other 2011 2 25 10 1 2010 3 23 7 2 1 A provision of $53 million 2010: $47 million has been set against the amounts owed by related parties.
The bad debt expense in relation to related parties was $6 million for the period 2010: $4 million.
i Government Share ownership in the Company On 24 July 2008, the Company issued 80,286,050 ordinary shares to the State Property and Privatisation Committee of the Government, thereby making the Government a 15% shareholder of the Company and a related party with effect from this date.
On 4 October 2010, the Groups Chairman, Vladimir Kim, sold 58,876,793 ordinary shares, approximately 11.0% of Kazakhmys shares in issue, to Samruk-Kazyna.
As a result of the transaction, the Governments interest in the Group increased to 139,162,843 ordinary shares, representing approximately 26.0% of the shares in issue.
The Governments interest is held via The State Property & Privatisation Committees existing 15.0% holding and the 11.0% shareholding of Samruk-Kazyna.
Following the purchase of 5,559,710 of the Companys shares under the share buy-back programme which commenced in September 2011, the Governments shareholding has increased to 26.3% as at 31 December 2011. www.
