com 63 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 General information John Wood Group PLC, its subsidiaries and joint ventures provide services to the oil and gas and power generation industries around the world.
Details of the Groups activities during the year are provided in the Operational Review.
John Wood Group PLC is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in Scotland and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
Accounting Policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations adopted by the European Union EU and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Group financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through the income statement.
Prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the reclassification of discontinued operations and their presentation in the income statement.
Significant accounting policies The Groups significant accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements are the result of the consolidation of the financial statements of the Groups subsidiary undertakings from the date of acquisition or up until the date of divestment as appropriate.
Subsidiaries are entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies and generally accompanies a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
The Groups interests in joint ventures are accounted for using proportional consolidation.
Under this method the Group includes its share of each joint ventures income, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis in the consolidated financial statements.
Transactions between Group subsidiaries are eliminated and transactions between the Group and its joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint venture.
All Group companies apply the Groups accounting policies and prepare financial statements to 31 December.
Critical accounting judgements and estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year.
These estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions and actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities are addressed below.
a Impairment of goodwill The Group carries out impairment reviews whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.
In addition, the Group carries out an annual impairment review.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of goodwill is less than the carrying amount.
The impairment tests are carried out by CGU Cash Generating Unit and reflect the latest Group budgets.
The budgets are based on various assumptions relating to the Groups businesses including oil and gas prices, resource utilisation, foreign exchange rates, contract awards and contract margins.
b Revenue recognition Revenue on lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed-price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs.
Use of the percentage of completion method requires the use of estimates in assessing the stage of completion reached.
c Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Functional currency The Groups earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the principal functional currency is the US dollar, being the most representative currency of the Group.
The Groups financial statements are therefore prepared in US dollars.
The following exchange rates have been used in the preparation of these accounts: 2011 2010 Average rate 1 $ 1.6041 1.5459 Closing rate 1 $ 1.5541 1.5657 64 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 Accounting Policies continued Foreign currencies Income statements of entities whose functional currency is not the US dollar are translated into US dollars at average rates of exchange for the period and assets and liabilities are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of net assets in such entities held at the beginning of the year, together with those differences resulting from the restatement of profits and losses from average to year end rates, are taken to the currency translation reserve.
In each individual entity, transactions in overseas currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of the transaction.
Where more than one exchange rate is available, the appropriate rate at which assets can be readily realised and liabilities can be extinguished is used.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Any exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The directors consider it appropriate to record sterling denominated equity share capital in the accounts of John Wood Group PLC at the exchange rate ruling on the date it was raised.
Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Groups activities.
Revenue is recognised only when it is probable that the economic benefits associated with a transaction will flow to the Group and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Revenue from services is recognised as the services are rendered, including where they are based on contractual rates per man hour in respect of multi-year service contracts.
Incentive performance revenue is recognised upon completion of agreed objectives.
Revenue from product sales is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, which is normally upon delivery of products and customer acceptance, if any.
Revenue is stated net of sales taxes such as VAT and discounts.
Revenue on lump sum contracts for services, construction contracts and fixed-price long-term service agreements is recognised according to the stage of completion reached in the contract by measuring the proportion of costs incurred for work performed to total estimated costs.
An estimate of the profit attributable to work completed is recognised once the outcome of the contract can be estimated reliably.
Expected losses are recognised in full as soon as losses are probable.
The net amount of costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less the sum of recognised losses and progress billings is disclosed as trade receivables trade payables.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those significant items which are separately disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items include gains and losses on divestment of businesses, write downs or impairments of assets including goodwill, restructuring costs or provisions, litigation settlements, acquisition costs and one-off gains and losses arising from currency devaluations.
Finance expense income Interest income and expense is recorded in the income statement in the period to which it relates.
Arrangement fees in respect of the Groups borrowing facilities are amortised over the period to which the facility relates.
Interest relating to the discounting of deferred and contingent consideration liabilities is recorded as finance expense.

com 65 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 Accounting Policies continued Dividends Dividends to the Groups shareholders are recognised as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders.
Goodwill The Group uses the purchase method of accounting to account for acquisitions.
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Acquisition costs relating to business combinations prior to 31 December 2009 were treated as part of the cost of the acquisition and capitalised as goodwill.
In accordance with IFRS 3 revised, acquisition costs relating to business combinations completed on or after 1 January 2010 are expensed in the income statement.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will be future economic benefits attributable to the asset, the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately identifiable and there is control over the use of the asset.
Where the Group acquires a business, intangible assets on acquisition such as customer contracts are identified and evaluated to determine the carrying value on the acquisition balance sheet.
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, as follows: Software and development costs 3 5 years Intangible assets on acquisition 3 10 years Property plant and equipment Property plant and equipment PP&E is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
No depreciation is charged with respect to freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Transfers from PP&E to current assets are undertaken at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the assets: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 25 50 years Short leasehold buildings period of lease Plant and equipment 3 10 years When estimating the useful life of an asset group, the principal factors the Group takes into account are the durability of the assets, the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used and the expected rate of technological developments.
Impairment The Group performs impairment reviews in respect of PP&E and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
In addition, the Group carries out annual impairment reviews in respect of goodwill.
An impairment loss is recognised when the recoverable amount of an asset, which is the higher of the assets fair value less costs to sell and its value in use, is less than its carrying amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating unit CGU.
The CGUs are aligned to the structure the Group uses to manage its business.
Cash flows are discounted in determining the value in use.
66 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 Accounting Policies continued Inventories Inventories, which include materials, work in progress and finished goods and goods for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Service-based companies inventories consist of spare parts and other consumables.
Serialised parts are costed using the specific identification method and other materials are generally costed using the first in, first out method.
Product-based companies determine cost by weighted average cost methods using standard costing to gather material, labour and overhead costs.
These costs are adjusted, where appropriate, to correlate closely the standard costs to the actual costs incurred based on variance analysis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and estimated selling expenses.
Allowance is made for obsolete and slow-moving items, based upon annual usage.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand and other short-term bank deposits with maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts where there is a right of set-off.
Bank overdrafts are included within borrowings in current liabilities where there is no right of set-off.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The provision is determined by reference to previous experience of recoverability for receivables in each market in which the Group operates.
Trade payables Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Deferred and contingent consideration Where it is probable that deferred or contingent consideration is payable on the acquisition of a business based on an earn-out arrangement, an estimate of the amount payable is made at the date of acquisition and reviewed regularly thereafter, with any change in the estimated liability being reflected in the income statement.
Changes in the estimated liability in respect of acquisitions completed before 31 December 2009 are reflected in goodwill.
Changes in the estimated liability in respect of acquisitions completed after 31 December 2009 are expensed in the income statement.
Where deferred consideration is payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
Taxation The tax charge represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the profit reported in the income statement due to items that are not taxable or deductible in any period and also due to items that are taxable or deductible in a different period.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided, using the full liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The principal temporary differences arise from depreciation on PP&E, tax losses carried forward and, in relation to acquisitions, the difference between the fair values of the net assets acquired and their tax base.
Tax rates enacted, or substantially enacted, at the balance sheet date are used to determine deferred tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
com 67 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 Accounting Policies continued Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as either: 1 hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : 2 hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedge : or 3 hedges of net investments in foreign operations net investment hedge.
Where hedging is to be undertaken, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge transaction.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged items.
The Group performs effectiveness testing on a quarterly basis.
a Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in administrative expenses in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
b Cash flow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in the hedging reserve in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled through the income statement in periods when the hedged item affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
c Net investment hedge Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in the currency translation reserve in equity: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
d Derivatives that are not designated as hedges Certain derivatives, whilst providing effective economic hedges, are not designated as hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Fair value estimation The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of their estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward foreign exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of all derivative financial instruments are obtained from valuations provided by financial institutions.
The carrying values of trade receivables and payables approximate to their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
68 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 Accounting Policies continued Operating leases As lessee Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the period of lease.
As lessor Operating lease rental income arising from leased assets is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Retirement benefit liabilities The Group operates a defined benefit scheme and a number of defined contribution schemes.
The liability recognised in respect of the defined benefit scheme represents the present value of the defined benefit obligations less the fair value of the scheme assets.
The assets of this scheme are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The defined benefit schemes assets are measured using market values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured annually by an independent actuary using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit scheme expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the scheme assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in finance income expense.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which they occur.
The defined benefit schemes net assets or net liabilities are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The Groups contributions to defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the period to which the contributions relate.
Provisions Provision is made for the estimated liability on all products and services still under warranty, including claims already received, based on past experience.
Other provisions are recognised where the Group is deemed to have a legal or constructive obligation, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Where amounts provided are payable after more than one year the estimated liability is discounted using an appropriate rate of interest.
com 69 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 Accounting Policies continued Share-based charges relating to employee share schemes The Group has a number of employee share schemes: i Share options granted under Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS are granted at market value.
A charge is booked to the income statement as an employee benefit expense for the fair value of share options expected to be exercised, accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is taken to retained earnings.
The fair value is calculated using an option pricing model.
ii Share options granted under the Long-Term Retention Plan LTRP are granted at par value.
The charge to the income statement for LTRP shares is also calculated using an option pricing model and, as with ESOS grants, the fair value of the share options expected to be exercised is accrued over the vesting period.
The corresponding credit is also taken to retained earnings.
iii The Group has a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP for executive directors and certain senior executives.
Participants are awarded shares dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement for shares awarded under the LTIP is based on the fair value of those shares at the grant date, spread over the vesting period.
For those awards that have a market related performance measure, the fair value of the market related element is calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
iv The Group has a Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP for senior management.
Participants are paid a cash bonus dependent on the achievement of performance targets.
The charge to the income statement is based on the fair value of the awards at the balance sheet date.
The charge is spread over the vesting period with the corresponding credit being recorded in liabilities.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Share capital John Wood Group PLC has one class of ordinary shares and these are classified as equity.
Dividends on ordinary shares are not recognised as a liability or charged to equity until they have been approved by shareholders.
The Group is deemed to have control of the assets, liabilities, income and costs of its employee share trusts, therefore they have been consolidated in the financial statements of the Group.
Shares acquired by and disposed of by the employee share trusts are recorded at cost.
The cost of shares held by the employee share trusts is deducted from equity.
Segmental reporting The Group has determined that its operating segments are based on management reports reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM, the Groups Chief Executive.
Following the acquisition of PSN and the divestment of the Well Support division the Groups reportable segments are now Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS.
Management considers these segments to be the most appropriate in light of the change in the structure of the Group.
Comparative figures have been restated to reflect the change to operating segments.
The CODM measures the operating performance of these segments using EBITA Earnings before interest, tax and amortisation.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal management reports provided to the CODM who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
Engineering offers a wide range of services to the upstream, subsea and pipelines, downstream and industrial, and clean energy sectors.
These include conceptual studies, engineering, project and construction management EPCM and control system upgrades.
Wood Group PSN offers life of field support to producing assets through brownfield engineering and modifications, production enhancement, operations and management including UK dutyholder services, training, maintenance management and abandonment services.
Wood Group GTS is an independent provider of rotating equipment services and solutions for clients in the power, oil and gas and clean energy markets.
Aftermarket maintenance activities include facility operations and maintenance, repair and overhaul of gas, wind and steam turbines, pumps and other high speed rotating equipment.
The Power Solutions business provides power plant engineering, procurement and construction and construction management services to the owners of power generation facilities.

The impairment tests were carried out on a Cash Generating Unit CGU basis using the 2012-13 budgets.
Cash flows for 2014-16 are assumed to grow at a rate of 5% per annum and subsequent cash flows have been assumed to grow at 3% per annum for a further 15 years reflecting expected long-term growth rates in the countries in which the Group operates.
Management believe that 5% is an appropriate growth rate to use for the markets in which the Group operates.
Details of other key assumptions used are included in critical accounting judgements and estimates in the Accounting Policies.
In total, a 20 year period has been used for the impairment tests reflecting the expected long-term growth in the market.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.
com 79 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The value in use has been compared to the net book value of goodwill for each CGU to assess whether an impairment write-down is required.
$46.2m of goodwill has been impaired during the year.
See note 4 for further details.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the basis that the expected long-term growth rate falls to 2% and that the pre-tax discount rate increases to 12% in order to assess the impact of reasonable possible changes to the assumptions used in the impairment review.
This analysis did not identify any further CGUs requiring to be impaired.

At 31 December 2011 the Groups bank facilities relating to the issue of bonds, guarantees and letters of credit amounted to $797.1m 2010: $665.2m.
At 31 December 2011, these facilities were 51% utilised 2010: 61%.

86 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 17 Financial instruments The Groups activities give rise to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy is to hedge exposures wherever practicable in order to minimise any potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
Risk management is carried out by the Group Treasury department in line with the Groups Treasury policies.
Group Treasury, together with the Groups business units identify, evaluate and where appropriate, hedge financial risks.
The Groups Treasury policies cover specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, use of derivative financial instruments and investment of excess cash.
Where the Board considers that a material element of the Groups profits and net assets are exposed to a country in which there is significant geopolitical uncertainty a strategy is agreed to ensure that the risk is minimised.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currencies.
The Group has a number of subsidiary companies whose revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the US dollar.
Where practical, the Group hedges part of its net investment in non-US dollar subsidiaries by using foreign currency bank loans.
Other strategies, including the payment of dividends, are used to minimise the amount of net assets exposed to foreign currency revaluation.
Some of the revenues of the Groups businesses are to customers in overseas locations.
Where possible, the Groups policy is to eliminate all significant currency exposures on revenues at the time of the transaction by using financial instruments such as forward currency contracts.
Changes in the forward contract fair values are booked through the income statement, except where hedge accounting is used in which case the change in fair value is recorded in equity.
The Group carefully monitors the economic and political situation in the countries in which it operates to ensure appropriate action is taken to minimise any foreign currency exposure.
The Groups main foreign exchange risk relates to movements in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
Movements in the sterling US dollar rate impact the translation of sterling profit earned in the UK and the translation of sterling denominated net assets.
If the average sterling US dollar rate had been 10% higher or lower during 2011 2010:10%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $10.6m higher or lower 2010: $6.9m.
If the closing sterling US dollar rate was 10% higher or lower at 31 December 2011 2010:10%, exchange differences in equity would have been $28.8m 2010: $18.3m higher or lower respectively.
10% has been used in these calculations as it represents a reasonable possible change in the sterling US dollar exchange rate.
ii Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps into fixed rates to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The Groups long-term policy is to maintain approximately 50% of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest.
At 31 December 2011, 47% 2010 : 57% of the Groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking account of interest rate swaps.
The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk on cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to maximise the return on cash deposits whilst ensuring that cash is deposited with a financial institution with a credit rating of A or better, where possible.
If average interest rates had been 1% higher or lower during 2011 2010:1%, post-tax profit for the year would have been $1.3m higher or lower respectively 2010: $1.2m.
1% has been used in this calculation as it represents a reasonable possible change in interest rates.
iii Price risk The Group is not exposed to any significant price risk in relation to its financial instruments.
com 87 : Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 17 Financial instruments continued b Credit risk The Groups credit risk primarily relates to its trade receivables.
The Groups operations comprise three divisions Engineering, Wood Group PSN and Wood Group GTS each made up of a number of businesses.
Responsibility for managing credit risks lies within the businesses with support being provided by Group and divisional management where appropriate.
A customer evaluation is typically obtained from an appropriate credit rating agency.
Where required, appropriate trade finance instruments such as letters of credit, bonds, guarantees and credit insurance will be used to manage credit risk.
The Groups major customers are typically large companies which have strong credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
Where a customer does not have sufficiently strong credit ratings, alternative forms of security such as the trade finance instruments referred to above may be obtained.
The Group has a broad customer base and management believe that no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the provision for impairment of trade receivables.
Management review trade receivables across the Group based on receivable days calculations to assess performance.
There is significant management focus on receivables that are overdue.
A table showing trade receivables and receivable days by division is provided in note 12.
Receivable days calculations are not provided on non-trade receivables as management do not believe that this information is a relevant metric.
The Group also has credit risk in relation to cash held on deposit.
The Groups policy is to deposit cash at institutions with a credit rating of A or better where possible.
74% of cash held on deposit at 31 December 2011 2010 : 100% was held with such institutions.
c Liquidity risk With regard to liquidity, the Groups main priority is to ensure continuity of funding.
At 31 December 2011, 91% 2010 : 94% of the Groups borrowing facilities excluding joint ventures were due to mature in more than one year.
Based on the current outlook the Group has sufficient funding in place to meet its future obligations.
d Capital risk The Group seeks to maintain an optimal capital structure.
The Group monitors its capital structure on the basis of its gearing ratio, interest cover and when applicable, the ratio of net debt to EBITDA.
Gearing is calculated by dividing net debt by equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Interest cover is calculated by dividing EBITA from continuing operations by net finance expense from continuing operations before exceptional items.
Interest cover for the year to 31 December 2011 was 38.8 times 2010: 6.5 times.
The ratio of net debt to continuing EBITDA at 31 December 2011 was 0.01 times 2010: 0.04 times.
88 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 17 Financial instruments continued The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period from the balance sheet to the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows.
Drawdowns under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and are not therefore discounted.
Less than Between 1 Between 2 Over 1 year and 2 years and 5 years 5 years At 31 December 2011 $m $m $m $m Borrowings 69.2 161.3 Trade and other payables 1,199.3 Other non-current liabilities 28.5 70.2 At 31 December 2010 Borrowings 30.1 165.1 Trade and other payables 1,055.2 Other non-current liabilities 27.9 56.8 Fair value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities The fair value of short-term borrowings, trade and other payables, trade and other receivables, short-term deposits and cash at bank and in hand approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of interest rates in respect of these instruments.
Drawdowns under long-term bank facilities are for periods of three months or less and as a result, book value and fair value are considered to be the same.
Details of derivative financial instruments are not disclosed in the financial statements as they are not material.

They are based on previous claims history and it is expected that most of the costs in respect of these provisions will be incurred over the next two years.
Other provisions At 31 December 2011, other provisions of $75.6m 2010 : $20.5m have been recognised.
This amount includes provisions for future losses on onerous contracts, a provision for non-recoverable indirect taxes and provisions relating to the divestment of businesses.
It is expected that any payment required in respect of these provisions would be made within the next two years.
19 Deferred tax Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using the tax rate applicable to the territory in which the asset or liability has arisen.
Deferred tax in relation to UK companies is provided at 25% 2010: 27%.

No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As these earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses of $147.6m 2010: $56.2m to carry forward against future taxable income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
The deferred tax balances are analysed below: Accelerated Short-term tax Share-based timing depreciation Pension charges differences Losses Total $m $m $m $m $m $m Deferred tax assets 59.8 11.5 33.4 71.5 4.0 60.6 Deferred tax liabilities 5.7 5.7 Net deferred tax liability asset 59.8 11.5 33.4 65.8 4.0 54.9 20 Share-based charges The Group currently has four share schemes that give rise to share-based charges.
These are the Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS, the Long-Term Retention Plan LTRP, the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP and the Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan LTCIP.
Further details of these schemes is provided in the Directors Remuneration Report and in note 21.
The charge to operating profit in 2011 for these schemes amounted to $19.2m 2010: $16.7m.
$16.0m of the total charge is credited to retained earnings and $3.2m, relating to the LTCIP, is included in other long-term liabilities as the LTCIP is a cash settled scheme.
The total credit to retained earnings relating to share-based charges in 2011 is $9.7m which comprises the $16.0m mentioned above, $3.6m of accelerated charges relating to the Well Support disposal that have been recorded against the gain on divestment less the fair value of payments made to Well Support employees on the disposal amounting to $9.9m.
The assumptions made in arriving at the charge for each scheme are detailed below: ESOS and LTRP At 31 December 2011 there were 1,158 employees 2010: 1,138 participating in these schemes.
For the purposes of calculating the fair value of the share options, a Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used.
Based on past experience, it has been assumed that options will be exercised, on average, six months after the earliest exercise date, which is four years after grant date, and there will be a lapse rate of between 15% and 20%.
The share price volatility used in the calculation of 35%-40% is based on the actual volatility of the Groups shares since IPO as well as that of comparable companies.
The risk-free rate of return of 1.1%-5.2% is based on the implied yield available on zero coupon gilts with a term remaining equal to the expected lifetime of the options at the date of grant.
A dividend yield of 1.0%-2.0% has been used in the calculations.
The fair value of options granted under the ESOS during the year was 1.62 2010: 1.16.
The fair value of options granted under the LTRP during the year ranged from 4.94 to 6.38 2010: 2.79 to 3.57.
The weighted average remaining contractual life of share options at 31 December 2011 is 5.7 years 2010: 5.5 years.
LTIP The share-based charge for the LTIP was calculated using a fair value of 4.12 for the first cycle, 1.81 for the second cycle, 3.01 for the third cycle and 5.10 for the fourth cycle.
The charge for market related performance targets has been calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking account of share price volatility against peer group companies, risk free rate of return, dividend yield and the expected lifetime of the award.
LTCIP The share-based charge for the LTCIP was calculated using a fair value of 6.18.
The fair value is calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model using similar assumptions to those used for ESOS and LTRP above.

The table above includes amounts relating to the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Production Services Network Limited PSN on 20 April 2011 for a total consideration of $684.9m.
$569.9m was paid in cash, $115.0m of shares were issued and PSNs borrowings of $370.2m were repaid as part of the transaction.
$194.5m of intangible assets were recognised on acquisition.
The total identifiable net liabilities of PSN are stated after recording provisional fair value adjustments of $25.1m.
The fair value adjustments relate mainly to tax issues.
The acquisition of PSN advances Wood Groups strategy of maintaining an appropriate balance between oil & gas development and later cycle production support, creating global market leading positions, developing long-term customer relationships, extending services and broadening international reach.
Wood Group PSN is a global leader in brownfield production services and is well positioned for growth across the oil & gas industry.
The Group also made a number of other acquisitions during the year including the acquisition of 100% of the share capital of Integrated Maintenance Services in the UK, ISI Solutions in Argentina and Gas Turbine Efficiency in the USA.
In addition, the Group also acquired the businesses of PI Consult and Dar E&C in Saudi Arabia.
The acquisitions are not considered to be material to the Group on an individual basis and therefore have been aggregated in the table above.
Provisional fair value adjustments of $9.8m have been booked in relation to the other acquisitions made in the year.
98 John Wood Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year to 31 December 2011 27 Acquisitions and divestments continued The other acquisitions during the year provide the Group with access to new markets and strengthen the Groups capabilities in certain areas.
The acquired companies will be in a position to access the Groups wider client base and use the Groups existing relationships to further grow and develop their businesses.
These factors contribute to the goodwill recognised by the Group on the acquisitions.
The outflow of cash and cash equivalents on the acquisitions made during the year is analysed as follows: $m Cash consideration 656.4 Cash acquired 49.9 Borrowings acquired 372.9 Cash outflow 979.4 Included in the cash outflow above are deferred and contingent consideration payments of $14.6m made during the year in respect of acquisitions made in prior periods and payments of $4.9m to acquire non-controlling interests.
The results of the Group, as if the above acquisitions had been made at the beginning of period, would have been as follows: $m Continuing revenue 6,063.4 Continuing EBITA 365.6 The profit presented above does not include the losses incurred by GTE in the period prior to acquisition, as this would not be representative of the business acquired by the Group.
There have been significant changes to the GTE business during the year and the company has been profitable since acquisition.
Post-acquisition profits are included in the EBITA figure below.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2011, the acquisitions contributed $1,019.4m to revenue and $96.4m to EBITA.
Divestments On 26 April 2011, the Group divested its Well Support division to GE for a consideration of $2,850.0m.
$28.2m of this amount related to the disposal of the Groups interest in a business in the Middle East, the sale of which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2012.
Approximately $2.0m of the agreed proceeds will be paid directly to the minority shareholder in that business.
A further $81.0m of proceeds were received from GE in October 2011 as part of the working capital adjustment.

29 Retirement benefit liabilities One of the Groups pension schemes in the UK, the John Wood Group PLC Retirement Benefits Scheme, is a defined benefit scheme, which is contracted out of the State Scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent investment companies in trustee-administered funds.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 5 April 2010 by a professionally qualified actuary.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries at the balance sheet date were: 2011 2010 % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.90 5.30 Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.90 3.30 Discount rate 4.80 5.40 Expected return on scheme assets 7.00 7.24 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
At 31 December 2011 the actuary has determined pension liabilities by reference to a standard actuarial mortality table which considered UK-wide mortality data relevant to the Groups pension scheme.
Those observed mortality rates have been projected to improve at a specific rate into the future to allow for established trends and expectations in line with normal actuarial practice.
Specifically, the actuarial table used was PXA00 and improvements were in line with the long cohort approach with an annual underpin of 1% p. a.
