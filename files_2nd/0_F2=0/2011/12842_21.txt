PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements General information PZ Cussons Plc is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is domiciled and incorporated in the UK under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is given on page 94.
These financial statements are presented in Sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted for use in the EU, including International Accounting Standards IAS and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC.
Further standards may be issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and standards currently in issue and endorsed by the EU may be subject to interpretations issued by the IFRIC.
The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles under IFRS, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for the revaluation of certain financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through the income statement.
The financial statements have been prepared using consistent accounting policies except as stated below.
Standards and interpretations The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been adopted for the financial year ending 31 May 2011: IFRS 3 revised, Business combinations, and consequential amendments to IAS 27, Consolidated and separate financial statements, IAS 28, Investments in associates, and IAS 31, Interests in joint ventures, are effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
The revised standard continues to apply the acquisition method to business combinations but with some significant changes compared with IFRS 3.
For example, all payments to purchase a business are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, with contingent payments classified as debt subsequently remeasured through the statement of comprehensive income.
There is a choice on an  basis to measure the non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees net assets.
All acquisition-related costs are expensed.
The revised standard was applied to the acquisition of the controlling interest in St Tropez Holdings Limited as set out in note 29.
As the Group has adopted IFRS 3 revised, it is required to adopt IAS 27 revised, Consolidated and separate financial statements, at the same time.
IAS 27 revised requires the effects of all transactions with non-controlling interests to be recorded in equity if there is no change in control and these transactions will no longer result in goodwill or gains and losses.
The standard also specifies the accounting when control is lost.
Any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured to fair value, and a gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
There has been no impact of IAS 27 revised on the current period, as none of the non-controlling interests have a deficit balance.
There have been no transactions whereby an interest in an entity is retained after the loss of control of that entity.
During the year the Group has acquired additional share capital in PZ Cussons Nigeria Plc that has resulted in a debit of 1.6 million being recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
Prior to the introduction of IAS 27 revised this would have been recognised as an addition to goodwill.
The amendment does not require the restatement of previous transactions.
IFRS 1 revised, First time adoption.
Amendments to IFRS 1 for additional exemptions.
This is not applicable to the Group.
IFRS 2 amendments, Group cash-settled share based payment transactions, effective from 1 January 2010.
The Group has applied IFRS 2 amendments from 1 June 2010.
There are no material impacts for the Group.
IAS 39 amendments, Eligible hedged items, IFRIC 16 Hedges of net investment in a foreign operation and IFRIC 17 Distributions of non-cash assets to owner are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
IFRIC 17, Distribution of non-cash assets to owners effective on or after 1 July 2009.
The interpretation was published in November 2008.
This interpretation provides guidance on accounting for arrangements whereby an entity distributes non-cash assets to shareholders either as a distribution of reserves or as dividends.
IFRS 5 has also been amended to require that assets are classified as held for distribution only when they are available for distribution in their present condition and the distribution is highly probable.
55 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued IFRIC 18, Transfers of assets from customers, effective for transfer of assets received on or after 1 July 2009.
This interpretation clarifies the requirements of IFRSs for agreements in which an entity receives from a customer an item of property, plant and equipment that the entity must then use either to connect the customer to a network or to provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services such as a supply of electricity, gas or water.
In some cases, the entity receives cash from a customer that must be used only to acquire or construct the item of property, plant and equipment in order to connect the customer to a network or provide the customer with ongoing access to a supply of goods or services or to do both.
IAS 32 amendment Classification of rights issues.
The amendment addresses the accounting for rights issues that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the issuer.
Provided certain conditions are met, such rights issues are now classified as equity regardless of the currency in which the exercise price is denominated.
Previously, these issues had to be accounted for as derivative liabilities.
The amendment applies retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors.
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial year ending 31 May 2011 and have not been early adopted: IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments effective 1 July 2010.
IAS 24 Revised Related party disclosures effective 1 January 2011.
IFRIC 14 amendment The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective 1 January 2011.
IFRS 9 Financial instruments effective 1 January 2013.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements effective 1 January 2013.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements effective 1 January 2013.
IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities effective 1 January 2013.
IAS 19 revised 2011 Employee benefits effective 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement effective 1 January 2013.
The Group is yet to assess the full impact of the above standards: however they are unlikely to have a significant impact.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of PZ Cussons Plc and entities controlled by PZ Cussons Plc its subsidiaries made up to 31 May each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the ability to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the fair value of consideration over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The total profits or losses of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated income statement and the interest of non-controlling interests is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
Subsequently, losses applicable to the non-controlling interest in excess of the non-controlling interests interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the interests of the Group except to the extent that the non-controlling interest has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
The interest of non-controlling interests in the acquiree is initially measured at the non-controlling interests proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Where non-controlling interests are acquired, the excess of costs over the value of the non-controlling interest acquired is recorded in equity.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, the accounts of the overseas subsidiaries are adjusted to conform to the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Operating profit Operating profit is the profit of the Group before finance income, finance costs and taxation.
56 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 1.
Accounting policies continued Exceptional items The Group adopts a columnar income statement format to highlight significant items within the Group results for the year.
Such items are considered by the Directors to be exceptional in nature rather than being representative of the underlying trading of the Group, and may include such items as restructuring costs, acquisition related costs, material impairments of non-current assets, material profits and losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment, profit or loss on disposal or termination of operations and material pension settlements and amendments.
The Directors apply judgement in assessing the particular items, which by virtue of their scale and nature should be disclosed in a separate column of the income statement and notes to the financial statements as Exceptional items.
The Directors believe that the separate disclosure of these items is relevant to an understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The fair value of consideration of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations, which are recognised and measured at the lower of the assets previous carrying value and fair value less costs to sell.
Interests in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, that is when the strategic, financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
Joint venture arrangements that involve the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest are referred to as jointly controlled entities.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under IAS 28 Investments in associates and IAS 31 Interests in joint ventures, a single figure for post-tax results is presented as a separate item on the face of the income statement as part of profit before tax within operating profit.
Long-term loans which are considered to be permanent as equity are combined with the Groups share of net assets liabilities and shown on a single line within non-current assets.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the subsidiary or jointly controlled entity recognised at the date of acquisition.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill also includes amounts to reflect deferred tax liabilities established in relation to acquisitions in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or a jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous Generally Accepted Accounting Practice in the UK UK GAAP amounts.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets An acquired brand is only recognised on the balance sheet where it is supported by a registered trademark, where brand earnings are separately identifiable and the brand could be sold separately from the rest of the business.
Brands acquired as part of a business combination are recorded in the balance sheet at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Trademarks, patents and purchased brands are recorded at purchase cost.
Brands currently held are not amortised as the Directors believe they have indefinite lives.
In accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of assets, the brands are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
57 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately as income.
Profit or losses on disposal of brands are included within operating profit.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates and sales related taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Sales of goods are recognised when title has passed and the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are expressed in Sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency are recorded at the actual rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising on the translation and consolidation of foreign operations income statements and balance sheets denominated in foreign currencies are recorded as a separate component of equity.
Applying the exemption under IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has set the currency reserve to zero at 1 June 2004, the date of transition to IFRS and measured and recorded separately in that currency reserve all cumulative foreign currency translation differences arising after that date.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative translation differences will be transferred to the income statement in the period of the disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Finance income and expense Finance income and expense are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Government grants Government grants related to property, plant and equipment are reflected in the balance sheet as deferred income and credited to the income statement over the useful lives of the assets concerned.
Government grants relating to income are reflected in the balance sheet as deferred income and credited to the income statement over the period to which the grant relates.
Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates retirement benefit schemes in the UK and for most overseas countries in which it carries on business.
Those in the UK are defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes: overseas schemes vary in detail depending on local practice.
The UK defined benefit schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 May 2008.
58 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 1.
Accounting policies continued In respect of the defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with full actuarial valuations being carried out every three years or more frequently should a material change occur in any of the schemes.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits have already vested, and otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
All components of the pension cost are included within operating profit.
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Share based payments The Group operates a Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme, a Performance Share Plan and an Executive Share Option Scheme for senior executives, all of which involve equity-settled share based payments.
Equity-settled share based payments under the Executive Share Option Scheme are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non-market based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
Fair value is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The awards under the Performance Share Plan are measured at the fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the period to which the performance relates and are based on the expected outcome of the vesting conditions.
The awards under the Deferred Annual Share Bonus Scheme are measured at fair value at the date of grant and are expensed over the period to which the performance relates.
Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current and deferred tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax liabilities on a net basis.
59 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Land and buildings held for use in the production or supply of goods or services, or for administration purposes, are stated in the balance sheet at deemed cost at the date of transition to IFRS less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All other assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis: Freehold buildings at rates not less than 2% Leasehold buildings at rates which will reduce the book value to nil on or before the termination of the leases with a minimum of 2% Plant and machinery not less than 8% Fixtures, fittings and vehicles not less than 20% In the case of major projects depreciation is provided from the date the project in question is brought into use.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement for the period.
The assets residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred, unless it meets the criteria for capitalisation set out in IAS 38 Intangible assets.
Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts Cash, cash equivalents and bank overdrafts includes cash at bank and in hand plus short-term deposits less overdrafts.
Short-term deposits have a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecast transactions.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments primarily interest rate swaps to hedge a proportion of the exposure to floating interest rate fluctuations.
The occasional use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles in the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Groups risk management strategy.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value at the contract date, and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
60 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 1.
Accounting policies continued Borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis through the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Investments Investments other than interests in joint ventures are recognised and derecognised on a trade date when a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments are classified as either held-to-maturity, held-for-trading, loans and receivables or available-for-sale.
Held-to-maturity investments and loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost.
Held-for-trading and available-for-sale investments are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value.
Where securities are held-for-trading purposes, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are included in the income statement for the period.
For available-for-sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Provisions for restructuring costs are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Dividend distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
In respect of interim dividends these are recognised once paid.
Critical accounting policies and key sources of estimation uncertainty Estimates and accounting judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires management to make assumptions and estimates about future events.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, differ from the actual results.
The assumptions and estimates that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: Accounting for intangible assets The Group records all intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination at fair value.
Intangible assets are deemed to have indefinite lives and as such are not amortised but are subject, as a minimum, to annual tests for impairment.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the intangible asset has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires management to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Details of key estimates are discussed in note 10.
Retirement benefits The Group has three main defined benefit schemes which are based and administered in the UK and are independent of the Groups finances.
These schemes were closed to future accrual on 31 May 2008.
Actuarial valuations are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years.
The retirement benefit cost under IAS 19 is assessed in accordance with the advice of a firm of actuaries based on the latest actuarial valuation and assumptions advised by the actuary.
The assumptions are based on information supplied to the actuary by the Company, supplemented by discussions between the actuary and management.
The assumptions are disclosed in note 23.
Operating results are affected by the actuarial assumptions used.
These assumptions include discount rates, mortality rates, inflation rates, expected long-term rates of return on assets, take-up rates on enhanced transfer value exercises and may differ from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions and longer or shorter lives of participants.
61 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Revenue recognition The Group recognises revenue generally at the time of delivery, which represents the point at which the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customer, and when collection of the resulting consideration for those goods is reasonably assured.
Should management consider that the criteria for recognition are not met, revenue is deferred until such time as the consideration has been fully earned.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable net of discounts, rebates and sales-related taxes but including interest receivable on sales on extended credit and income from the provision of technical services and agreements.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Segmental analysis The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Executive Board.
The Executive Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the operating segments based on these reports.
The Executive Board considers the business from a geographic perspective, with Africa, Asia and Europe being the reporting segments.
The Executive Board assesses the performance based on operating profit before any exceptional items.
Interest income and cost are not included in the results for each operating segment that is reviewed by the Executive Board.
Other information provided to the Executive Board, except as noted below, is measured in a manner consistent with that of the financial statements.
Sales between segments are carried out at arms length.

Exceptional items Year to 31 May 2011 Exceptional Exceptional item before item after taxation Taxation taxation Note m m m Exceptional items included within operating profit: Pension fide-risking charges 23 2.4 0.7 1.7 Pension benefit of change from RPI to CPI 23 7.5 2.0 5.5 Acquisition expenses St Tropez 29 1.7 0.2 1.5 Beauty Division formation costs 4.2 1.0 3.2 Deferred tax benefit of change in UK corporation tax rate relating to brands 2.1 2.1 0.8 2.0 1.2 Explanation of exceptional items Pension scheme The Group has commenced a fide-risking exercise in relation to the UK defined benefit pension schemes in order to reduce the impact of future volatility of changes in the valuation of the schemes assets and liabilities.
The first element of this fide-risking exercise is an enhanced transfer value exercise for deferred members of the main UK pension scheme.
This exercise commenced in May 2011 and the charge in the year of 2.4 million represents an assessment of the likely cost based on expected take-up rates.
A further charge in relation to this exercise is likely in the next financial year.
The Government announced in December 2010 that the inflation measure for determining minimum pension increases will move from RPI to CPI.
In general the CPI index is lower than RPI and this has led to a reduction in the scheme liabilities as at 31 May 2011.
The effect of this change on the liabilities has been reported through the income statement as a past service credit of 7.5 million due to it being a change in benefit.
Acquisition of St Tropez The Group incurred 1.7 million of acquisition and related costs for the purchase of St Tropez Holdings Limited.
Details of the acquisition are given in note 29.
Formation of the Beauty Division In February 2011, the Group announced the formation of the Beauty Division, bringing the Groups more premium brands The Sanctuary, Charles Worthington and St Tropez together as one strategic business unit.
The formation of the Beauty Division has led to the consolidation of the operations into a new Central London office and will result in the closure of St Tropezs Nottingham site, Sanctuarys Hemel site and the Sanctuary offices in London.
The Charles Worthington business, previously integrated into the PZ Cussons UK operating unit, is also being transferred.
The exceptional costs principally relate to restructuring costs and certain other costs of integrating the three brands into a new single operating unit.
Deferred tax benefit of change in UK corporation tax rate relating to brands The UK corporation tax rate reduced to 26% from 28% on 1 April 2011.
As a result of this change, the deferred tax balances relating to UK assets and liabilities have been reduced to take account of the substantively enacted rate change.
The largest single effect of the rate change is in relation to the deferred tax liability recognised when The Sanctuary and Charles Worthington brands were acquired and this has been disclosed as an exceptional item due to its size and the fact that it relates to a previous acquisition.
Year to 31 May 2010 There were no exceptional items in 2010.

Taxation continued Taxation on items taken directly to equity was a credit of 1.6 million 2010: 4.4 million and relates to the movement in deferred tax on actuarial losses, on share option schemes and on financial derivatives recognised in the hedging reserve.
The tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the consolidated income statement as follows: 2011 2010 m m Profit before tax 108.1 101.8 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 27.69% 2010: 28.00% 29.9 28.5 Tax effect of revenue expenses that are not taxable deductible 0.4 0.1 Effect of different tax rates of subsidiaries in overseas jurisdictions 0.6 0.2 Effect of UK rate change on deferred taxation 2.0 Tax effect of share of results of joint ventures 0.1 0.4 Overseas withholding tax suffered on dividends 0.9 0.6 Prior period adjustment 0.3 0.1 Tax charge for the year 28.2 29.1 The main rate of corporation tax in the UK reduced from 28% to 26% from 1 April 2011.
The change in deferred tax has resulted in a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of 2.2 million of which 2.0 million has been recognised in the income statement and 0.2 million direct to equity.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax in the UK by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 26% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 May 2011, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by 2.6 million being 0.9 million recognised in 2012, 0.9 million recognised in 2013 and 0.8 million recognised in 2014.
The expected changes have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.

On 27 September 2010, the Group, through its subsidiary PZ Cussons Holdings Ltd, acquired the entire share capital of St Tropez Holdings Ltd, a company registered in the UK whose principal activity is the provision of sunless tanning products.
This resulted in the recognition of a brand value of 58.4 million and generated goodwill of 11.1 million.
Goodwill and other intangible assets, which all have indefinite useful lives, are subject to annual impairment testing, or more frequent testing if there are indications of impairment.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations that use amounts from approved budgets and plans over a period of five years 2010: five years and cash flows projected forward assuming a perpetual growth rate of 3.0% 2010: 3.0%.
The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections ranged from 8.0% to 10.0% on a pre-tax basis 2010: 7.3% to 8.4%.
The average per-annum growth rate applied to the initial period ranges from 5.0% to 10.0% 2010: 5.5% to 10.0% and was based on industry growth rates.
Intangible assets and goodwill are allocated to the appropriate CGU identified, which is directly driven by the brand of product.

The Group does not exercise significant influence over the affairs of this company as it does not have the ability to participate in the financial and operating policies of the entity, and it is therefore not treated as an associated company.

Trade receivables consist of a broad cross section of our international customer base for whom there is no significant history of default.
The credit risk of customers is assessed at a subsidiary and Group level, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors.
Individual customer credit limits are imposed based on these factors.
The credit period taken on sales ranges from 19 to 95 days 2010: 24 to 97 days due to the differing nature of trade receivables in the Groups geographical segments.

The weighted average rate of interest on bank overdrafts was 2.3% 2010: 12.7%.
Bank overdrafts are at floating rates of interest and hence expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.

Debt raised in currencies other than Sterling is, in most cases, raised in the functional currency of the entity raising the debt.
At 31 May 2011, the Group had un-drawn facilities of 123.6 million 2010: 101.3 million available to it.
Financial instruments and risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, credit risk, liquidity and interest rates.
The primary risk faced by the Group is exchange rate risk.
The Board has reviewed and agreed policies for management of this risk and has also approved all of the classes of financial instruments that may be used by the Group.
The Groups treasury function reports to the Board at least annually with reference to the application of the Group treasury policy.
The policy addresses issues of liquidity, funding and investment as well as interest rate, currency and commodity risks.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse these risks, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and limits continually by means of reliable and up-to-date systems.
The Group modifies and enhances its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in markets and products.
The Group Risk Committee, under authority delegated by the Board, formulates the high level Group risk management policy, monitors risk and receives reports that allow it to review the effectiveness of the Groups risk management policies.
Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer or counterparty to meet its obligations under a contract.
It arises principally from lending, trade finance, treasury and leasing activities.
The Group has dedicated standards, policies and procedures to control and monitor all such risks.
Although the Group is potentially exposed to credit loss in the event of non-performance by counterparties, such credit risk is controlled through credit rating and equity price reviews of the counterparties and by limiting the total amount of exposure to any one party.
The Group does not believe it is exposed to any material concentrations of credit risk.
Liquidity management Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group maintains a strong liquidity position and manages the liquidity profile of its assets, liabilities and commitments so that cash flows are appropriately balanced and all funding obligations are met when due.
The Group has committed credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions.
The Group has negotiated facilities with its bankers that provide sufficient headroom to ensure liquidity and continuity of funding.
73 PZ Cussons Plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.
Borrowings continued Market risk management Market risk is the risk that movements in market rates, including foreign exchange rates, interest rates, equity and commodity prices will reduce the Groups income.
The management of market risk is undertaken using risk limits approved by the operating unit Finance Directors under delegated authority.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
Subsidiary undertakings must ensure that all transactional exposures arising from commitments in a currency other than their functional currency are identified and monitored.
The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to manage these exposures.
Price risk The Group is not exposed to equity securities price risk.
Due to the nature of the business, the Group is exposed to commodity price risk.
The Group does take measures to protect against short-term impacts of these fluctuations, however, failure to recover higher costs could have a negative impact on profits.
Cash flow and interest rate risk The Groups variable rate borrowings are exposed to a risk of change in cash flows due to changes in interest rates.
The Group has reduced its exposure to this by entering into interest rate swaps.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group had a positive net funds position as at 31 May 2011 and 31 May 2010.

Borrowings continued Fair values Financial instruments utilised by the Group during the years ended 31 May 2011 and 31 May 2010, together with information regarding the methods and assumptions used to calculate fair values, can be summarised as follows: Current and non-current investments In accordance with IAS 39 Financial instruments: Recognition and Measurement, unlisted investments are held in the Groups balance sheet at cost because their fair value cannot be measured reliably due to the lack of quoted market prices.
Current assets and liabilities Financial instruments included within current assets and liabilities excluding cash and borrowings are generally short-term in nature and accordingly their fair values approximate to their book values.
Borrowings and cash The carrying values of cash and short-term borrowings approximate to their fair values because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The financial instruments held by the Group do not, either individually or as a class, create a potentially significant exposure to market, credit, liquidity or cash flow interest rate risk.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of the carrying values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 May 2011 and 31 May 2010.

On 31 May 2008 the three defined benefit schemes in the UK were closed to future accrual.

Retirement benefits continued The Group also operates an unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit scheme.
The cost of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit scheme is included in the total pension cost, on a basis consistent with IAS 19 Employee benefits and the assumptions set out below.
In accordance with these unfunded arrangements, the Group made payments during the year to former directors of 141,338 2010: 33,055.
The last triennial actuarial valuations of the schemes administered in the UK were performed by independent professional actuaries at 1 June 2009 using the projected unit method of valuation.
In May 2011, the Group commenced a fide-risking exercise of the UK defined benefit pension schemes through the offer of an enhanced transfer value to deferred members.
The cost of this exercise in the year was 2.0 million based on expected take-up rate.
Due to the statutory change for the calculation of inflationary increases to pensions from RPI to CPI, a past service credit has been recognised of 7.5 million 2010: nil.
For the year to 31 May 2011 the total defined benefit pension credit arising from the three schemes amounted to 6.3 million 2010: charge of 1.1 million.
The major financial assumptions used by the actuary were as follows: 2011 2010 Rate of increase in salaries 4.35% 4.30% Rate of increase in retirement benefits in payment 3.35% 3.30% Discount rate 5.25% 5.60% Inflation assumption 3.35% 3.30% The mortality assumptions used were as follows: 2011 2010 Years Years Weighted average life expectancy on post-retirement mortality table used to determine benefit obligations Member age 65 current life expectancy 22.1 22.0 Member age 40 life expectancy at age 65 24.6 24.6 The assets in the schemes and the expected rates of return were: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Equities 7.60% 121.0 7.75% 114.5 8.00% 96.2 Bonds 4.10% 96.9 5.90% 41.3 6.75% 86.0 Property 5.65% 38.8 5.90% 72.5 NA Cash and other 0.50% 5.2 0.50% 8.1 0.50% 9.6 Total fair value of scheme assets 261.9 236.4 191.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 259.1 243.8 196.1 Surplus deficit in the schemes 2.8 7.4 4.3 Related deferred tax liability asset 0.7 2.0 1.2 Net retirement benefit surplus deficit 2.1 5.4 3.1 To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset class in which the portfolio is invested, and the expectations for future returns of each class of asset.
The expected return for each class of asset was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual gain on plan assets was 28.8 million 2010: 49.1 million.
The net retirement benefit income expense before taxation recognised in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit schemes is summarised as follows: 2011 2010 m m Expected return on scheme assets 14.2 12.3 Interest cost 13.4 13.4 Net retirement benefit income expense before taxation 0.8 1.1 All above amounts are recognised in the Groups income statement before arriving at operating profit.

Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group for any reason outside of the scheme rules.
Options under the scheme are exercisable in a period beginning no earlier than three years from the date of grant and are subject to performance conditions.
Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the date of grant is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model according to the relevant measures of performance.
The model includes adjustments, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of exercise restrictions, behavioural considerations and expected dividend payments.
The option life is derived by the models based on these assumptions and other assumptions identified below.

Performance Share Plan The Group operates a Performance Share Plan PSP for main Board Executive Directors excluding the previous Chairman and certain key senior executives.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Groups performance over the three year period following the award date.

The fair value of the award is taken as the share price at the date of grant.
The number of awards outstanding but not yet exercisable is 3,447,093 at 31 May 2011 2010: 3,001,116.
