There have been no transfers into or out of Level 3 in either year.
The Group measures its entitlement to the royalty streams and any optionality embedded within the royalty instruments using discounted cash flow models.
In determining the discount rate to be applied, management consider the country and sovereign risk associated with the projects, together with the time horizon to the commencement of production and the success or failure of projects of a similar nature.
Management have not undertaken detailed analysis of the impact of using alternative discount rates on the fair value of the royalty streams or the optionality embedded in the royalty instruments, as the rates used reflect the risks inherent in the four projects and the use of alternative rates would be unjustified.
4 Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are regularly evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
4.1 Critical accounting estimates and assumptions The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates and assumptions will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are addressed below: a Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals note 2.6, note 2.7, note 2.8, note 16, note 17, note 18 and note 19. b Recoverability of deferred tax assets note 2.10 and note 23.
