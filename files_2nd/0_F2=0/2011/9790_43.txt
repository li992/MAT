82 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Segmental information IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reporting about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The chief operating decision maker has been identified as the executive directors.
The executive directors review the Groups internal reporting in order to assess performance and allocate resources.
The operating segments are UK and International which are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting to the executive directors.
The UK segment consists of the UK retail business and UK franchise operations.
The International segment consists of Marks & Spencer owned businesses in the Republic of Ireland, Europe and Asia, together with international franchise operations.
The executive directors assess the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of non-underlying items from the operating segments.
Central costs are all classified as UK costs and presented within UK operating profit.
The executive directors also monitor revenue within the segments.
To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue within the reportable segments.
2 Adjustments to revenue relate to revenue deductions recognised in cost of sales for management accounting purposes.
In addition, underlying profit excludes profits and losses on the disposal of properties, impairment charges, pension credits arising on changes of the defined benefit pension schemes, non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments and costs relating to strategic changes that are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business see note 5.
