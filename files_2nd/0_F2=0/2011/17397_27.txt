Accounting policies WS Atkins plc the Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The address of its registered office is Woodcote Grove, Ashley Road, Epsom, Surrey, KT18 5BW, England.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these Consolidated Financial Statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, including the application of new IFRSs and interpretations unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements of WS Atkins plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRSs as adopted by the EU, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of pensions, share-based payments and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Material estimates applied across the Groups businesses and joint ventures are reviewed to a common standard and adjusted where appropriate to ensure that consistent treatment of similar and related issues that require judgement is achieved upon consolidation.
Any revisions to estimates are recognised prospectively.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Groups accounting policies.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the Consolidated Financial Statements, are disclosed under Critical Accounting Policies are incorporated by reference on page 40 of the Business Review.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Income Statement and Balance Sheet include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of joint ventures.
The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement from the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Income Statement up to the date of disposal.
Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly controlled by the Group.
Control exists where the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairments.
Cost includes direct attributable costs of investment.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the assets, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date irrespective of any non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Goodwill is reviewed on finalisation of fair values and any adjustments required to the accounting are recorded within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where subsidiaries adopt accounting policies that are different from the Group, their reported results are restated to comply with the Groups accounting policies.
All intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where subsidiaries do not adopt accounting periods that are coterminous with the Groups, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date based on unaudited accounts.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator of the asset transferred.
