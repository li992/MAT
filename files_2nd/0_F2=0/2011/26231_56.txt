OUR GROUP OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 105 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED v International 2011 2010 m m USA LGA 104 85 Netherlands LGN 21 20 France LGF 20 6 Total Europe operating profit 41 26 1 Other 8 9 2 Total International operating profit 137 102 1.
Other includes our joint venture operations in Egypt, the Gulf, India and divisional overhead costs of 5m 2010: 5m.
In the year, the International division paid 51m 2010: 44m of sustainable dividends to the Group, which has been included in net cash generation.
In addition, the LGN business paid a special dividend of 29m and the LGA business remitted a further 52m of capital representing the repatriation of profits in 2010 from the redemption of external debt during the first quarter of 2011.
These amounts have been excluded from the Groups net cash generation.

The increase in the average Group capital and nancing assets has resulted in an increase in the smoothed investment return to 191m 2010: 187m.
The smoothed investment return is calculated asset class by asset class and equates to an average smoothed investment return of 4.7% 2010: 5.8% on the average balance of invested assets of 4.0bn 2010: 3.2bn.
In GCF, the rate used to calculate the smoothed return on cash and LIBOR benchmarked bonds has been reduced.
The cash rate previously used of 4% has been replaced with a 1 year LIBOR of 1%.
This ensures our operating profit and cash metric maintains relevance in current macroeconomic conditions.
This change has reduced operating profit by 52m, with an opposite impact on investment variance, and operational cash generations by 38m.
It is our intention to continue with this prudent view in 2012.
Interest expense excludes interest on non recourse nancing see Note 35. vii Variation from longer term investment return 2011 2010 m m 1 Risk 172 102 2 Savings 13 4 Investment management 7 8 3 International 21 35 4 GCF asset related 159 52 Asset related investment variances 2 185 5 Savings other investment variance 47 58 6 Treasury related 68 72 7 Dened benefit pension scheme 20 35 Other investment variances 95 95 Total variation from longer term investment return 97 90 1.
The positive investment variance has increased to 172m 2010: 102m.
The contributing factors are: improved asset diversity which increased the risk adjusted yield, for example, sale and leaseback: no defaults in the portfolio: improved asset liability matching, for example, reinvestment into longer duration bonds: more efficient cash management and small one-off benets from tax and interest rate movements.
The positive Savings asset related investment variance was driven by movements in the gilt portfolio backing non-linked reserves.
The International investment variance has arisen in LGN.
The variance is caused by temporary timing differences in the valuation of the assets against the liabilities on the index linked margin business.
The variance should be broadly neutral over the longer term.
The GCF asset related investment variance was primarily driven by a fall in equity markets which contributed 139 m to the adverse investment variance.
This change has reduced operating profit by 52m, with an opposite impact on investment variance, and operational cash generation by 38m.
Savings business other investment variance is primarily the difference between IFRS deferred policyholder tax and the amount included within the unit linked life funds.
Treasury related investment variance relates to derivative contracts which have not been designated within hedge accounting relationships resulting in short term income statement volatility which, in 2011, resulted in a decrease in the relevant long term interest rates.
The dened benefit pension scheme investment variance includes the actuarial gains and losses and valuation difference arising on annuity assets held by the dened benefit pension schemes that have been purchased from Legal & General Assurance Society Limited.
