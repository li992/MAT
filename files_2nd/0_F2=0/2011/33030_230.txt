The main share-based payment plans that existed during the year are detailed below.
Plans for executive directors For further information on the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP see the Directors remuneration report on pages 139 to 151.
Plans for senior employees The group operates a number of equity-settled share plans under which share units are granted to its senior leaders and certain other employees.
These plans typically have a three-year performance or restricted period during which the units accrue net notional dividends which are treated as having been reinvested.
Leaving employment will normally preclude the conversion of units into shares, but special arrangements apply for participants that leave for qualifying reasons.
Grants are settled in cash where the regulatory environment prohibits participants to hold BP shares.
Performance unit plans The number of units granted is related to the level of seniority of employees.
The number of units converted to shares is determined by reference to performance measures over the three-year performance period.
The main performance measure used is BPs total shareholder return TSR compared to the other oil majors.
Plans included in this category are the Competitive Performance Plan CPP and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
Restricted share unit plans Share unit grants under BPs restricted plans typically take into account the employees performance in either the current or the prior year, track record of delivery, business and leadership skills and potential.
One restricted share unit plan for senior employees, used in special circumstances such as recruitment and retention, normally has no performance conditions.
Plans included in this category are the Executive Performance Plan EPP, the Restricted Share Plan RSP, the Deferred Annual Bonus Plan DAB and, in part, the Performance Share Plan PSP.
BP Share Option Plan BPSOP Share options with an exercise price equivalent to the market price of a BP share immediately preceding the date of grant were granted to participants annually until 2006.
These options are not subject to any performance conditions and are exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.
BP Plan 2011 Share options with an exercise price equivalent to the market price of a BP share immediately preceding the date of grant were granted to participants in 2011.
These options are not subject to any performance conditions and will be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of the grant date.
Share Value Plan In 2012, the group will launch a new performance plan known as the Share Value Plan SVP which will grant restricted share units with a three-year performance period.
The number of units granted is dependent on grade and country of operation.
The performance measures are grade specic and include individual rating, balanced scorecard and TSR criteria.
For the 2012 performance year, no further grants will be made under DAB: and from 1 January 2012, no further grants will be made under CPP, EPP or PSP.
Other plans For further information on BPs savings and matching plans, including the BP ShareMatch plans and the BP ShareSave Plan, see page 158.

The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair values of the TSR elements of the 2011, 2010 and 2009 CPP and EDIP grants and the 2009 PSP grant.
In accordance with the plans rules, the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against its principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historical dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
Employee Share Ownership Plan Trusts ESOPs ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the BP share plans as required.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards and are funded by the group.
Until such time as the companys own shares held by the ESOPs vest unconditionally to employees, the amount paid for those shares is shown as a reduction in shareholders equity see Note 39.
Assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the group.
At 31 December 2011, the ESOPs held 27,784,503 shares 2010 11,477,253 shares and 2009 18,062,246 shares for potential future awards, which had a market value of $197 million 2010 $82 million and 2009 $174 million.
