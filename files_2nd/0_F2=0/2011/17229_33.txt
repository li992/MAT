41 Pensions a Defined benefit pension scheme The Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits defined on retirement based on age at date of retirement, years of service and a formula using either the employees compensation package or career average revalued earnings CARE.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at 6 April 2010 and were updated for FRS 17 Retirement benefits purposes for the period to 30 January 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
During the prior year, the pension scheme moved from a final salary basis to career average revalued earnings representing an accounting curtailment of certain pension liabilities.
In accordance with FRS 17, the defined pension schemes obligations were revalued by the schemes actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
As a result a pensions credit of 39m was recognised in the profit and loss account during the prior year.
On 8 July 2010 the Government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI will be used as the basis for inflationary increases to pensions in its next update of the statutory requirement.
Following this, the Accounting Standards Board has issued UITF 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the retail prices index with the consumer prices index for retirement benefits clarifying the required accounting treatment and indicating the use of CPI rather than RPI where the scheme rules allow.
The Company has consulted with its advisors and based on review of certain clauses in the schemes trust deeds has concluded that this change is applicable to certain deferred members within the Companys defined benefit scheme.
The trust deeds state that, for those members affected, a statutory index should be used and therefore the actuarial assumptions applied within this financial report have been updated accordingly.
This has resulted in a credit of 8m recognised in the STRGL within actuarial gains losses during the year.
The current best estimate of employer contributions to be paid for the year commencing 31 January 2011 is 22m 2010: 22m.
b Assumptions The major assumptions used in this valuation to determine the present value of the schemes defined benefit obligation are shown below.
The assumptions used at the valuation date of 2 July 2009, used in calculating the pensions credit recognised in the year to 31 January 2010 of 39m, remained the same as the previous year end 1 February 2009 apart from the discount rate, which reduced from 6.25% to 6.0%.

co. uk annualreport11 Annual report and financial statements 2011 96 Notes to the Company financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 30 January 2011 41 Pensions continued b Assumptions continued ii Longevity The average life expectancy in years of a member who reaches normal retirement age of 65 and is currently aged 45 is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Male 24.2 23.5 23.5 Female 25.1 25.8 25.8 The average life expectancy in years of a member retiring at the age of 65 at balance sheet date is as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Male 21.8 22.2 22.2 Female 22.8 24.7 24.7 Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set based on actuarial advice and in accordance with published statistics.
The longevity assumption considers how long a member will live when they reach the age of retirement.
Amongst the UK population there is a continuing trend for a generation to live longer than the preceding generation, and this has been reflected in the longevity assumption.
This means that a 45 year old today is assumed to live on average longer than a 65 year old today.
This particular adjustment, described in the mortality tables below, is known as Long Cohort and is in line with the latest advice from the Pension Regulator.
In calculating the present value of the liabilities the actuary selects the appropriate mortality table that reflects the longevity assumption.
The most up-to-date tables are used in each period.
The current mortality table used is S1PMA S1PFA-Heavy YOB 2010 and 2009: PNX00 YOB LC.
iii Expected return on assets The major assumptions used to determine the expected future return on the schemes assets, were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Long term rate of return on: Equities 7.45% 7.25% 7.00% Bonds 5.60% 5.65% 6.00% Gilts 4.44% 4.35% 4.254.50% Property 5.65% 6.00% Cash 1.50% 1.50% 2.50% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
c Valuations The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are inherently uncertain, were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Equities 234 158 127 Bonds 172 162 125 Gilts 146 142 119 Property 26 25 Cash 1 2 1 Total market value of assets 553 490 397 Present value of scheme liabilities 537 468 400 Surplus deficit in the scheme pension asset liability 16 22 3 Related deferred tax liability asset 4 6 1 Net pension asset liability in the balance sheet 12 16 2 Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Annual report and financial statements 2011 97 Strategic review 4 21 Performance review 22 31 Governance 32 51 Group financial statements 52 88 Company financial statements 89 101 Investor information 102 105 41 Pensions continued c Valuations continued The movement in the fair value of the schemes assets over the year was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 m m m Fair value of scheme assets at start of period 490 397 407 Expected return on scheme assets 31 26 29 Actuarial gain loss 13 48 85 Employer contributions 22 22 47 Employee contributions 5 5 5 Benefits paid 8 8 6 Fair value of scheme assets at end of period 553 490 397 The above pension scheme assets do not include any investments in the Companys own shares or property occupied by any member of the Group.

The shares repurchased represented 2.15% of the ordinary share capital of the Company at 3 February 2008. b Merger reserve The merger reserve represents the reserve arising on the acquisition in 2004 of Safeway Limited.
In the opinion of the Directors, this reserve is not distributable and accordingly it will be carried forward as a capital reserve.

At 30 January 2011, there was a credit balance of 35.6m including uncleared banking items 2010: nil.
The Company has also provided a guarantee in respect of Sterling and Euro Bonds, amounting to 621m 2010: 818m in respect of a subsidiary undertaking.
Where the Company enters into financial contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
In April 2010, the Office of Fair Trading OFT confirmed that it has dropped all allegations against Morrisons in relation to is ongoing Dairy Products investigation.
Morrisons had always believed strongly that it had no case to answer, and therefore the OFTs decision to drop all allegations against Morrisons was a welcome vindication of Morrisons position.
Additionally, the OFT issued a decision, alleging that the Company was engaged in unlawful practices in relation to retail prices for tobacco products in the UK.
The Board considers the OFTs stance to be illogical and without foundation and expects that when the case is considered with proper judicial scrutiny by the Competition Appeals Tribunal, it will be overturned.
The Board has not made a provision for such a liability.
49 Related party transactions The Company has taken the exemption available in FRS 8 Related parties from disclosing related party transactions with wholly owned entities that are part of the Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC Group.
The Company has provided services to Farmers Boy Deeside Limited, a non-wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, as it has paid for goods on behalf of Farmers Boy Deeside Limited totalling cash payments of 7m and has provided additional cash advances of 5m.
In addition, Farmers Boy Deeside Limited has sold goods to the Company totalling 20m.
At the year end the amount due to the Company from Farmers Boy Deeside Limited is 8m.
50 Post balance sheet events a Borrowings On 4 March 2011, the Company concluded a renewal of its revolving finance facility.
The new facility will be provided by a syndicate of 8 banks, and will give the Company access to funding of 1,200m for a period of 5 years from the date of signing.
b Final dividend The Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ending 30 January 2011 of 8.37p per share which will absorb an estimated 222m of shareholders funds.
Subject to approval at the AGM, it will be paid on 15 June 2011 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 13 May 2011.
A dividend reinvestment plan is available in respect of the final dividend.
c Company investment On 9 March 2011, the Group made a 32m investment to acquire a c10% stake in FreshDirect, an internet grocer serving the New York market.
