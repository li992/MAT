Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date when the fair value was determined.
Pensions The Company is the principal employer of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, a funded defined benefit group plan.
The pension cost relating to the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Any actuarial gains or losses are taken to equity in the period in which they arise.
Any past service costs are recognised immediately to the extent that benefits have already vested and, otherwise, are amortised on a straight line basis over the average period until the benefits vest.
The defined benefit asset recognised in the balance sheet represents the fair value of plan assets less the present value of defined benefit obligations as adjusted for any unrecognised past service costs.
If necessary, the net defined benefit surplus is limited to the amount that can be recovered through reduced Company contributions in the future plus any refunds that have been agreed at the balance sheet date.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Share-based payments The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model, further details of which are given in note 31 of the consolidated IFRSs financial statements.
In valuing equity settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of Ladbrokes plc market conditions.
The cost of equity settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date, based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments, will ultimately vest.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
ESOP trusts Where the Company holds its own equity shares through an ESOP trust these shares are shown as a reduction in equity.
Any consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of these shares is shown in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds and no gain or loss is recognised within the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses on the purchase, sale or cancellation of these shares.
Treasury shares Own equity instruments that are reacquired treasury shares are deducted from equity.
No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Companys own equity instruments.

The Company received an indemnity from Hilton Hotels Corporation HHC, at the time of the hotels disposal, in relation to any loss the Company may subsequently incur under these third party guarantees.
The guarantees expire between 2012 and 2042 and the lease liabilities comprise a combination of minimum contractual and turnover based elements.
The undiscounted maximum liability exposure in respect of the guarantees for all periods up to 2042 is 860.6 million 2010: 901.2 million, with a maximum indemnity receivable of the same amount.
Included in the maximum liability exposure is 490.7 million 2010: 505.9 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 369.9 million 2010: 395.3 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The undiscounted maximum liability represents the total of all guaranteed rentals under the non-cancellable agreements into which the Company has entered.
The net present value of the maximum exposure at 31 December 2011 is 357.1 million 2010: 385.9 million.
Included in the net present value of the maximum exposure is 183.3 million 2010: 193.4 million in relation to the turnover based element of the hotel rentals and 173.8 million 2010: 192.5 million in relation to the minimum contractual based element.
The Company monitors its exposure under these guarantees on a regular basis and seeks, where appropriate, to novate its obligations.
The financial guarantees liability has been valued using a probability based model to estimate the net present value of the liabilities payable in the event of a default by the hotels covered by the guarantees, and the probability of such a default and new tenants being identified.
At 31 December 2011 the Company has recognised a financial liability of 7.7 million 2010: 8.1 million in respect of these guarantees.
The reduction is due to time lapse.
No asset has been recognised in respect of the indemnity at 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
The key assumption in the probability model is the hotels default rate.
A 0.5 percentage point increase in the default rate would increase the financial liability by 1.3 million.

15 Pensions The Companys main pension plan is the Ladbrokes Pension Plan.
This was closed to new employees on 1 August 2007.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out with an effective date of 30 June 2010.
The latest actuarial valuation was updated to 31 December 2011 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with FRS 17.
The defined benefit obligations and current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
In July 2010, the Government announced that in future statutory indexation for pensions would be linked to the Consumer Prices Index CPI rather than the, historically, higher Retail Prices Index RPI.
The effect of this change was to reduce the Companys pension liabilities.
To reflect this, in the prior year the Company recognised an actuarial gain of 8.6 million outside profit and loss through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In the current year, following further government publications, it has been concluded by the Company that the gap between the RPI and the CPI is expected over the long-term to be 1.0% pa compared to 0.7% pa assumed at 31 December 2010 thus further reducing the value of the Companys pension liabilities.
To reflect this, the Company has recognised a further actuarial gain of 3.5 million through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The following table sets out the key FRS 17 principle assumptions used for the plan.
The table also sets out at 31 December 2011 and 31December 2010, the fair value of assets, a breakdown of the assets into the main asset classes, the present value of the FRS 17 liabilities, the surplus or deficit of assets compared to the FRS 17 liabilities, the related deferred tax liability or asset and the net pension asset or liability.

The sources used to determine the expected rates of return include: bond yields, inflation and investment market expectations derived from market data and analysts or governments expectations.
The contributions made by the employers in 2011, in respect of the Ladbrokes Pension Plan, were 7.9 million 2010: 6.7 million.
The currently agreed level of employer contributions is 22.2% of pensionable payroll, plus an additional 441,667 per month to remove the shortfall in funding identified at 30 June 2010 and 62,500 per month towards the regular expenses of maintaining the plan.
These lead to an expected contribution of 9.9 million in 2012.
As the plan is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the service cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase over time as the average age of the membership increases.
The following table sets out the amounts charged to the profit and loss account and directly in equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17, together with the prior year comparative.

In addition, subsidiaries have guaranteed loans of 0.1 million 2010: 0.1 million given in the normal course of business to other subsidiary companies and companies in which they hold minority equity investments.
Bank guarantees have been issued on behalf of subsidiaries and joint ventures with a value of 22.1 million 2010: 24.0 million.
