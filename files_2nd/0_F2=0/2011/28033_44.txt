Policy on Directors Remuneration The Boards policy is that the remuneration of non-executive Directors should be fair and reasonable in relation to the time commitment and responsibilities of the Director.

Since 1 April 2010, Directors remuneration per annum has been as follows: 30,000 Chairman: 25,000 Audit Chairman: and 20,000 other Directors.
Prior to this increase, the last Directors remuneration increase was in July 2006.
Fees for the Directors are determined by the Board within the limits stated in the Companys Articles of Association.
As at 31 March 2011, the maximum dictated by the Companys Articles of Association was 200,000 in aggregate per annum.
The Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits, share options or other incentives or benefits.
