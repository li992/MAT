24 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Groups investing activities undertaken in pursuit of its investment objective, as set out on page 16, involve certain inherent risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding periods.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups business.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on seven scheduled occasions in each year and at each meeting it receives sufficient financial and statistical information to enable it to monitor adequately the investment performance and status of the business.
In addition, financial information is circulated to the directors on a monthly basis.
The Board has also established a series of investment parameters, which are reviewed annually, designed to limit the risk inherent in managing a portfolio of investments.
The Groups borrowings have the effect of increasing the risk faced by shareholders.
This gearing effect is such that, for example, for a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups investments, the net assets attributable to shareholders would move by approximately 11.1%.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments that arise as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through retained profits including capital profits, and additional financing is obtained through the two debenture stocks in issue, on which interest is paid at a fixed rate.
Liquidity risk The Groups assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of cash balances and short-term bank deposits.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that one party to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation and cause the other party to incur a financial loss.
This is mitigated by the Manager reviewing the credit ratings of broker counterparties.
The risk attached to dividend flows is mitigated by the Managers research of potential investee companies.
The Groups custodian bank is responsible for the collection of income on behalf of the Group.
Cash is held either with reputable banks with high quality external credit enhancements or in liquidity cash funds providing a spread of exposures to various underlying banks in order to diversify risk.

The key areas where foreign currency risk could have an impact on the Group are: movements in rates affect the value of investments and liabilities: and movements in rates affect the income received.
The Group had the following currency exposures all of which are included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at fair value based on the exchange rates ruling at the respective year-ends.
At 31 December 2010 the Group also hedged its risk against the Euro but the sensitivity to the US dollar was as follows based on an assumed 2% movement 000 000 Projected movement 2% -2% Effect on net assets for the year 1,336 1,309 Effect on capital return 616 604 Financial assets Interest rate risk The majority of the Groups financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date with the exception of the Groups fixed interest holdings which have a market value of 51,892,000, representing 9.94% of net assets of 522,040,000 2010: 42,733,000: 7.91%.
The weighted average running yield as at 31 December 2011 was 6.4% 2010: 6.8% and the weighted average remaining life was 6.2 years 2010: 4.4 years.
The Groups cash balance of 3,883,000 2010: 1,974,000 earns interest, calculated on a tiered basis, depending on the balance held, by reference to the base rate.
If the bank base rate had increased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss and net assets would have been a positive 19,415 2010: 9,870.
If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5%, the impact on the profit or loss and net assets would have been a negative 19,415 2010: negative 9,870.
The calculations are based on the cash balances at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Financial liabilities Interest rate risk All of the Groups financial liabilities of 64,525,000 2010: 65,032,000 are denominated in Sterling.
All current liabilities have no interest rate and are repayable within one year.
The 9.875% debenture stock and the 5.5% debenture stock, which are repayable in 2017 and 2021 respectively, pay interest at fixed rates.
The weighted average period until maturity of the debenture stocks is 8 years 2010: 9 years and the weighted average interest rate payable is 7.2% 2010: 7.2% p. a.
The Group also has recourse to a 25 million overdraft facility with HSBC Bank, which was undrawn at the year end and throughout the year.
