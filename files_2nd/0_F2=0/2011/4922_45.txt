fide Notes to the Group financial statements continued 19. Business combinations continued Under the terms of the acquisition, the Group purchased a 75% interest in Dominos Germany for a total consideration of 2,200,000 ordinary shares, 1,320,000 payable on completion and a further 880,000 on the opening of the 35th Dominos store in Germany.
There was no cash outflow arising on acquisition.
Costs of 1,232,000 directly attributable to the acquisition have been recognised in the income statement in accordance with IFRS 3R and are included within exceptional items note 7.
The goodwill arising on acquisition is in respect of the opportunities in the German market.
From the date of acquisition, Dominos Germany has contributed a loss of 1,399,000 to the Group.
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the financial period, the profit before tax excluding exceptional items would have been 41,318,000 and revenue from continuing operations would have been 210,225,000.
The goodwill acquired through the acquisition of Dominos Germany has been allocated for impairment testing to the Germany cash generating unit.
The Group performed its annual impairment test for this goodwill as at 25 December 2011.
The recoverable amount of the Germany cash generating unit has been determined based on fair value calculated using discounted future cash flows due to the growth phase of the business.
Future cash flows are based on the Groups business plan.
The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 12.5% and cash flows beyond the ten year financial model are extrapolated using a 2.0% growth rate.
The calculation of the fair value is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Discount rates Store openings in Germany Foreign exchange rates The discount rate reflects managements estimate of the return on capital employed for the investment in Germany.
The store openings in Germany are based on the current business model being used by management, which is progressing in line with expectations.
The foreign exchange rate used is the average Euro exchange rate for the 52 weeks ended 25 December 2011.
The fair value calculation results in headroom in excess of the carrying value of goodwill and therefore no impairment is required.
As at 25 December 2011, no reasonably expected change in the above assumptions would give rise to an impairment charge.
