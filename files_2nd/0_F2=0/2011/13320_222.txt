Notes to the parent company accounts The company has a committed 270 million revolving credit facility which expires in December 2016 and which accrues interest at LIBOR for the period drawn plus a margin.
The cost of borrowing under the RCF at the year end was 2.1%.
The companys RCF, bank borrowings and bonds are held at amortised cost.
The 300 million bond was revalued for changes in interest rates during the period March 2006 to April 2009, during which the company paid floating interest rates.
At the end of this period, the company reverted to paying fixed interest rates and revaluation of the bond ceased as the hedge relationship ended.
The bond is recorded in the financial statements at amortised cost and revaluation differences are amortised to the consolidated income statement over the life of the bond thus producing the effective rate indicated above.
