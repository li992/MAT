Litigation guarantee Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements on pages 82 and 83 outlines the background and status of the F&C Partners litigation.
A provision of 2.4m was recognised during 2009 as the Company had guaranteed any amounts validly due to the founder members in respect of the put option, to the extent that F&C Alternative Investment Holdings F&C AIH is unable to meet such obligations.
However, the provision was released in 2010 as F&C AIH had sufficient resources available to it to meet any amount payable in respect of a valid put option claim by the two founder members of Partners.
The put option liability was settled during 2011.
The Company now has a joint legal obligation with F&C AIH to settle any litigation amounts payable to the founder partners.
As a result, the Company has recognised an amount of 2.0m as being potentially payable, in line with the provision recognised in note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
