Both components have the same performance targets based on net asset value per share growth and a three-year service period.
For both LTIP components the Company estimates the number of shares or options likely to vest and expenses that estimate over the relevant period.
Performance shares are valued at the market value at the date of the award.
The options are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends, see table below.
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the Companys share price over a four-year period and adjusting where there are known factors that may affect future volatility.
No other features of the option grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.

The Company expenses the estimated number of shares likely to vest over the three-year period based on the market price at the date of grant.
Fund Managers Performance Plan FMPP Under the FMPP the Company may award employees a combination of cash 20% of the award and shares based on a maximum of 30% of the annual performance fee earned by the Unit Trusts and, as agreed by shareholders in 2008, in respect of a comparative notional pool for British Land-owned portfolios.
The cash is awarded following the performance year under review with the shares released over the following three years subject to clawback due to subsequent property underperformance.
The Company expenses an estimate of the fair value of the award over the period to full vesting.
Other Share Plans Under the SIP the Company gives eligible employees free shares of up to 3,000 a year.
They can also purchase partnership shares for up to 1,500 a year that are matched 2 for 1 by the Company.
The free and matching shares are either purchased at fair value in the market or allotted from authorised share capital and expensed at the time of allocation.
Under the Sharesave Plans eligible employees can save up to 250 a month over a threeor five-year period and use the savings to exercise an option granted at the outset at a 20% discount to the then prevailing share price.
The fair value of the various options is expensed over the service period, based on a Black-Scholes model.
Awards under the four recruitment schemes are valued at the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and expensed over the period to vesting.
Movements in shares and options are given in note 21.
