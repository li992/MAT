The table below provides further operating decision maker CODM so that the CODM can make decisions about resources to be allocated to segments and to assess their analysis of the consolidated income statement showing the results of trading activities separately from these other items.
The groups CODM is the chief executive officer.
The group has identified five segments and is treating all of these as reportable segments.
The segments are: UK residential: retirement 2011 2010 solutions: fund management and residential investments: UK and European development and German residential.
The group has a NonNonTrading Valuation recurring Total Trading Valuation recurring Total segment director responsible for the performance of each of these five segments and the group reports key financial information to the m m m m m m m m CODM on the basis of these five segments.
Each of these five segments operate within a different part of the overall residential market.

The CODM reviews by segment two key balance sheet measures of net asset value.
These are gross net asset value NAV and triple net asset value NNNAV.
Net gain on acquisition of subsidiary 16.1 16.1 2.8 2.8 Goodwill impairment 2.2 2.2 1.5 1.5 The adoption of IFRS 8 in the prior year resulted in several changes to the groups segmental information.
Major changes were to combine Profit on disposal of investment property 1.1 1.1 0.4 0.4 UK and European development into a single segment, to change the basis of the segment operating profit loss and to show NAV and NNNAV by segment in addition to statutory net assets by segment.
In the current year we have included segmental information relating to Profit on redemption of equity units the previously disclosed Property Services segment within UK residential and fund management and residential investments on the in associate 1.0 1.0 grounds of materiality as outlined within IFRS 8.

There are no other material revenue streams from external customers in foreign countries.
Non-current assets other than financial instruments, deferred tax assets, post-employment benefit assets and rights arising under insurance contracts are located as follows: 462.9m within the UK 2010: 319.1m 422.0m in Germany 2010: 442.7m The majority of the groups properties are held as trading stock and are therefore shown in the statutory balance sheet at the lower cost and net realisable value.
This does not reflect the market value of the assets and, accordingly, our key balance sheet measures of net asset value includes trading stock at market value.
The two principal net asset value measures reviewed by the CODM are gross net asset value NAV and triple net asset value NNNAV.
NAV is the statutory net assets plus the adjustment required to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
In addition, the statutory balance sheet amounts for both deferred tax on property revaluations and derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are added back to statutory net assets.
Finally, the market value of Grainger plc shares owned by the group are added back to statutory net assets.
NNNAV reverses some of the adjustments made between statutory net assets and NAV.
All of the adjustments for the value of derivative financial instruments net of deferred tax, including those in joint ventures and associates, are reversed.
The adjustment for the deferred tax on property revaluations is also reversed.
In addition, adjustments are made to net assets to reflect the fair value, net of deferred tax, of the groups fixed rate debt and to deduct from net assets the contingent tax calculated by applying the expected rate of tax to the adjustment to increase the value of trading stock from its statutory accounts value of the lower of cost and net realisable value, to its market value.
These measures are set out below by segment along with a reconciliation to the summarised statutory balance sheet.
