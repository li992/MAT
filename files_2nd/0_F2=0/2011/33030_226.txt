The provision for the costs of decommissioning these wells, production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices or future assumptions, depending on the expected timing of the activity, and discounted using a real discount rate of 0.5% 2010 1.5%.
These costs are generally expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or on closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 0.5% 2010 1.5%.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of the liability.
The litigation category includes provisions for matters related to, for example, commercial disputes, product liability, and allegations of exposures of third parties to toxic substances.
Included within the other category at 31 December 2011 are provisions for deferred employee compensation of $666 million 2010 $728 million.
These provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 2.5% 2010 3.75% or a real discount rate of 0.5% 2010 1.5%, as appropriate.
Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill The Gulf of Mexico oil spill is described on pages 76 to 79 and in Note 2.
Provisions relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, included in the table above, are separately presented below: $ million Litigation and Clean Water Environmental Spill response claims Act penalties Total At 1 January 2011 809 1,043 10,973 3,510 16,335 New or increased provisions 1,167 586 3,430 5,183 Unwinding of discount 6 6 Change in discount rate 17 17 Utilization 482 1,293 4,433 6,208 At 31 December 2011 1,517 336 9,970 3,510 15,333 Of which current 961 282 8,194 9,437 non-current 556 54 1,776 3,510 5,896 Of which payable from the trust fund 1,066 8,809 9,875 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 231 Notes on financial statements 36.

The total amounts that will ultimately be paid by BP are subject to significant uncertainty as described in Note 2.
Subsequent to BP releasing its preliminary announcement of the fourth quarter 2011 results on 7 February 2012, BP announced on 3 March 2012 that it had reached a proposed settlement with the Plaintiffs Steering Committee PSC, subject to final written agreement and court approvals, to resolve the substantial majority of legitimate economic loss and medical claims stemming from the Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill.
The proposed settlement has been reected in the financial statements for 2011 included in this report.
Certain items are subject to settlement discussions or may be subject to settlement discussions in the future.
Any further settlements which may be reached relating to the Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill could impact the amount and timing of any future payments.
Environmental The amounts committed by BP for a 10-year research programme to study the impact of the incident on the marine and shoreline environment of the Gulf of Mexico have been provided for.
BPs commitment is to provide $500 million of funding, and the remaining commitment, on a discounted basis, of $421 million was included in provisions at 31 December 2011.
This amount is expected to be spent over the remaining life of the programme.
As a responsible party under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90, BP faces claims by the United States, as well as by State, tribal, and foreign trustees, if any, for natural resource damages Natural Resource Damages claims.
These damages include, among other things, the reasonable costs of assessing the injury to natural resources as well as some emergency restoration projects which are expected to occur over the next two years.
BP has been incurring natural resource damage assessment costs and a provision has been made for the estimated costs of the assessment phase.
The assessment covers a large area of potential impact and will take some time to complete in order to determine both the severity and duration of the impact of the oil spill.
The process of interpreting the large volume of data collected is expected to take at least several months and, in order to determine potential injuries to certain animal populations, data will need to be collected over one or more reproductive cycles.
This expected assessment spend is based upon past experience as well as identied projects.
During 2011, BP entered a framework agreement with natural resource trustees for the United States and five Gulf Coast states, providing for up to $1 billion to be spent on early restoration projects to address natural resource injuries resulting from the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.
Funding for these projects will come from the $20-billion trust fund.
The total amount provided for these items was $1,096 million at 31 December 2011.
Until the size, location and duration of the impact is assessed, it is not possible to estimate reliably either the amounts or timing of the remaining Natural Resource Damages claims other than the emergency and early restoration agreements noted above, therefore no amounts have been provided for these items and they are disclosed as a contingent liability.
See Note 43 for further information.
Spill response Further amounts were provided relating to the spill response during 2011, totalling $0.6 billion.
This primarily reected increased costs of shoreline clean-up, patrolling and maintenance and vessel decontamination.
The majority of the active clean-up of the shorelines had been completed by the end of the year.
Litigation and claims Individual and Business Claims, and State and Local Claims under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 OPA 90 and claims for personal injury BP faces claims under OPA 90 by individuals and businesses for removal costs, damage to real or personal property, lost profits or impairment of earning capacity, loss of subsistence use of natural resources and for personal injury Individual and Business Claims and by state and local government entities for removal costs, physical damage to real or personal property, loss of government revenue and increased public services costs State and Local Claims.
The estimated future cost of settling Individual and Business Claims, State and Local Claims under OPA 90 and claims for personal injuries, both reported and unreported, has been provided for.
Claims administration costs and legal fees have also been provided for.
Subsequent to BP releasing its preliminary announcement of the fourth quarter 2011 results on 7 February 2012, BP announced on 3 March 2012 that it had reached a proposed settlement with the PSC, subject to final written agreement and court approvals, to resolve the substantial majority of legitimate economic loss and medical claims stemming from the Deepwater Horizon accident and oil spill.
The details of the proposed settlement agreement are explained in Legal proceedings on pages 160 to 164.
In 2010 and for the 2011 preliminary results, BP believed that the history of claims received, and settlements made, provided sufficient data to enable the company to use an approach based on a combination of actuarial methods and management judgements to estimate IBNR Incurred But Not Reported claims to determine a reliable best estimate of BPs exposure for claims not yet reported in relation to Individual and Business claims, and State and Local claims under OPA 90.
The amount provided for these claims was determined in accordance with IFRS and represented BPs best estimate of the expenditure required to settle its obligations at the balance sheet date.
In estimating the amount of the provision, BP determined a range of possible outcomes for Individual and Business Claims, and State and Local Claims.
As disclosed in the preliminary announcement of the fourth quarter 2011 results, BP had concluded that a reasonable range of possible outcomes for the amount of the provision as at 31 December 2011 was $4.1 billion to $8.3 billion.
This range was for claims payable through the Gulf Coast Claims Facility and State and Local Claims only.

Provisions continued Following the proposed settlement agreement entered into with the PSC, subject to final written agreement and court approvals, BP reviewed the amount of the provision for the items covered by the proposed settlement based upon information available at the time that the consolidated financial statements were approved.
The provision for these items at 31 December 2011 is now $7.8 billion which represents a reliable best estimate of the liability under the proposed settlement agreement which, under accounting standards, is the amount that BP would rationally pay to settle the obligation.
Substantially all of this amount is included as payable from the trust fund under Litigation and claims in the table above.
Future claims administration costs are expected to be paid from the trust fund.
However, at this time, the provision for these costs is shown as payable from outside the trust fund, consistent with how the administration costs associated with the GCCF were treated, as the proposed settlement is subject to final written agreement and court approvals.
Further information on the proposed settlement with the PSC is included in Legal proceedings on pages 160 to 164.
The provision is in addition to the $6.3 billion of claims paid in total $2.9 billion in 2011 and $3.4 billion in 2010.
Of this total paid, $6.1 billion is included within utilization of provision in the table $2.9 billion in 2011 and $3.2 billion in 2010, and the remaining $0.2 billion was a period expenditure prior to the recognition of the provision at the end of the second quarter 2010.
Also included within the utilization of the provision of $4.4 billion 2010 $4.0 billion under Litigation and claims in the table are amounts relating to claims administration costs, legal fees and other settlements.
Of the total payments of $6.3 billion, $5.9 billion was paid out of the trust fund $2.9 billion in 2011 and $3.0 billion in 2010 and $0.4 billion was paid by BP in 2010.
Many key assumptions underlie and inuence the reliable best estimates of total expenditures derived for both categories of claims.
The amount provided for Individual and Business Claims is based upon the expected terms of the proposed settlement with the PSC, which is subject to final written agreement and court approvals.
Other key assumptions include the amounts that will ultimately be paid in relation to current claims, the number, type and amounts for claims not yet reported, the outcomes of any further litigation through potential opt-outs from the proposed settlement and the amount of administration and other costs associated with the proposed settlement.
While BP has determined a reliable best estimate of the cost of the proposed settlement with the PSC, it is possible that the actual cost could be higher or lower than this estimate.
The outcomes of claims and litigation are likely to be paid out over many years to come.
BP will re-evaluate the assumptions underlying this analysis on a quarterly basis as more information becomes available and the claims process matures.
BP also faces other litigation for which no reliable estimate of the cost can currently be made.
Therefore no amounts have been provided for these items.
Clean Water Act penalties A provision has been made for the estimated penalties for strict liability under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act.
Such penalties are subject to a statutory maximum calculated as the product of a per-barrel maximum penalty rate and the number of barrels of oil spilled.
Uncertainties currently exist in relation to both the per-barrel penalty rate that will ultimately be imposed and the volume of oil spilled.
A charge for potential Clean Water Act Section 311 penalties was first included in BPs second-quarter 2010 interim financial statements.
At the time that charge was taken, the latest estimate from the intra-agency Flow Rate Technical Group created by the National Incident Commander in charge of the spill response was between 35,000 and 60,000 barrels per day.
The mid-point of that range, 47,500 barrels per day, was used for the purposes of calculating the charge.
For the purposes of calculating the amount of the oil ow that was discharged into the Gulf of Mexico, the amount of oil that had been or was projected to be captured in vessels on the surface was subtracted from the total estimated ow up until when the well was capped on 15 July 2010.
The result of this calculation was an estimate that approximately 3.2 million barrels of oil had been discharged into the Gulf.
This estimate of 3.2 million barrels was calculated using a total ow of 47,500 barrels per day multiplied by the 85 days from 22 April 2010 through 15 July 2010 less an estimate of the amount captured on the surface then estimated at approximately 850,000 barrels.
This estimated discharge volume was then multiplied by $1,100 per barrel the maximum amount the statute allows in the absence of gross negligence or wilful misconduct for the purposes of estimating a potential penalty.
This resulted in a provision of $3,510 million for potential penalties under Section 311.
In utilizing the $1,100 per-barrel input, BP took into account that the actual per-barrel penalty a court may impose, or that the Government might agree to in settlement, could be lower than $1,100 per barrel if it were determined that such a lower penalty was appropriate based on the factors a court is directed to consider in assessing a penalty.
In particular, in determining the amount of a civil penalty, Section 311 directs a court to consider a number of enumerated factors, including the seriousness of the violation or violations, the economic benefit to the violator, if any, resulting from the violation, the degree of culpability involved, any other penalty for the same incident, any history of prior violations, the nature, extent, and degree of success of any efforts of the violator to minimize or mitigate the effects of the discharge, the economic impact of the penalty on the violator, and any other matters as justice may require.
Civil penalties above $1,100 per barrel up to a statutory maximum of $4,300 per barrel of oil discharged would only be imposed if gross negligence or wilful misconduct were alleged and subsequently proven.
BP expects to seek assessment of a penalty lower than $1,100 per barrel based on several of these factors.
However, the $1,100 per-barrel rate was utilized for the purposes of calculating a charge after considering and weighing all possible outcomes and in light of: i BPs conclusion that it did not act with gross negligence or engage in wilful misconduct: and ii the uncertainty as to whether a court would assess a penalty below the $1,100 statutory maximum.
On 2 August 2010, the United States Department of Energy and the Flow Rate Technical Group had issued an estimate that 4.9 million barrels of oil had owed from the Macondo well, and 4.05 million barrels had been discharged into the Gulf the difference being the amount of oil captured by vessels on the surface as part of BPs well containment efforts.
It was and remains BPs view, that the 2 August 2010 Government estimate and other similar estimates are not reliable estimates because they are based on incomplete or inaccurate information, rest in large part on assumptions that have not been validated, and are subject to far greater uncertainties than have been acknowledged.
As BP has publicly asserted, including at a 22 October 2010 meeting with the staff of the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling, BP believes that the 2 August 2010 discharge estimate and similar estimates are overstated by a significant amount, and that the ow rate is potentially in the range of 2050% lower.
If the ow rate is 50% lower than the 2 August 2010 estimate, then the amount of oil that owed from the Macondo well would be approximately 2.5 million barrels, and the amount discharged into the Gulf would be approximately 1.6 million barrels.
If the ow rate is 20% lower than the 2 August 2010 estimate, then the amount of oil that owed from the Macondo well would be approximately 3.9 million barrels and the amount discharged into the Gulf would be approximately 3.1 million barrels, which is not materially different from the amount we used for our original estimate at the second quarter of 2010.
