In addition for 2010, operating profit excluded costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction and the gain arising upon the dilution of the Groups holding in PruHealth.
The amounts for these items are included in total EEV profit attributable to shareholders.
The Company believes that operating profit, as adjusted for these items, better reflects underlying performance.
Profit before tax and basic earnings per share include these items together with actual investment returns.
This basis of presentation has been adopted consistently throughout this supplementary information.
ii The value of future profits or losses from asset management and service companies that support the Groups covered businesses are included in the profits for new business and the in-force value of the Groups long-term business.
The results of the Groups asset management operations include the profits from the management of internal and external funds.
For EEV basis reporting, Group shareholders other income is adjusted to deduct the unwind of the expected margin for the year arising from the management of the assets of the covered business as defined in note 1 a.
The deduction is on a basis consistent with that used for projecting the results for covered business.
Group operating profit accordingly includes the variance between actual and expected profit in respect of covered business.
iii In 2011 the Group altered its inflation measure basis for future statutory increases to pension payments for certain tranches of its UK defined benefit pension schemes.
This reflects the UK Governments decision to replace the basis of indexation from RPI with CPI.
This resulted in a credit to operating profit for 2011 on an IFRS basis of 42 million and an additional 3 million recognised on the EEV basis.
iv Restructuring costs comprise the charge of 16 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 3 million recognised on the EEV basis for the shareholders share of restructuring costs incurred by the PAC with-profits fund.
Solvency II implementation costs comprise the charge of 55 million recognised on an IFRS basis and an additional 1 million recognised on the EEV basis.
v For 2010, new business profits for the Groups Japanese insurance subsidiary, which ceased writing new business with effect from 15 February 2010, have been presented separately from those of the remainder of the Group.
vi The comparative results have been prepared using previously reported average exchange rates for the year.
