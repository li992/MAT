Acquisitions continued Acquisition of Duffer of St George Limited On 24 November 2009, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Duffer of St George Limited for a cash consideration of 863,000.
Duffer of St George Limited owns the global rights to the brand name The Duffer of St George.
During the 12 month period following acquisition, no measurement adjustments have been made to the provisional fair values of the net assets of Duffer of St George Limited as at the acquisition date.
Provisional fair value at Fair value Fair value at 30 January 2010 adjustments 29 January 2011 000 000 000 Acquiree's net assets at the acquisition date: Intangible assets 2,042 - 2,042 Trade and other receivables 220 - 220 Cash and cash equivalents 212 - 212 Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 1,616 - 1,616 Deferred tax asset 5 - 5 Net identifiable assets 863 - 863 Goodwill on acquisition - - - Consideration paid - satisfied in cash 863 - 863 12.
Disposals Disposal of 25% of issued ordinary share capital of Canterbury International Australia Pty Limited On 28 January 2011, Canterbury Limited disposed of 25% of the issued ordinary share capital of Canterbury International Australia Pty Limited to the local management team by issuing new shares in exchange for a cash consideration of AUD $1,100,000.
This takes the Groups shareholding to 75%.
As the Group has maintained control of Canterbury International Australia Pty Limited, the decrease in Group ownership has been accounted for as an equity transaction.
Intangible assets continued Goodwill impairment The impairment in the prior period related to the residual goodwill on the acquisition in the year to 29 January 2005 of the entire issued share capital of RD Scott Limited.
An initial impairment of 2,000,000 was recognised in the year to 27 January 2007.
Although the performance of the business had improved since this point, it had not progressed sufficiently to justify carrying the remaining goodwill and so the remaining balance of 2,617,000 was impaired in the year to 30 January 2010.

The CGUs used are either the store portfolios or distribution businesses acquired.
The recoverable amount is compared to the carrying amount of the CGU including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The carrying amount of goodwill by CGU is shown below: GROUP COMPANY 2010 restated - 2011 see note 1 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Allsports store portfolio 924 924 924 924 First Sport store portfolio 14,976 14,976 14,976 14,976 Bank store portfolio 14,154 14,154 - - Topgrade Sportswear Limited 17 17 - - Nicholas Deakins Limited 864 864 - - Kooga Rugby Limited 1,537 1,537 - - 32,472 32,472 15,900 15,900 The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are set out below: In relation to the Allsports store portfolio, First Sport store portfolio and Bank store portfolio, the cash flow projections are based on actual operating results, together with financial forecasts and strategy plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These forecasts and plans are based on both past performance and expectations for future market development.
Cash flows beyond this five year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.0% 2010: 2.0% which is an estimate of the growth based on past experience within the Group In relation to Nicholas Deakins Limited and Kooga Rugby Limited the cash flow projections are based on actual divisional operating results together with financial forecasts and strategy plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
These forecasts are based on both past performance and expectations for future development.
Cash flows beyond this five year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.0% 2010: 2.0% which is an estimate based on past experience The discount rate of 14.9% 2010: 12.7% is pre-tax and reflects the specific risks and costs of capital of the Group 77 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 13.
Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for intangible assets with infinite lives Intangible assets with infinite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
Fascia name The recoverable amount of the Bank fascia name is determined based on a value-in-use method of valuation.
The carrying value of the Bank intangible assets are compared with the present value of future cash flows generated by the store portfolio.
The cash flow projections are based on actual operating results, together with financial forecasts and strategy plans approved by the Board covering a five year period.
Cash flows beyond this five year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2.0% 2010: 2.0% which is an estimate of the growth based on past experience within the Group.
The discount rate of 14.9% 2010: 12.7% is pre-tax and reflects the specific risks and costs of capital of the Group.
Impairment tests for intangible assets with definite lives Intangible assets with definite lives are tested annually for impairment by comparing the recoverable amount to their carrying value.
Brand names The recoverable amount of brand names is determined based on a royalty relief method of valuation, which takes projected future sales, applies a royalty rate to them and discounts the projected future post-tax royalties to arrive at a net present value.
The Group has used a pre-tax discount rate of 14.9% 2010: 12.7% to reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the assets, for which the future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
Projected future sales are based on Board approved forecasts up to five years, and subsequent sales projections assume an annual growth up to 2.0% over the remaining life of the brand names.
Brand licences The recoverable amount of brand licences is based on an estimation of future sales and other specific cash flows, the contracted royalty rate and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
The Group has used a pre-tax discount rate of 14.9% 2010: 12.7% to reflect the risks specific to the assets, for which future cash flow estimates have not been adjusted.
Projected future sales are based on a three year Board approved forecast.
Subsequent sales projections assume an annual growth of 5.0% for the following two years and then 2.0% over the remaining licence period.
Sensitivity analysis A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill.
For the Kooga Rugby Limited cash-generating unit, changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Board has considered the possibility of the business achieving less revenue and gross profit than budgeted.
Whilst the reduction in revenue would be partially offset by a reduction in revenue related costs, the Board would also take actions to mitigate the loss of gross profit by reducing other costs.
Should the business have a 1.0% reduction in forecast gross profit and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in value-in-use would lead to an impairment of 445,000.
A reduction from 2.0% to nil in the growth rate, beyond the five year Board approved financial forecast and strategy plan, with no actions taken to change the cost structure forecast, would lead to an additional impairment of 95,000.
For the Bank goodwill cash-generating unit, changes in key assumptions could cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
Should the business have a 5.0% reduction in forecast revenue and be unable to reduce selling and distribution and administrative costs, the reduction in valuein-use would lead to an impairment of 1,160,000.
All other assumptions remain unchanged.
With regards to the assessment of value-in-use of all other cash-generating units, the Board believe that there are no reasonably possible changes in any of the key assumptions, which would cause the carrying value of the unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
