Related party transactions The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of BT Group Investments Limited, which is the immediate parent company.
BT Group Investments Limited is a wholly owned subsidiary of the ultimate holding company and controlling entity, BT Group plc.
Copies of the ultimate holding companys financial statements may be obtained from The Secretary, BT Group plc, 81 Newgate Street, London EC1A 7AJ.
The results of the company are included in the consolidated financial statements of BT Group plc.
Consequently, the company is exempt under the terms of FRS 8, Related Party Disclosures, from disclosing details of transactions and balances with BT Group plc, fellow subsidiaries and associated undertakings, and other companies which are deemed to be under common control.
Financial commitments and contingent liabilities 2011 2010 At 31 March m m Contracts placed for capital expenditure not provided in the accounts 455 368 Operating lease payments payable within one year of the balance sheet date were in respect of leases expiring: Within one year 25 22 Between one and five years 100 123 After five years 337 340 Total payable within one year 462 485 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings which arose from a sale and operating leaseback transaction in a prior period.
Leases have an average term of 21 years 2010: 22 years and rentals are xed for an average of 21 years 2010: 22 years.
At 31 March 2011, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefonica UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure was US$128m as at 31 March 2011 2010: US$132m, approximately 80m 2010: 87m, although this could increase by a further US$268m 2010: US$304m, approximately 167m 2010: 200m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefonica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
We do not believe that there is any single current court action that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the group.
During 2011 the aggregate volume and value of legal actions for which the group is party has remained broadly the same as at the end of 2010, during which the levels had increased signicantly.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK Government set the rates payable on BTs infrastructure and those paid by KCOM, and whether or not the UK Government complied with EU rules on state aid.
The Commission concluded in October 2006 that no state aid had been granted was appealed.
In January 2011, the appeal was rejected as inadmissible.

Subsequent to that date new entrants have been able to join a dened contribution plan, initially the BT Retirement Plan BTRP and since 1 April 2009 the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract based dened contribution arrangement, to which BTRP members were invited to transfer their accumulated assets.

The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risk.
6m 2010: 6m, 2009: 4m of contributions to dened contribution scheme were outstanding at 31 March 2011.
Dened benefit plans BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed of the BTPS, there are nine Trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the Chairman of the Trustee.
Four Trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the Trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the Trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment the Trustee.

This includes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and non-financial assumptions such as life expectancy.
Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustments on the dened benefit obligation represent the impact on the liability of differences between actual experience during the year compared to the assumptions made.
Such differences might arise, for example, from actual salary increases being different from those assumed, or members choosing different benefit options at retirement.
Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustments on plan assets represents the difference between actual investment performance in the year and the expected rate of return on assets assumed at the start of the year.

Retirement benets continued The rate of ination inuences the assumptions for salary and pension increases.
In assessing the appropriate assumption for pension increases, management have considered the announcement in July 2010 by the UK Government that the Consumer Prices Index CPI, rather than RPI, will be used as the basis for determining the rate of ination for the statutory minimum rate of revaluation and indexation of occupational pension rights.
The impact of using CPI instead of RPI is to reduce BTPS liabilities at 31 March 2011 by 3.5bn.
In determining the most appropriate manner by which to reect the impact of the change on the scheme liabilities, the directors have had regard to the UITF Abstract 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the Retail Prices Index with the Consumer Prices Index for retirement benets issued by the Urgent Issues Task Force of the UK Accounting Standards Board in December 2010.
The Abstract states that, where the obligation is to pay pensions with increases based on a general measure of ination rather than a measure linked specically to RPI, a change in the ination assumption represents an actuarial gain or loss rather than a cost relating to past service of employees.
Accordingly, the gain on re-measurement of the liabilities of the BTPS to reect CPI as the ination measure is recorded as an actuarial gain in equity shareholders funds in 2011.
Cash contributions to the BTPS The company has made the following contributions to the BTPS: 2011 2010 Year ended 31 March m m Ordinary contributions 266 384 deficit contributions 1,030 525 Total contributions in the year 1,296 909 The company expects to contribute approximately 135m to the BTPS in 2012, being ordinary contributions only as the deficit payment due in December 2011 was paid early in March 2011.
The expected payments are reduced by 110m to recover overpayments of ordinary contributions paid in 2010 before the reduced rate of regular contributions was announced in February 2010.
Details of the measurement of scheme assets and liabilities, funding valuation and future funding obligations are disclosed in note 23 of the consolidated financial statements of British Telecommunications plc.

Derivatives continued Other derivatives At 31 March 2011, the company held certain foreign currency forward and interest rate swap contracts which were not in hedging relationships in accordance with FRS 26.
Foreign currency forward contracts were economically hedging operational purchases and sales.
The interest rate swap contracts were hedging the groups bond portfolio but became ineffective on first adoption of FRS 26.
The volatility arising from these swaps is recognised through the profit and loss account but is limited due to a natural offset in their valuation movements.
The table below shows features of these derivatives at 31 March 2011 and 2010.

The carrying amount of the short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the investments held.
The carrying amount of trade receivables and payables approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the amounts receivable and payable.
The fair value of the companys bonds, finance leases and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
The carrying value of oating rate borrowings approximated to their fair values due to the frequent reset of interest rates to market rates.
