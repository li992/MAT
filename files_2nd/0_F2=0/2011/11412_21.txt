in practice the Ocado Cell receives newly reported claims after the end of the underwriting period that have to be allocated to the year of loss i. e. the underwriting year of occurrence.
the calculation of this provision involves estimating a number of variables, principally the level of claims which may be received and the level of any compensation which may be payable.
uncertainty associated with these factors may result in the ultimate liability being different from the reported provision.
although it is expected that most claims will be settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date, the exact timing of utilisation of the provision is uncertain.
Dilapidations the dilapidations provision is based on the future expected repair costs required to restore the groups leased buildings and vans to their fair condition at the end of their respective lease terms.
the CfC1 lease expires in 2032, with leases for the spokes expiring between 2014 and 2021.
Contractual amounts are due to be incurred at the end of the respective lease terms.
leases for vans run for five years, with the contractual amount per van due at the end of the five year lease term.
if a noncontractual option to extend individual leases for a further six months is exercised by the group, the contractual obligation remains the same but is deferred by six months.

no collateral is held as security against these assets.
the groups only available-for-sale financial asset consists of an unlisted equity investment of which the fair value cannot Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investment be reliably determined, and which is therefore measured at the groups exposure to credit risk on cash and cash cost.
there has been no movement in this investment during equivalents and the short-term investment is managed by the period.
investing in banks and financial institutions with strong credit ratings and by regular review of counterparty risk in light of the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, the short-term the current economic climate.
the groups guideline is to investment, receivables, payables and accruals and borrowings maintain transactional bank accounts and term deposits with of a maturity of less than one financial period are assumed to financial institutions which carry a moodys rating of aa3 p1 approximate to their carrying values but for completeness are for long-term and short-term deposits.
the interest rate used to discount borrowings is based on a libOr plus margin measure blended for the type of security offered and was calculated as 5% 2010: 5%.
2 Credit risk continued Trade and other receivables trade and other receivables at the period end comprise mainly monies due from suppliers, which are considered of a good credit quality.
the group provides for doubtful receivables in respect of monies due from suppliers.
the group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity and the groups effective controls over this area.
the group has provided for doubtful receivables in respect of consumer sales by reviewing the ageing profile and, based on prior experience, assessing the recoverability of overdue balances.
movements in the provision for the impairment of trade and other receivables are as follows: 27 November 28 november 2011 2010 notes 000 000 at the beginning of the period 234 189 increase in provision for impairment of receivables 251 304 uncollectible amounts written off 215 217 recovery of amounts previously provided 42 At the end of the period 3.4.
3 Liquidity risk to manage the working capital needs of the business, the group is reliant on being able to negotiate sufficient financing arrangements.
to achieve this, the group maintains a mixture of short and medium-term debt and lease finance arrangements that are designed to ensure it has sufficient available funds to finance its operations.
during the period the group cancelled its committed standby bank overdraft facility of 5 million and replaced it with a group composite account facility with the requirement that the aggregate of favourable cash balances offset adverse cash balances, with a limit of 5 million adverse balance on any one account within the group.
the group monitors its liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities at all times so that the group does not breach borrowing limits or covenants where applicable on any of its borrowing facilities.

4 Market risk Currency risk the group has foreign currency exposure in relation to its foreign currency trade payables and a portion of its cash and cash equivalents.
foreign currency trade payables arise principally on purchases of plant and equipment.
euro bank accounts are maintained in order to minimise the groups exposure to fluctuations in the euro relating to current and future purchases of plant and equipment.
forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to hedge future purchases of plant and equipment in euro.
the groups exposure to currency risk is based on the following amounts: 27 November 28 november 2011 2010 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents euro 507 5,318 trade payables at period end euro 768 1,254 derivative liability asset forward foreign exchange contracts euro 255 472 516 4,536 the table below shows the groups sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates on its euro-related financial instruments: 27 November 2011 28 november 2010 Increase Increase increase increase decrease in decrease in decrease in decrease in income equity income equity 000 000 000 000 10% appreciation of the euro 143 2,718 760 1,453 10% depreciation of the euro 130 2,471 734 1,324 a strengthening of the euro, as indicated, against sterling at 27 november 2011 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts detailed above.
this analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the period.
the analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
4 Market risk continued Interest rate risk the group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate interest bearing borrowings and floating rate cash and cash equivalents.
the groups interest rate risk policy seeks to minimise finance charges and volatility by structuring the interest rate profile into a diversified portfolio of fixed rate and floating rate financial assets and liabilities.
interest rate risk on significant floating rate interest bearing borrowings is managed using interest rate swaps.
at the balance sheet date the interest rate profile of the groups interest bearing financial instruments was: 27 November 28 november 2011 2010 000 000 Fixed rate instruments financial assets 41,737 79,628 financial liabilities 62,204 62,195 Variable rate instruments financial assets 50,366 75,011 financial liabilities 49,063 11,919 Sensitivity analysis an increase of 100 basis points 1.0% in interest rates at the balance sheet date will increase equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown below.
a rate of 100 basis points was deemed appropriate, considering the current short-term interest rate outlook.
this calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at that date.
this analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant and considers the effect on financial instruments with variable interest rates.

it is a share ownership scheme under which the participants and appleby trust Jersey limited, the ebt trustee, held at balance sheet date separate beneficial interests in 36,305,099 2010: 32,476,700 ordinary shares which represents 6.5% 2010: 5.9% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Participants awards are granted to the executive board and a select group of senior management.
in the prior period they acquired interests in 32,476,700 ordinary shares with an issue price of 1.50 per share, in accordance with the groups first JsOs scheme JsOs1.
in the current period, interests in a further 3,990,799 ordinary shares with an issue price of 1.70 were acquired by a select group of senior management excluding directors in accordance with the groups second JsOs scheme JsOs2.
Nature of interests interests take the form of a restricted interest in ordinary shares in the Company the interest.
an interest permits a participant to benefit from the increase if any in the value of a number of ordinary shares in the Company shares over specified threshold amounts.
in order to acquire an interest, a participant must enter into a joint share ownership agreement with the ebt trustee, under which the participant and the ebt trustee jointly acquire the shares and agree that when the shares are sold the participant has a right to receive a proportion of the sale proceeds insofar as the value of the shares exceeds the threshold amount.
for JsOs2, the price was in a range of 7.1% to 10.8%.
when an interest vests, the ebt trustee will transfer shares to the participant of equal value to the participants interest or the shares will be sold and the ebt trustee will account to the participant for the balance, i. e. the difference between the sale proceeds less expenses and the hurdle price.
1 Share options and other equity instruments continued Vesting conditions the vesting of the interests granted to participants is subject to a time vesting condition with one quarter of the interest in the shares vesting on the first anniversary of their acquisition, one quarter on the second anniversary, one quarter on the third anniversary and the final quarter on the fourth anniversary.
the fair value of the interests awarded under the JsOs was determined using the black-scholes Option pricing model.
as per ifrs 2 share-based payment, market based vesting conditions and the share price target conditions in the JsOs have been taken into account in establishing the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
Other non-market or performance related conditions were not taken into account in establishing the fair value of equity instruments granted: instead, these non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments included in the measurement of the transaction amount so that, ultimately the amount recognised for services received as consideration for the equity instruments granted is based on the number of equity instruments that will eventually vest.
in determining the fair value of the interests granted, the black-scholes Option pricing model was used with the following inputs: JsOs1 tranche 1 tranche 2 tranche 3 tranche 4 weighted average share price 1.35 1.35 1.35 1.35 weighted average exercise price 1.73 1.91 2.08 2.28 expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 weighted expected life years 0.91 1.91 2.91 3.91 risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% JsOs2 tranche 1 tranche 2 tranche 3 tranche 4 weighted average share price 1.70 1.70 1.70 1.70 weighted average exercise price 1.96 2.15 2.36 2.59 expected volatility 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 weighted expected life years 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 risk-free interest rate 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% 3.5% expected dividend yield 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% expected volatility was determined by comparing the Company to a basket of others of a similar size or which operate in a similar industry.
