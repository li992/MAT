No deferred tax liability has been recognised in respect of a further 41,607 million 2010: 51,783 million of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and joint ventures because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
