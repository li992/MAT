Intangible assets continued Licences are amortised over the period to which they relate, which is on average 16 years 2010: 16 years: 2009: 18 years.
Where a licence has an indefinite life, the licence is not amortised until such time as the remaining life of the associated platform is estimated to be 20 years, at which point amortisation commences over the remaining useful life of the licence.

Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from the business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2011 2010 2009 $m $m $m Flight Support: Signature Flight Support 422.1 402.2 404.4 ASIG 166.1 166.3 166.8 Aftermarket Services and Systems: Engine Repair and Overhaul 140.8 115.8 116.2 Legacy Support 69.1 67.2 67.2 APPH 8.5 10.0 10.0 806.6 761.5 764.6 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
The future estimated cash flows are adjusted to reflect the individual risk of the CGU.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts and our view of our ability to outperform them.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The key assumptions in constructing the 2012-14 plans were that: Signature, ASIG and ERO continue their gradual recovery in 2012 with further improvements thereafter reflecting anticipated market trends: after taking into account the impact of the acquisition, Legacy Support remains stable with modest revenue growth and operational improvements: and APPH will be relatively stable in 2012 with no further weakening in activity followed by a gradual recovery, commencing during 2013.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next three years.
Cash flow projections beyond three years are based on internal management forecasts over the long-term business cycle and assume a growth rate not exceeding gross domestic product for the respective countries.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 10.3% 2010: 10.3% and this approximates to the Groups weighted average cost of capital which is deemed applicable for all CGUs, given the similarity of riskprofiles.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables and investments.
The Groups policy on credit risk relating to cash and derivative financial instruments is discussed in note 17.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction of the cash flows.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.

These two facilities were replaced with a new $750 million multi-currency RCF dated 21 April 2011 with a split maturity of $250 million, which is due to expire in April 2014, and $500 million which is due to expire in April 2016.
In addition, the Group raised $300 million in senior loan notes in the US private placement market dated 18 May 2011 with maturities of seven, 10 and 12 years with coupon rates between 5.22% to 5.91%.
The private placement complements the $750 million RCF and the funds raised were used to repay drawings under the $750 million facility.
The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of fixed and floating rate debt.
The floating rate debt exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whilst the fixed rate US dollar private placement debt exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of fixed rate debt owing to changes in interest rates.
Interest rate risk is managed by the combination of fixed rate debt and interest rate swaps in accordance with preagreed policies and authority limits.
As at 31 December 2011 67% of the Groups borrowings are fixed at a weighted average interest rate of 4.51% for a weighted average period of 2 years.
Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
All bank loans and loan notes are unsecured.

Derivative financial instruments continued BBA Aviation plc in Respect of the Consolidated Financial risk factors Financial Statements Our activities expose us to a variety of financial risks: market risk including currency risk and interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Overall 78 Consolidated Income our risk management policies and procedures focus on the uncertainty of financial markets and seek to manage and minimise potential financial Statement risks through the use of derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not undertake speculative transactions for which there is no underlying 79 Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income financial exposure.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors of BBA Aviation plc.
80 Consolidated Balance Sheet This department identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close co-operation with our subsidiaries.
The treasury policies cover specific 81 Consolidated Cash Flow Statement areas such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and the investment of excess liquidity.
82 Consolidated Statement of These policies are outlined further as described on page 54.
Changes in Equity 83 Accounting Policies of Capital risk management theGroup The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 88 Notes to the Consolidated shareholders through the optimisation of the debt to equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash Financial Statements equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent comprising capital, reserves and retained earnings.
121 Independent Auditors Report to the Members The Groups policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated funding requirements.
These borrowings, together with cash generated from of BBA Aviation plc in the operations, are on-lent or contributed as equity to subsidiaries at market-based interest rates and on commercial terms and conditions.
Respect of the Parent Company Financial The Group is subject to two financial covenant requirements within its borrowing facilities: maximum net debt to underlying EBITDA of Statements 3.5times and minimum net interest cover of 3.0 times based on EBITDA.
The Group complied with these covenants during the year.
122 Company Balance Sheet 123 Accounting Policies of Market risk theCompany Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in 124 Notes to the Company foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group has well defined policies for the management of these risks which includes the Financial Statements use of derivative financial instruments.
129 Principal Subsidiary Undertakings 130 Five Year Summary i Foreign exchange risk 131 Shareholder Information The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues, cash flows, assets and liabilities are mainly denominated in the currency in which the operations are located.
The Groups policy in relation to foreign exchange translation risk is not to hedge the income statement since such hedges only have a temporary effect.
In relation to the balance sheet, the Group seeks to denominate the currency of its borrowings in US dollars in order to match the currency of its cash flows, earnings and assets which are principally denominated in US dollars.
As at 31 December 2011 the majority of the Groups net borrowings were denominated in US dollars as detailed in the table below: 2011 US dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 90.0 12.9 19.6 2.6 125.1 Borrowings and finance leases 533.8 1.8 10.6 1.6 547.8 Derivative asset fair value of interest rate swaps on fixed interest rate borrowings 19.1 19.1 Net debt 424.7 11.1 9.0 1.0 403.6 2010 US Dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 99.7 22.0 44.6 2.8 169.1 Borrowings and finance leases 618.7 4.6 35.0 3.6 661.9 Net debt 519.0 17.4 9.6 0.8 492.8 2009 US Dollar Euros Sterling Other Total $m $m $m $m $m Cash and cash equivalents 107.5 18.7 57.2 2.4 185.8 Borrowings and finance leases 758.3 4.7 48.8 4.5 816.3 Net debt 650.8 14.0 8.4 2.1 630.5 104 Consolidated Financial Statements 17.
Derivative financial instruments continued As detailed in note 16, the US dollar private placement loan notes included within borrowings and finance leases in the 2011 table above, have been accounted for at fair value through profit and loss as the fair value interest rate risk has been hedged from fixed to floating interest rates.
The Group includes the fair value gain on the interest rate swaps in relation to the loan notes within net debt so that the net effect is to show the $300 million US private placement at face value to reflect the fact that the liabilities will be in place until maturity.
At the end of 2011 the Group had outstanding $200 million 2010: $400 million: 2009: $400 million and 50 million 2010: 50 million: 2009: 50 million of cross-currency swaps.
The fair value of currency derivatives that are designated and effective as net investment hedges at the 2011 year end amounting to a payable of $41.5 million 2010: payable $87.8 million: 2009: payable $76.8 million has been deferred in equity.
The Group manages its transactional foreign currency risk by hedging significant currency exposures in accordance with foreign exchange policies that our subsidiaries have in place which have been pre-agreed between Group Treasury and the subsidiary.
Each foreign exchange policy is individually tailored to the foreign exchange exposures within the relevant subsidiary.
Transaction currency risk is managed through the use of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
All committed exposures are fully hedged 100% and where significant foreign currency exposures exist then we generally will also cover a percentage of the projected foreign currency flows depending on the certainty of these cash flows.
The transaction foreign exchange risk is measured by each subsidiary submitting monthly reports to Group Treasury which detail the foreign currency exposure reported on the balance sheet as committed exposures and, for those subsidiaries with significant foreign exchange transaction exposures, an additional report detailing the future projected foreign currency cash flows over the life of the policy.
The predetermined policy margin is shown against the projected exposures to determine whether there is a net exposure which needs to be hedged.
If this is the case, then foreign exchange spot or forward contract s will be undertaken by Group Treasury on behalf of the relevant subsidiary with our relationship banks.

A loss of $2.4 million 2010: loss $5.6 million: 2009: loss $8.9 million has been transferred to the income statement in respect of contracts that matured during the period.
Foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as cash flow hedges are used to hedge foreign currency flows through the BBA Aviation plc company bank accounts and to ensure that the Group is not exposed to foreign exchange risk through the management of its international cash pooling structure.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts which have not been designated as cash flow hedges amounting to $1.1 million 2010: $2.0 million: 2009: $27.8 million have been transferred to administrative expenses in the income statement in the year.
The net impact on the Groups result for the period is immaterial, since the balances which these contracts relate to have had a similar but opposite effect on administrative expenses.
ii Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings are funded through a combination of bank debt and capital markets borrowings.
The Groups bank debt is funded through floating rate debt which exposes the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Groups capital markets borrowings are financed through US private placement fixed rate debt which exposes the Group to changes in the fair value of the fixed rate debt due to changes in interest rates.
During the year the Board reviewed and updated the Groups interest rate risk policy addressing the portion of its debt obligations, which should be fixed through the use of fixed rate debt and or interest rate swaps, in order to protect the interest cover covenant.

A charge of $6.2 million 2010: charge $10.4 million: 2009: charge $12.0m has been booked against hedged interest payments made in the period.
The Group has designated $300 million interest rate swaps as fair value hedges and the fair value gain of $19.1 million 2010: $nil: 2009: $nil has been booked to the income statement.
This amount is off-set against the change in fair value on the fixed rate debt, which has also been booked to the income statement, so that the net impact is immaterial.
Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
As part of the Groups operations, cash management and risk management activities the Group is exposed to counterparty risk arising on the financial assets that we have and the credit risk on outstanding derivative financial instruments.
Treasury related credit risk The Group aims to reduce counterparty risk by dealing with counterparties with investment grade ratings, as measured by financial credit rating agencies.
All Treasury related activity is concentrated with relationship banks that provide unsecured committed facilities to the Group.
Across the subsidiaries, wherever possible and where services can be provided efficiently and cost effectively, bank accounts, surplus cash and any hedging activity are concentrated and undertaken with relationship banks.
Each counterparty that the Group uses for derivatives, bank account activity and the investment of surplus cash is assigned a maximum credit limit dependent upon the counterpartys credit rating.
This limit gives a maximum permitted amount of cash and derivatives that can be held or undertaken with each counterparty.
Deposits are generally for short-term maturity of less than three months.
As at 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009, the Group had a number of exposures to individual counterparties.
These exposures are continually monitored and reported and no individual exposure is considered significant in the ordinary course of treasury management activity.
We do not expect any significant losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
Commercial related credit risk The Groups exposure to commercial related credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and finance lease receivables and the amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Sales to customers are settled by a number of different ways including cash, credit cards, cheques and electronic payment methods.
A customer or potential customer is assessed on a case-by-case basis to determine whether credit terms will be provided.
The Group does not expect any significant losses of receivables that have not been provided for as shown in note 12.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity requirements through the use of short-term and long-term cash flow forecasts.
In addition to strong cash generation in the businesses the Group maintains unsecured committed borrowing facilities from a range of banks to mitigate this risk further.

The following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the derivative portfolio and the proportion of derivatives hedging foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk are all constant and on the basis of hedge designations in place at 31 December 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at these dates and is not representative of the year then ended.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates relates only to cash flow interest rate derivatives.
Cash and floating rate debt balances are carried at amortised cost and so their carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
Fixed rate debt is also carried at amortised cost unless fair value interest rate hedges are entered into and hedge accounting achieved whereby the fixed rate debt is fair valued through the income statement to offset the movement in fair value of the swaps: fair value interest rate swaps are assumed to be fully effective and therefore there is no impact on the income statement or balance sheet from changes in interest rates: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges or net investment hedges are assumed to be recorded fully in equity: the sensitivity of accrued interest to movements in interest rates is calculated on net floating rate exposures on debt, cash and derivative instruments: 108 Consolidated Financial Statements 17.
Derivative financial instruments continued changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships only affect the income statement: all other changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are fully effective with no impact on the income statement: the floating rate leg of any swap or any floating rate debt is treated as not having any interest rate already set, therefore a change in the interest rates affects a full 12-month period for the accrued interest portion of the sensitivity calculations: the sensitivity of foreign exchange rates only looks at the outstanding foreign exchange forward book and the currency bank account balances at the Company only as at the balance sheet date and assumes this is the position for a full 12-month period: the sensitivity of a 10% movement in foreign exchange rates has been used due to the fact that historically rates can move by approximately 10% per annum: and the sensitivity of a 1% movement in interest rates has been used as over the last three years floating $ interest rates have moved by on average 1% per annum.
Using these assumptions the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, before the effects of tax.
2011 2010 2009 Income Income Income statement Equity statement Equity statement Equity $m $m $m $m $m $m $ FX rates strengthens 10% 28.2 33.4 43.3 $ FX rates weakens 10% 34.4 40.8 53.0 Euro FX rates strengthens 10% 6.3 16.6 7.1 Euro FX rates weakens 10% 7.7 20.4 8.7 Interest rates 1.00% 2.3 6.4 3.6 9.9 4.1 12.4 Interest rates 1.00% N A 6.5 N A 10.2 5.3 13.0 Due to underlying interest rates being low the sensitivity of the income statement to interest rates reducing by 1% is not relevant for 2011 and 2010.
The foreign exchange analysis in the sensitivity table above illustrates the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on foreign currency transactional exposures and does not include the impact on the translation of the Groups overseas income statement and balance sheet.
Thetranslation impact on profit before tax in the Groups income statement from the movement in exchange rates is approximately $0.2 million for each 1 movement in the $ exchange rate.

Pensions and other post-retirement benefits Report to the Members The Group operates a number of plans worldwide, of both the funded defined benefit type and the defined contribution type.
The normal of BBA Aviation plc in Respect of the Parent pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was $10.9 million 2010: $11.9 million of which $6.2 million 2010: $7.0 million was in Company Financial respect of foreign schemes.
This includes $7.8 million 2010: $7.3 million relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs are assessed Statements in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries.
122 Company Balance Sheet The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a final salary defined benefit scheme, the BBA Income and Protection 123 Accounting Policies of theCompany Plan IPP, with assets held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the plan was carried out as at 31 March 2009.
Following this valuation the Company 124 Notes to the Company Financial Statements agreed to pay additional contributions of 3.75 million $6.0 million per annum from 2011 to 2012 and 4.75 million $7.6 million in each of the 129 Principal Subsidiary years 2013 and 2014 to repair the funding shortfall of 30.8 million $48.0 million calculated at that date.
During 2008, the Trustees of the UK Undertakings defined benefit plan purchased from Legal & General Group plc an annuity to match the liabilities associated with pensioner members.
Since the 130 Five Year Summary initial buy-in, further tranches of annuities have been purchased periodically in respect of new pensioner liabilities, although there have been 131 Shareholder Information no new tranches purchased during 2011.
The annuity is an investment of the UK plan, and all pension liabilities and responsibility for future pension payments remain with the plan.
The income from the annuity matches the payments to be made to the pensioner members it covers and removes mortality risk in relation to those members which are the subject of the annuity purchase.
The IPP was closed to new members in 2002.
On 1 March 2010, the future service benefits provided by this plan were changed from a final salary to a career average re-valued earnings CARE basis.
At the same time, benefits accrued in the IPP prior to 1 March 2010 were changed so that these now increase in line with inflation rather than future salary increases.
The Groups foreign pension schemes all in North America mainly relate to a funded defined benefit pension arrangement.
There is also a post retirement medical plan and a deferred compensation plan.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
In accordance with IAS 19, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2011.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Per annum % Discount rate 4.6 5.4 5.5 4.4 5.2 5.8 Rate of increase to pensionable salaries 3.3 3.7 3.9 4.0 4.0 4.0 Price inflation 2.8 3.2 3.4 2.3 2.2 2.2 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.7 3.1 3.2 For the UK plan, the mortality assumptions are based on the recent actual mortality experience of members within the plan and the assumptions also allow for future mortality improvements.
The life expectancy assumptions applying to the UK plan as at 31 December 2011 are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Male Female Male Female Male Female Life expectancy for a current 65 year old years 21.8 22.8 21.7 22.7 21.6 22.6 Life expectancy for a 65 year old in 15 years years 24.0 25.4 23.9 25.3 23.8 25.2 For the US post retirement medical plan, the immediate trend rate for medical benefits was 8.0% which is assumed to reduce by 0.5% per annum to 5.0% in 2018 onwards.
Any surplus in excess of this benefit is not recognised in the balance sheet.
2 In accordance with IAS 19 and IFRIC 14 a minimum funding liability arises where the statutory funding requirements are such that future contributions in respect of past service will result in an unrecognisable surplus in future.
The funding policy for the United Kingdom and majority of the North American schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
Included within other receivables in the balance sheet are $4.5 million 2010: $5.5 million of listed investments which are held in trust for the benefit of members of the deferred compensation plan in North America.
These amounts are not included within the assets shown in the table above as they are not controlled by the plan in question.
A 0.25% decrease increase in the assumed discount rate for the UK plan would increase decrease the net deficit before impact of IFRIC 14 and the minimum funding liability by approximately $12.0 million.
The sensitivity of the net deficit to a 0.25% decrease increase in the assumed rate of future price inflation would be broadly similar to a 0.25% increase decrease in the assumed discount rate.
United Kingdom North America 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Long-term expected return on assets % Equities 7.1 8.5 8.8 8.9 8.5 9.0 Government bonds 2.8 4.2 4.5 Corporate bonds 4.4 5.2 5.5 4.2 4.7 4.5 Property 7.1 8.5 8.8 Insurance policies 4.6 5.4 5.5 Other 3.0 4.1 5.7 2.3 2.8 3.3 The expected rates of return reflect the Groups best estimate of the investment returns net of tax and expenses that will be earned on each asset class over the long term.
The long-term rates of return on bonds and other investments are set in line with market yields available at the balance sheet date.
In the UK, the long-term rate of return on equities is derived from considering current risk free rates of return with the addition of a future risk premium.
The overall expected return on assets in the analysis of the income statement is based on weighted average returns using the above rates for each asset class, and taking into account the asset allocation in each plan.

Report to the Members of BBA Aviation plc in In June 2011, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19 revised.
The revised standard is effective for annual Respect of the Parent periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 with early adoption permitted.
IAS 19 revised must be applied retrospectively.
Company Financial Statements The most significant amendment to IAS 19 for the Group is the replacement of interest cost and expected return on plan assets by a finance cost component comprising the net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet which includes any 122 Company Balance Sheet additional liability under IFRIC 14.
This finance cost component is determined by applying the same discount rate used to measure the defined 123 Accounting Policies of theCompany benefit obligation to the net defined benefit liability or asset recognised in the balance sheet.
The difference between the actual return on plan 124 Notes to the Company assets and the return included in the finance cost component in the income statement will be presented in other comprehensive income.
The Financial Statements effect of this change is to increase the pension expense recognised in the income statement by the difference between the current expected 129 Principal Subsidiary return on plan assets and the return calculated by applying the discount rate and by the interest on the additional liability under IFRIC 14.
Undertakings Based on an initial estimate of the impact of this particular amendment on the 2011 consolidated financial statements, the change would 130 Five Year Summary decrease pre-tax profit, with no effect on the pension liability.
The effect on total operating expenses and pre-tax profit is expected to be in the 131 Shareholder Information region of $6.0 million.
The effect at the date of adoption will depend on market interest rates, rates of return and the actual mix of scheme assets at that time.
