34 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
"ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice ""UK GAAP"" and with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts"" ""SORP"" issued by the Association of Investment Companies ""AIC"", in January 2009. a Basis of accounting - The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of fixed asset investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted by HM Revenue and Customs."
b Income - Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Overseas dividends are stated gross of withholding tax.
UK dividends are stated at the amount actually receivable, which is net of the attaching tax credit.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is credited on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the dividend foregone is recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the dividend foregone is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Derivative income from dividends on long contracts for difference CFDs is included in Income and recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends - Special dividends are treated as a capital receipt or a revenue receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs - All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement with the exception of any performance fee which is charged wholly to the capital column, as it arises mainly from capital returns on the portfolio.
"Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest rate method and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard ""FRS"" 26 ""Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement""."
e Taxation - Irrecoverable overseas withholding tax suffered is recognised at the same time as the income to which it relates.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred taxation asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency - The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Company's share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
g Valuation of investments - The Company's business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Company's Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
"Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as ""at fair value through profit or loss""."
They are included initially, and subsequently measured, at fair value, which is measured as follows: Investments listed overseas are valued at bid prices, or last prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: and Unlisted investments, where there is not an active market, are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes transaction costs within losses gains on investments and has disclosed them in Note 9 on page 40.
Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2011 35 Notes to the Financial Statements h Derivative instruments - The Company repaid its loans during the year and has obtained equivalent exposure to European equities through the use of long CFDs.
The gearing level is monitored and reviewed by the Board.
CFDs are measured at fair value which is the difference between the settlement price of the contract and the fair value of the underlying shares in the contract calculated in accordance with policy 1 g. All gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in Gains losses on derivatives instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Income received from dividends on the long CFDs is included in 'Income' and the finance costs are included in 'Finance costs', in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
"i Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc - The Company holds an investment in Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc - Euro Fund the ""Fund""."
The Fund invests in low risk short term investments.
It distributes its income and accordingly the interest earned within the Fund is treated as income.
j Loans - Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
k Capital reserve - The following are accounted for in the capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments and derivative instruments: Changes in the fair value of the investments and derivative instruments held at the year end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fee chargeable to capital: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable profits that arise from changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the balance sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash.
"l Dividends - In accordance with FRS 21: ""Events after the Balance Sheet Date"" dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date."

It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MANAGEMENT OF RISK The general risk analysis undertaken by the Board and its overall policy approach to risk management are set out in the Business Review on pages 16 and 17.
This Note is incorporated in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 29 FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Derivative instruments which comprise long CFDs The risks identified by FRS 29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises other price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk, credit risk and derivative instruments risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have been extended during this accounting period to manage the risks associated with the long CFDs.
MARKET PRICE RISK Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Company's business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has a geared exposure to European equities through the use of long CFDs which incur funding costs and provide collateral in euros.
It is, therefore, exposed to financial risk as a result of any increases in euro interest rates.
At 31 December 2010, the Company had a 65,000,000 fixed rate, unsecured bank loan which was repaid on 15 December 2011.
It also had a 25,000,000 floating rate credit facility which expired on 15 December 2011.

Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and long CFDs Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the UK sterling value of investments, long CFDs, or other net assets priced in other currencies, by the use of derivative instruments.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to UK sterling on receipt.

Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
COUNTERPARTY RISK All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by an independent Credit Research and Analysis function.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored and reported frequently.
Margin on exchange-traded derivatives mitigates counterparty risk exposure in accordance with the terms outlined in market standard ISDA derivative legal contracts.
CREDIT RISK Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers which have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank, outstanding securities transactions and the CFDs at fair value.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RISK The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments are included within the risk categories disclosed on pages 43 to 46.
Derivative instruments are used by the Manager to gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial outflow of capital.
The risk and performance contribution of these instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist derivative instruments team which draws on over forty years of specialist experience in derivative risk management.
This team uses sophisticated portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Manager on portfolio construction.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign currency risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 14 and 17 of the Directors Report.
An increase of 10% in the fair value of investments at 31 December 2011 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 50,441,000 2010: 69,355,000.
A decrease of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in long CFDs to gain exposure to the equity markets.
An increase of 10% in the price of shares underlying the CFDs at 31 December 2011 would have increased total net assets and total return on ordinary activities by 5,752,000 2010: nil.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2011, if interest rates had increased by 0.5% the total return on ordinary activities would have decreased by 210,000 2010: increase 128,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 0.5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
The sensitivity is based on the Companys cash balances held at 31 December 2011, including amounts held in Fidelity Institutional Liquidity Fund plc, and its exposure to long CFDs, with all other variables held constant.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis At 31 December 2011, if UK sterling had strengthened or weakened by 10% in relation to the larger currency exposures then, with all other variables held constant, total net assets and the total return on ordinary activities would have decreased increased by the amounts shown below.
If UK sterling had strengthened the impact would have been: 2011 2010 000 000 Danish krone 3,115 2,219 Euro 30,920 39,213 Swedish krona 3,187 4,658 Swiss franc 9,236 11,992 If UK sterling had weakened the impact would have been: 2011 2010 000 000 Danish krone 3,807 2,712 Euro 37,791 47,927 Swedish krona 3,895 5,693 Swiss franc 11,289 14,657 Fidelity European Values PLC Annual Report 2011 47 Notes to the Financial Statements 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES As explained in Note 1 g and h on pages 35 and 36 investments are stated at fair value, which is bid or last market price, and long CFDs are stated at fair value, which is the difference between the settlement price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract.
Other financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exception is the euro fixed rate unsecured loan that was held at 31 December 2010, whose fair value, given below, is calculated by discounting its future cash flows at the then current euro interest rate.
2011 2010 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 4.38% per annum 57,506 55,812 FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Under FRS 29, financial companies are required to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the Accounting Policies Note 1 g and h on pages 35 and 36.
All investments and derivative instruments held by the Company at 31 December 2011 are considered to fall within Level 1, with the exception of 3,109,000 2010: nil of long CFDs which fall within Level 2.
