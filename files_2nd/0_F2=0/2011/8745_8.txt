3 Bill 201011 received royal assent before the balance sheet date of 24 July 2011.
It included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 25%, with effect from 1 April 2012.
The lower rate of 25% has been used to determine the overall net deferred tax liability, as the temporary differences are expected to reverse at the lower rate.
The March 2011 budget announced a further 1% reduction in the main rate of corporation tax.
A lower rate of 26% from 1 April 2011 was enacted in July 2011, with the intention remaining for the rate to reduce further, by 1% per annum, to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further proposed rate reductions to 24% and 23% had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are, therefore, not included in the financial statements.
The proposed reductions in the rate are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The impact of the further changes in rate, from 25% to 23%, would be a 4.4 million increase in profits for the year.
The overall effect of the changes applied to the deferred tax balances at 24 July 2011 would be to increase profits for the year by 5.6 million being 2.8 million in July 2012 and 2.8 million in July 2013 and increase other comprehensive losses by 1.2 million being 0.6 million in July 2012 and 0.6 million in July 2013.
18 J D WETHERSPOON PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 7 Earnings and cash flow per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders, of 46,792,000 2010: 40,778,000, by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, of 132,019,936 2010: 134,902,108.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to exclude treasury shares held in respect of the employee Share Incentive Plan and the 2005 Deferred Bonus Scheme.
Earnings before exceptional items per share has been calculated before exceptional items detailed in note 3 and takes account of 23,250 2010: 59,032 potential dilutive shares under option, giving a weighted average number of ordinary shares, adjusted for the effect of dilution, of 132,043,186 2010: 134,961,140.
Adjusted earnings excludes an adjustment of 5,549,000 2010: 2,775,000, in respect of the corporation tax-rate change and exceptional items.

It is calculated before taking account of proceeds from property disposals, inflows and outflows of financing from outside sources and dividend payments and is based on the same number of shares in issue as that for the calculation of basic earnings per share.

In assessing whether an asset has been impaired, the carrying amount of the CGU is compared with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
In the absence of any information about the fair value of a CGU, the recoverable amount is deemed to be its value in use.
The company estimates value in use using a discounted cash flow model, based on the expected future trading performance anticipated by management.
There is a significant number of interconnected assumptions which underpins the value-in-use calculations.
However, the underlying basis for the impairment model involves each CGUs projected cash flow for the 52 weeks ending 22 July 2012, extrapolated to incorporate individual assumptions, in respect of sales growth, gross margin and cost-savings for that specific CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate employed by the company this year was 10% 2010: 10%.
The board approved the discount rate, considering it to be prudent, yet reflective of the current economic climate.
As a result of this exercise, an impairment loss of 4,410,000 2010: 10,557,000 was charged to operating costs in the income statement.
Of the previous years charge, 9,441,000 is reflected in the table above, while 1,117,000 relates to other non-current assets, as described in note 13.
Management believes that a reasonable change in any of the key assumptions, for example the discount rate applied to each CGU, could cause the carrying value of the CGU to exceed its recoverable amount, but that the change would be immaterial.

28 J D WETHERSPOON PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 20 Financial instruments continued Interest-rate swaps At 24 July 2011, the company had fixed-rate swaps designated as hedges of floating-rate borrowings.
The floating-rate borrowings are interest-bearing borrowings at rates based on LIBOR, fixed for periods of up to six months.
The interest-rate swaps of the floating-rate borrowings were assessed to be effective: a cumulative loss of 57,880,000 2010: a loss of 61,391,000, with a deferred tax credit of 14,470,000 2010: a credit of 16,570,000, relating to the hedging instrument, is included in equity.
A gain of 3,511,000 for the year 2010: loss of 25,395,000 is reflected in equity.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Effective from 27 July 2009, the company adopted the amendment to IFRS 7 for financial instruments which are measured in the balance sheet at fair value.
This requires disclosure of fair value measurements by level, using the following fair value measurement hierarchy: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1 Inputs other than quoted prices included in level 1 which are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly level 2 Inputs for the asset or liability which are not based on observable market data level 3 The fair value of the cash flow hedge of 57.9 million is considered to be level 2.
All other financial assets and liabilities are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost.
21 Other liabilities 2011 2010 000 000 Operating lease incentives and provisions 9,819 8,153 Amount held in respect of gaming machine settlement under appeal by HMRC 14,947 14,941 24,766 23,094 Included in other liabilities are lease incentives on leases where the lessor retains substantially all of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
The lease incentives are recognised as a reduction in rent paid over the lease term, resulting in deferred income recognised on the balance sheet.
The weighted average period to maturity of operating lease incentives is 16.1 years 2010: 16.3 years.
Also included is an amount held in respect of the companys gaming machine VAT claim.
A decision was released during the previous financial year in respect of Rank plcs gaming claim, and this latest ruling fell in the taxpayers favour.
As a result, the company was able to further pursue its own gaming claim which was submitted in January 2006.
HMRC made a repayment of the existing claim, subject to the company providing a guarantee to HMRC that, in the event that the existing decision be overturned in a higher court, the amount will be repayable in full.
HMRC lodged an appeal with the European Court of Justice in respect of Rank plcs decision and this was heard on 30 June 2011: a decision is expected by the end of the calendar year.
The company is holding the repayment amount of 14,947,000 as a liability, until the Rank plc case has reached its final conclusion.
