Financial risk management continued 26 e Interest rate risk continued ii Interest rate swaps During 2009 the Group entered into interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to interest rate risk on US Dollar 450m debt by swapping floating for fixed interest rates.
The profile of the interest rate swaps is as follows: Payable USD Notional weighted average Receivable USD value interest rate interest rate 2011 2011 2011 Maturity USD m % % March 2012 300 1.83 3 month USD LIBOR Payable USD Notional weighted average Receivable USD value interest rate interest rate 2010 2010 2010 Maturity USD m % % March 2011 150 1.60 3 month USD LIBOR March 2012 300 1.83 3 month USD LIBOR The swaps were designated as cash flow hedges and are highly effective.
The fair value gain of 2.9m has therefore been deferred within equity 2010: 1.5m loss.
iii Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below shows the exposure to interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative net financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.
A 100 basis point increase in interest rates with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a gain on profit after tax for the year to 31 December 2011 of 0.5m 2010: 0.7m gain.
26 f Price risk The Group is exposed to commodity price risk through its joint venture rail operations due to the volatility in the price of fuel.
The maturity profile of the commodity derivative used by the joint venture to reduce this risk is as follows: Notional Payable value fixed rate 2011 2011 Maturity Million litres p per litre January 2012 September 2013 64.6 44.81 Notional Payable value fixed rate 2010 2010 Maturity Million litres p per litre January 2011 September 2011 18.5 28.95 January 2011 September 2011 10.8 39.70 January 2011 September 2013 74.2 42.96 The commodity derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and is highly effective.
During the year a loss of 0.3m 2010: 1.0m gain has been deferred within equity.
iv Price risk sensitivity An increase of US Dollar 0.2 per litre in the price of fuel at the balance sheet date would result in a gain of 4.2m in equity 2010: 7.1m gain.
The sensitivity to changes in fuel prices resulting from changes in exchange rates is included within the currency sensitivity analysis see note 26 d. Serco Group plc | Annual report and accounts 2011 | 147 Financial statements Governance Our performance Our business Overview
