As at 31 January 2011, the Company had accumulated surplus expenses of 142.8 million 2010 133.3 million.
At 31 January 2011, the Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 38.5 million 2010 37.3 million in respect of the accumulated expenses.
Provided the Company continues to maintain its current investment profile, it is unlikely that these expenses will be utilised and that the Company will obtain any benefit from this asset.
The Company will continue to seek approval under Section 1158 of the Corporation Taxes Act 2010 for the current year and the foreseeable future.
The Company has not therefore provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposal of investments.
