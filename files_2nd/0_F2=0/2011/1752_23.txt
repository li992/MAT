Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Group financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The Company is a public limited company, is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and applied consistently throughout the year, are disclosed below: Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements comprise the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March.
a Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
If, however, more than 50% of the voting rights are owned but the Group does not govern the financial and operating policies then this investment is not consolidated as a subsidiary.
Acquisitions are included from the date of acquisition and the results of the businesses disposed of or terminated are included in the results for the year up to the date of relinquishing control or closure and analysed as continuing or discontinued operations.
b Joint ventures The Groups interests in jointly controlled entities are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recorded at cost.
The Groups investment in jointly controlled entities includes goodwill net of any accumulated impairment loss identified on acquisition.
The Groups share of its jointly controlled entities post-acquisition profits or losses after tax is recognised in the income statement, and its share of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in reserves.
The cumulative post-acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment.
Unrealised gains and losses on transactions between the Group and its jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the joint controlled entities.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
The following specific recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: a Sale of goods Revenue is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer and can be reliably measured and recovery of consideration is considered probable.
b Sale of services Revenue from services rendered is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the transaction.
The provision of services over a long-term period are accounted for under the principles of construction contracts, and the revenue recognised as set out below.
c Long-term service contracts Revenue from long-term service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is determined according to the nature of the specific contract concerned.
Methods used to assess the stage of completion include incurred costs as a proportion of total costs, labour hours incurred or earned value of work performed.
Profit attributable to the contract activity is recognised if the final outcome of such contracts can be reliably assessed.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
86 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Business review Governance Group accounts Company accounts 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Exceptional items Items that are exceptional in size or nature are presented as exceptional items within the consolidated income statement.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a better indication of the Groups underlying business performance.
Events which may give rise to the classification of items as exceptional include gains or losses on the disposal of properties and businesses along with the restructuring of businesses and asset impairments.
Transactions with non-controlling interests The Group policy is to treat transactions with non-controlling interest as transactions with equity holders and therefore result in movements in reserves.
Goodwill and intangible assets a Goodwill When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking exceeds the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and is capitalised.
When the fair value of the consideration for an acquired undertaking is less than the fair value of its separable net assets, the difference is taken directly to the income statement.
Goodwill relating to acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 is maintained at its net book value on the date of transition to IFRS.
From that date goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed at least annually for impairment.
b Acquired intangibles Intangible assets, which are capable of being recognised separately and measured reliably on acquisition of a business, are capitalised at fair value on acquisition.
These intangibles will include contracts and customer relationships.
Where these assets have a finite life, they are amortised over the period in which they are expected to generate benefits, but generally not exceeding ten years.
Customer contracts and relationships valued on acquisition are expected to generate higher benefits in the early years following such acquisition as the existing contracts unwind.
c Research and development Research expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and only if the cost can be measured reliably.
Other development expenditure is recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Development costs that have been capitalised are amortised from the date the product is available for use on a straight-line basis over the period of its expected benefit but not exceeding seven years.
d Computer software Computer software is shown at cost less amortisation and is amortised over its expected useful lives of between three and five years.
Property, Plant and Equipment PPE Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land, which is shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of PPE over the estimated useful lives to their estimated residual value reassessed at each balance sheet date at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% to 8% Leasehold property lease term Plant and equipment 6.6% to 33.3% PPE is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
An assets carrying amount is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount exceeds the higher of an assets fair value less cost to sell or value in use.
Net debt Net debt consists of the total of loans, bank overdrafts, cash and cash equivalents and finance leases plus any derivatives, which in part swap the currency of the debt into the functional currency of the Group.
87 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Leases Assets under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding capital element of instalments is included in borrowings.
The interest element is charged against profits so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Depreciation is calculated to write the assets off over their expected useful lives or over the lease terms where these are shorter.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis.
A provision is made where the operating leases are deemed to be onerous.
Inventory and work in progress Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined on a first-in first-out method.
In the case of finished goods and work in progress, cost comprises direct material and labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Contract accounting The Group presents as an asset the gross amount due from customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings.
The Group presents as a liability the gross amount due to customers for contract work for all contracts in progress for which progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses.
Pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset and amortised over the life of the contract when it can be reliably expected that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
Taxation a Current income tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
b Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Foreign currencies a Functional and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the local currency at the year end exchange rates.
88 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Business review Governance Group accounts Company accounts 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement except when deferred in equity as part of the net investment of a foreign operation.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the balance sheets and income statements of foreign operations into Sterling are recognised as a separate component of equity on consolidation.
Results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated using the average exchange rate for the month of the applicable results.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at period end exchange rates.
Finance costs Finance costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred unless they are attributable to an asset under construction, in which case finance costs are capitalised.
Capitalisation of applicable interest commenced in 2009 10.
Employee benefits a Pension obligations The Group operates a number of pension schemes.
The schemes are generally funded through payments to trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations.
The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
For defined benefit pension schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit actuarial valuation method.
The Groups current and past service cost and imputed interest on the defined benefit schemes obligations, net of the expected return on the schemes assets, are charged to operating profit within the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity through the Statement of comprehensive income so that the Groups balance sheet reflects the fair value of the schemes surpluses or deficits at the balance sheet date.
b Share-based compensation The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
The economic cost of awarding shares and share options to employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement equivalent to the fair value of the benefit awarded.
The fair value is determined by reference to option pricing models.
The charge is recognised in the income statement over the vesting period of the award.
The shares purchased by the Groups ESOP trusts are recognised as a deduction to equity.
c Holiday pay Paid holidays are regarded as an employee benefit and as such are charged to the income statement as the benefits are earned.
Investments The accounting for investments is decided on a case by case basis depending on whether the investment is held for resale or other strategic reasons.
Service concession arrangements IFRIC 12 Service concession arrangements addresses the accounting by private sector operators involved in the provision of public sector infrastructure assets and services.
For all arrangements falling within the scope of the Interpretation essentially those where the infrastructure assets are not controlled by the operator, the infrastructure assets are not recognised as property, plant and equipment of the operator.
Rather, depending on the terms of the arrangement, the operator recognises: a financial asset where the operator has an unconditional right to receive a specified amount of cash or other financial asset over the life of the arrangement: or an intangible asset where the operators future cash flows are not specified e. g. where they will vary according to usage of the infrastructure asset : or both a financial asset and an intangible asset where the operators return is provided partially by a financial asset and partially by an intangible asset.
89 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 1.
Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued As a consequence of this treatment the operator recognises investment income in respect of the financial asset on an effective interest basis and amortisation of any intangible asset arising.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
The Group designates certain of the derivative instruments within its portfolio to be hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or unrecognised firm commitments.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
For derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are deferred in equity until such time as the firm commitment is recognised, at which point any deferred gain or loss is included in the assets carrying amount.
These gains or losses are then realised through the income statement as the asset is sold.
Certain derivatives do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments and any movement in their fair values is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups financial statements in the period in which they are approved.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The key areas of estimates and judgements for the Group are contract accounting see above, the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes see note 26, impairment of goodwill see note 12 and income tax recognition.
Profit recognition on contracts is a key judgement exercised by management on a contract by contract basis.
In order to make such a judgement an estimate of contract outturn is made and for all significant contracts both local management and Group review and challenge estimates made.
Fair value adjustments on acquisitions are by nature subject to critical judgements.
The size of recent acquisitions make them significant in Group terms.
Standards, amendments and interpretations to published standards Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published that are mandatory for the Groups accounting periods beginning on or after 1 April 2010 or later periods but which the Group has not early adopted.
IFRS 3 revised, Business combinations: as a consequence of which 12.8 million of acquisition costs are included in exceptional costs which would have previously been cost of investment and included in goodwill.

Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued b New standards and interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group.
The impact on the Groups operations is currently being assessed: IAS 24 amendment, Related party disclosures, effective 1 January 2011.
2010 Annual improvements, effective from 1 January 2011. c Interpretations to existing standards that are not yet effective and are not anticipated to be relevant for the Groups operations: IFRIC 19, Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments, effective 1 July 2010.
IFRIC 14, IAS 19 Prepayment of a minimum funding requirement, effective from 1 January 2011.
Financial risk management Financial risk management Financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the Group and the financing of those activities.
Interest rate risk is managed through the maintenance of a mixture of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps, each being reviewed on a regular basis to ensure the appropriate mix is maintained.
The Group has two main areas of currency exposure: firstly, the US$650 US Private Placements which are swapped into Sterling and secondly, through its activities in South Africa and the USA where both translational and transactional exposure exist.
It is Group policy not to cover the effects of exchange rate fluctuation on translation of the results of foreign subsidiaries into the Groups functional currency, Sterling.
All material transactional exposures arising through trading in currencies other than the operations functional currency must be eliminated by the use of forward cover contracts as soon as they are known of.
All treasury transactions are carried out only with prime rated counterparties as are investments of cash and cash equivalents.
The Groups customers are mainly from government, government backed institutions or blue chip corporations and as such credit risk is considered small.
Management of capital A range of gearing and liquidity ratios are used to monitor and measure capital structure and performance, including: Net debt to EBITDA defined as net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, Gearing ratio defined as net debt, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, divided by shareholders funds, ROIC defined as net income divided by total capital equity, excluding retirement benefit deficits or surpluses, plus net debt and EBITDA interest cover defined as profit before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and exceptionals divided by net interest payable.
Foreign exchange risk The foreign exchange exposure of Group entities on the net monetary position against their respective functional currencies expressed in the Groups presentation currency is insignificant with the largest exposure being 6.4 million 2010: Sterling to Euro 1.1 million.
Consequently, the pre tax effect on profit and equity, increase or decrease, if the rates moved up or down by an appropriate percentage volatility, assuming all other variables remained constant would in total be 1.0 million 2010: 0.1 million.
The reasonable shifts in exchange rates are based on historic volatility and range from 10% for Sterling to Euro to 15% for South African Rand to Euro and 10% Sterling to US Dollars.
91 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2.
Financial risk management continued Interest rate risk The fair values of debt, and related hedging instruments are affected by movements in interest rates.
The following table illustrates the sensitivity in cash flow of interest rate-sensitive instruments to a hypothetical parallel shift of the forward interest rate curves of 50bp 2010: 50bp, with pre tax effect from the beginning of the year.
All other variables are held constant.

Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying businesses, Group treasury maintains flexibility in funding by maintaining availability under committed credit lines.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax asset 62.6 91.3 Deferred tax liability 85.8 9.0 23.2 82.3 Deferred tax expected to be recovered within 12 months: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax asset 2.6 Deferred tax liability 22.4 5.0 22.4 2.4 104 Babcock International Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Business review Governance Group accounts Company accounts 16.
Deferred tax continued At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses excluding UK capital losses and advance corporation tax of 42.8 million 2010: 52.7 million available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 13.4 million 2010: 7.5 million of such losses, which may be carried forward.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the remaining 29.4 million 2010: 45.2 million due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 109.0 million 2010: 129.0 million.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed in note 9, a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The effect of the changes expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2011 would be to reduce the deferred tax liability provided at the balance sheet date by 762,000.
This 762,000 decrease in the deferred tax liability would decrease profit by 3,292,000 and decrease equity by 2,530,000.
This decrease in deferred tax liability is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 25% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to further reduce the deferred tax liability by an additional 1,524,000 being 762,000 recognised in 2013 and 762,000 recognised in 2014.

As of 31 March 2011, trade receivables of 9.9 million 2010: 4.2 million were impaired.
Impairment arises in the main, through contract disputes rather than credit defaults.
The amount of the provision was 9.9 million 2010: 4.2 million.
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to receivables in the International division.
It was assessed that a portion of these receivables is expected to be recovered.

Amounts charged to the impairment provision are generally written off when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivables mentioned above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security other than retention of title clauses issued as part of the ordinary course of business.

The Trusts enable shares in the Company to be held or purchased and made available to employees through the grant and exercise of rights or awards under the Companys employee share schemes.
The Trusts are discretionary settlements for the benefit of employees within the Group.
The Company is excluded from benefiting under them.
They are controlled and managed outside the UK and each has a single corporate trustee which is an independent trustee services organisation.
The right to remove and appoint the trustees rests ultimately with the Company.
The trustee of the Babcock Employee Share Trust is required to waive both voting rights and dividends payable on any share in the Company in excess of 0.001p, unless otherwise directed by the Company, but the trustee of the Peterhouse Employee Share Trust does not have the power to waive dividends due on Babcock ordinary shares and therefore receives the full amount of any dividends declared.
