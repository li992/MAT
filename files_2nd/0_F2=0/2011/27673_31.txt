Business overview Business review Risk and responsibility Governance Financial statements Shareholder information FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the year ended 31 December 2011 1 Financial assets and liabilities Company statement of financial position The Company is principally involved in the management of its investments in subsidiaries, with its risks considered to be consistent with those in the operations themselves.
Full details of the financial risks are provided in the consolidated financial statements, notes E1 and E2.
The most important components of financial risk for the Company are interest rate risk, currency risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
These risks arise from open positions in interest rate, currency and equity products, all of which are exposed to general and specific market movements.
a Categories of financial instruments The financial instruments of the Company consist of derivative assets and liabilities, both of which are treated as held-for-trading, other assets and cash and cash equivalents which are treated as loans and receivables, borrowed funds of which 637 million is designated as fair value through the income statement and 503 million at amortised cost 2010: 905 million and 546 million respectively and other liabilities which are also measured at amortised cost.
Of the financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value through the income statement, the hierarchy classification as detailed in note E1 b of the Group accounts of derivative assets and liabilities is Level 2 and borrowed funds Level 1. b Capital risk management Old Mutual plc is the holding company of the Group and is responsible for the raising and allocation of capital in line with the Groups capital management policies set out in note E1 to the consolidated financial statements and for ensuring the operational funding and regulatory capital needs of the holding company and its subsidiaries are met at all times.
c Currency risk The Company is exposed to effects of fluctuations in the prevailing foreign currency exchange rates on its financial position and cash flows through the impact that currency movements have on its derivative position and the investment in  Skandia publ classed as held for sale.
The principal foreign currency risk arises from the fact that the Companys functional currency is pounds sterling, whereas the functional currency of its principal operations is South African rand, US dollar, Swedish krona and euro.
The exposure of the Group to currency risk is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, note E1 e. The Company hedges some of this currency translation risk through currency swaps, currency borrowings and forward foreign exchange rate contracts.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward exchange contracts and currency swap agreements.
A 10% deterioration in the values of the major currencies the Company is exposed to in relation to pounds sterling would result in a decrease in the Companys equity holders funds of 297 million 2010: decrease of 17 million.
d Credit risk The Company is principally exposed to credit risk through its derivative asset positions, holdings of cash and cash equivalents and the ability of its subsidiaries to repay amounts due to the Company, which it holds to back shareholder liabilities.
The exposure of the Group to credit risk is disclosed in the consolidated financial statements, note E2.
Credit risk is managed by placing limits on exposures to any single counterparty, or groups of counterparties and to geographical and industry segments.
Credit risk is monitored with reference to established credit rating agencies with limits placed on exposure to below investment grade holdings or the financial position of companies within the Group.
Of the Companys financial assets bearing credit risk, derivative assets and cash and cash equivalents are rated as investment grade being AAA to BBB for Standard & Poors or an equivalent.
The other financial assets bearing credit risk are not rated.
e Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that fluctuating interest rates will unfavourably affect the Companys earnings and the value of its assets, liabilities and capital.
The Company employs currency and interest rate swap transactions to mitigate against the impact of changes in the fair values of its borrowed funds.
Details of the arrangements in place are shown in the Group Accounts note E7 Hedge accounting.
f Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that cash may not be available to pay obligations when due at a reasonable cost.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Companys short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Company has net current liabilities of 1,582 million 2010: 994 million, all of which represent liabilities to other Group companies.
The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows of both the Company and its subsidiaries.
The key information reviewed by the Companys executive directors and Executive Committee, together with the Capital Management Committee, is a detailed management report on the Companys current and planned capital and liquidity position.
Forecasts are updated regularly based on when new information is received, and as part of the annual business planning cycle.
The Companys liquidity and capital position and forecast are presented to the Companys Board of directors on a regular basis.

2 Derivative financial instruments The following tables provide a detailed breakdown of the derivative financial instruments outstanding at the year end.
These instruments allow the Company to transfer, modify or reduce foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
The Company undertakes transactions involving derivative financial instruments with other financial institutions.
Management has established limits commensurate with the credit quality of the institutions with whom it deals, and manages the resulting exposures such that a default by any individual counterparty is unlikely to have a materially adverse impact on the Company.
