Pension schemes The company operates a group personal pension plan in the UK together with a funded, registered, defined benefit pension scheme, the Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme which was closed to new members in 1997.
The Scheme provides a pension on broadly a fiftieths accrual basis of up to two-thirds salary at the normal pension age of 60.
Benefits are actuarially reduced on early retirement before age 60 and pensions in payment increase in line with the lower of inflation, or 5 per cent per annum.
The company has operated its own cap on pensionable earnings since April 2006, when the external cap was removed.
In the Scheme, the cap is determined at 1 January each year and, for the year to 31 December 2011, this was set at 123,600, and will increase to 129,600 for the year to 31 December 2012.
The company has agreed to provide Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan, A R C Durrant, N Hawkings and A G Lodge with a pension substantially as if they were contributing members of the Scheme and, in regard to service completed subsequent to their appointment as directors, not subject to the cap.
The value of this target pension provision is made available at each directors option in the form of an enhanced level of pension contributions and or a non-pensionable salary supplement.
Regular reviews are carried out to assess the extent to which the payments already made to each director are projected to be sufficient to provide the accrued component of their target pension: where such reviews indicate a shortfall, the company provides an additional, non-pensionable target funding payment.
In respect of 2011, Mr A R C Durrant elected to receive a salary supplement, Mr A G Lodge elected to receive pension contributions whilst Messrs S C Lockett, R A Allan and N Hawkings elected for a combination of the two.
Messrs R A Allan, N Hawkings and A G Lodge are members of the companys group personal pension plan whilst Mr S C Lockett is a member of the Scheme and also has a personal pension policy.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 75 Pension schemes continued The payments by the company in respect of pension benefits are summarised below: Target Salary Pension funding supplements contributions payments Total 000 000 000 000 1 S C Lockett 59.7 38.4 43.9 142.0 R A Allan 7.9 54.5 39.5 101.9 A R C Durrant 59.9 57.8 117.7 N Hawkings 40.9 17.0 17.4 75.3 A G Lodge 60.7 36.2 96.9 Note: 1 The companys pension contribution for Mr S C Lockett comprises a payment of 7,497 made to his personal pension policy and 30,900 made to the Scheme in respect of his membership thereof.
The accrued pension entitlements of the directors who were members or deemed members of the Scheme during 2011 are as follows: b d e g a Transfer value c Transfer value Increase from f Increase Accrued in respect Accrued in respect d to b less Transfer value in accrued pension as at of a as at pension as at of c as at contributions of increase pension 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December by director in accrued excluding 2011 2011 2010 2010 during 2011 benefit inflation 000 pa 000 000 pa 000 000 000 000 S C Lockett 92.4 1,342.9 78.1 1,041.1 273.1 144.2 11.9 R A Allan 45.8 802.5 38.9 626.2 159.0 82.6 5.7 A R C Durrant 40.2 731.7 32.2 534.7 177.9 108.3 7.0 N Hawkings 32.9 550.8 25.6 393.5 140.0 91.5 6.5 A G Lodge 14.8 292.9 9.0 162.4 113.2 91.5 5.5 Notes: The amounts of accrued pension under a and c represent the accrued pension entitlements of the director as at the stated dates.
The transfer values under b, d and f have been calculated in line with the Occupational Pension Schemes Transfer Values Amendment Regulations 2008 SI 2008 1050.
The increases under e are principally due to the additional pension accrued over the year.
The amounts under f represent the increase in value of the directors benefits in terms of the value, on the transfer value basis in force at the end of the year, of the excess of the end-year accrued benefits over the start-year accrued benefits as revalued by price inflation less contributions by the directors.
The values stated above correspond with the target level of final salary pension provision: in practice, the pension benefits for these directors are principally established through individual money purchase arrangements and salary supplements.
In addition to the current provision noted above, Mr R A Allan is entitled to a deferred pension under the Scheme in respect of a prior service period with the company between September 1986 and November 1999.
Members of the Scheme have the option to pay additional voluntary contributions: none of the directors have elected to do so.
Some of the shares were sold to pay income tax and National Insurance contributions payable by Messrs S C Lockett, A R C Durrant and A G Lodge upon the accelerated vesting of the awards, but the amounts received from the sale remain subject to clawback in the event of the participant leaving Premier other than as a good leaver.
In the case of Mr R A Allan, who as an expatriate is not subject to UK tax, a percentage of the shares were withheld equal to the percentage tax rate that would have applied had he been subject to UK income tax.
These shares reverted to the Employee Benefit Trust and the company will pay any overseas duties payable by Mr Allan as a result of the vesting of his shares, but the amount paid remains subject to clawback if Mr Allan leaves Premier other than as a good leaver.
The remaining shares are held in a nominee account within the Employee Benefit Trust until the end of the original deferral period, and are forfeitable if the director leaves other than as a good leaver.

The terminal valuation was averaged over the three-month period from 1 October 2011 to 31 December 2011.
Over the performance period, the companys market value increased from 871 million to 1,703 million, equivalent to growth of 29.6 per cent per annum, generating an aggregate LTIP Equity Pool valued at 20.8 million.
The Committee considered the long-term underlying improvement in the performance of the company and were satisfied that the LTIP performance was reflective of the performance of the company for the same period.
As a result, the Equity Pool vested in January 2012, and 20.8 million will be distributed between all LTIP participants, with 50 per cent released in shares and 50 per cent in deferred shares.

50 per cent of the vested shares were released in January 2012 with the remaining 50 per cent deferred.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 79 Outstanding awards under previous long-term incentive arrangements Asset and Equity Plan AEP The AEP preceded the LTIP as the companys main long-term incentive and expired in 2009.
The AEP has two elements: the Asset Pool and the Equity Pool.
The value of the Asset Pool is based on the increase in the net asset value per share of the company over a three-year period and the value of the Equity Pool is based on the increase in equity value per share of the company over a three-year period.
In both cases, no pool is created for growth in asset value or share price of less than 10 per cent per annum.
At growth of 10 per cent per annum, the pools are funded by 1 per cent of the growth.
The funding of the pools is capped at 2.5 per cent of the growth at growth of 20 per cent per annum.
The funding rate of the pools increases on a straightline basis between these two points.
In addition, the vesting of awards is subject to the Committee being satisfied that there has been satisfactory improvement in the performance of the company.
The pools are allocated to eligible employees based on their pro rata entitlement.
50 per cent of vested AEP awards are released in shares at the end of the performance period.
The remaining 50 per cent is deferred in shares over three years and are eligible for a Matching Award which vests subject to the companys three-year TSR relative to a comparator group of oil and gas companies i. e. on the same basis as LTIP Matching Awards.
The last AEP award the 2008 cycle covered the three-year performance period 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2010.
