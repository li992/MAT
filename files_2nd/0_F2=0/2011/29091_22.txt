Asset Management principally comprises investment management including advisory services, equity products, fixed income securities, multi-asset and alternative asset classes such as property, commodities, private equity and funds of hedge funds.
Private Banking principally comprises investment management and banking services provided to high net worth individuals and charities.
Group principally comprises the Groups investment capital and treasury management activities and the management of costs associated with governance and corporate management.
Segment information is presented on the same basis as that provided for internal reporting purposes to the Groups chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker is the Chief Executive.
One of the key measures used in respect of performance measurement is net revenue.
The allocation of costs to individual business segments is undertaken in order to provide management information on the business performance and to provide managers with a tool to manage and control expenditure.
Costs are allocated on a basis that aligns the charge with the resources employed in a particular area of the business.

indd 93 13 03 2012 16:59 94 Financial report Notes to the accounts 2 Revenue Fee income is the Groups primary source of revenue.
This mainly represents income from the Groups investment management activities within both Asset Management and Private Banking.
The fees are generally based on an agreed percentage of the valuation of the assets under management.
Performance fees are earned from some clients when contractually agreed performance levels are exceeded within specified performance measurement periods.
Revenue also includes some transaction-based fees which vary based on the volume of transactions.
Management fees are the total charge to our clients and include fees that are paid away to intermediaries.
Such fee expenses are quantified and explained innote 3.
Private Banking entities receive interest as a result of placing loans with other financial institutions, advancing loans and overdrafts to customers and holding debt and other fixed income securities.
For Private Banking, earning a net interest margin is a core activity: interest income is therefore recorded separately from interest earned elsewhere in the business.
Fee income is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the income can be reliably measured.
Fees comprising management fees, commitment fees, arrangement fees, guarantor fees, Directors fees, and other fees which are principally administrative in nature, are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Fees received in advance of the service provided are taken to the statement of financial position and amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of the provision of the asset management service.
The period of provision of service is estimated based on experience in the separate geographical locations where such fees are earned.
Redemptions are reviewed on an annual basis and the amortisation rate adjusted where there has been a significant and lasting change in redemption levels.
The Group is entitled to earn performance fees from a number of clients where the performance of the clients assets exceeds defined benchmarks by an agreed level of outperformance over a set time period.
Performance fees are recognised when the fee amount can be estimated reliably and it is virtually certain that the fee will be received.
Fees are normally recognised at the end of a performance period.
Interest receivable is recognised using the effective interest method.
Revenue comprises: 2011 2010 m m Management fees 1,267.0 1,161.9 Performance fees 37.8 73.4 Other fees 161.2 159.5 Interest income receivable by Private Banking subsidiaries 35.9 44.5 1,501.9 1,439.3 Fee income includes 588.0 million 2010: 563.0 million of fees from collective investment vehicles that are deemed to be related parties by virtue of the investment management agreements in place between the Group and these vehicles.
3 Cost of sales Fee expense principally comprises commissions and distribution fees payable to financial institutions which distribute ourproducts, investment platform providers and financial advisers.
The expense is generally based on an agreed percentage of the value of the investments placed with the Group.
Private Banking pays interest on deposits taken.
For Private Banking, earning a net interest margin is a core activity: interest payable in respect of these activities is therefore recorded separately from interest payable elsewhere in the business.
Fee expense is recognised over the period for which the service is provided.
Fees paid in advance to the distributor in respect of structured product funds and the reimbursement of any marketing and distribution fees are deferred and charged to the income statement over the life of the fund, as such service is provided.
Fees paid to the distributor but not yet charged to the income statement are charged on redemption where they are irrecoverable.
Interest payable on banking activities comprises interest payable on deposits taken and debt securities in issue.
Interest payable is recognised using the effective interest method.

indd 94 13 03 2012 01:26 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 95 Financial report Notes to the accounts 4 Net gains on financial instruments and other income The Group holds some of its capital, known as seed capital, in investments to support the development of investment strategies.
Investments are also held for regulatory capital purposes in certain operating entities and as a stock of units to facilitate purchases and sales by the UK unit trust manager.
The majority of this capital is invested in financial instruments such as fixed income debt instruments and equities.
Net gains and losses on such instruments, principally representing market movements, are recognised in this line of the income statement as are any gains and losses on derivatives which mainly arise from hedging activities.
The investments are referred to as at fair value through profit or loss.
Certain other investments are classified as available-for-sale.
This classification is typically selected when the investment is expected to be held for the long term but not necessarily to maturity and where short-term volatility does not reflect long-term expected returns.
Availablefor-sale investments are also marked to market but the gains and losses on those investments are only recorded here if the investment is impaired, sold or otherwise realised for example, through distribution to investors.
The total return on investments also includes interest, which is included in note 6 Net finance income.
Other income includes trading profits onbuying and selling units in funds, gains and losses on foreign exchange and rent receivable from subletting properties.
Gains and losses on financial instruments Gains or losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss, together with transaction costs, are recognised in the incomestatement.
Gains or losses on available-for-sale investments are recognised as a separate component of equity through other comprehensive income until the investment is sold, collected or otherwise disposed of, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.
Assets categorised as available-for-sale are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for impairment.
Where, in prior years, investments have been reclassified out of the fair value through profit or loss category and into the available-forsale category, they have been reclassified at their fair value on the date of reclassification.
Gains or losses on reclassified investments arerecognised and accounted for after reclassification in the same way as other available-for-sale investments.
Carried interest on private equity investments is recognised in the income statement in accordance with the substance of the relevant contractual agreement.
Where there is a contractual agreement to receive such amounts subject to the fulfilment of specified conditions, capital gains receivable are recognised in the income statement on an accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant contractual agreement.
Where there is no such agreement, capital gains receivable are recognised when the right to receive the payment is established.
Net gains and losses on foreign exchange The Groups accounting policy is included within the Presentation of the financial statements note.
Net gains and losses taken to the income statement in respect of financial assets and liabilities are: 2011 2010 m m Net losses gains on financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss 8.6 32.3 Net gains on disposal of available-for-sale financial assets 7.8 12.9 Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets equities 2.4 2.7 Net gains on disposal or impairment of available-for-sale financial assets 5.4 10.2 Gains on disposals and liquidation of subsidiary undertakings 8.5 Gains made by the UK unit trust manager from buying and selling units 10.6 12.4 Other income 6.6 5.8 Net gains on financial instruments and other income 14.0 69.2 Included in net gains on financial instruments and other income: Net gains on fair value hedges hedged items 0.4 8.2 Net losses on fair value hedges hedging instruments 0.6 7.2 Hedging ineffectiveness recognised in net gains on financial instruments and other income 0.2 1.0 Net gains on financial instruments and other income includes gains of 0.4 million 2010: 14.6 million in respect of those collective investment vehicles that are deemed to be related parties by virtue of the investment management agreements in place between the Groupand these vehicles.
indd 95 13 03 2012 01:26 96 Financial report Notes to the accounts 5 Operating expenses Operating expenses represent the Groups administrative expenses.
The biggest constituent is employee benefits, the charge for which is shown below, but other costs such as those for accommodation, IT, electronic information systems and marketing are also included, along with charges for provisioning.
Employee compensation is managed to a target long-term ratio of 45% compensation to operating net revenue which may fluctuate dependent on market conditions.
Total costs are managed to a target long-term ratio of 70% total costs to net revenue, which may also fluctuate.
The revenue to compensation ratio in particular provides some flexibility to manage the overall cost base.
Operating expenses are recognised on an accruals basis as services are provided.
Costs under operating leases are charged to the income statement in equal amounts over the periods of the leases.
Included within the employee benefits expense are employee sharebased payments and deferred cash awards.
The accounting policy in respect of employee share-based payments is set out in note 27.
Deferred cash awards take the form of notional investments in funds managed by the Group and the liability is recorded at fair value.
These awards are charged to the income statement over their performance and vesting periods.
Awards that lapse or are forfeited are credited to the income statement in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited.
Pension costs are explained in note 26.
Operating expenses include: 2011 2010 m m Salaries and other remuneration 455.3 444.4 Social security costs 39.4 48.0 Pension costs 5.1 13.1 Employee benefits expense 499.8 505.5 Operating lease payments 33.6 31.4 Audit fees payable for the audit of the Company and consolidated financial statements 0.6 0.6 Audit fees payable for the audit of the Companys subsidiaries 2.1 2.0 Other audit services provided pursuant to legislation 0.4 0.4 Tax services 0.9 0.9 Other services 0.7 0.5 Audit and non-audit fees 4.7 4.4 Other operating expenses 223.7 232.7 Operating expenses 761.8 774.0 Details relating to emoluments paid to Directors and Directors rights to deferred cash and share awards are included in the Remunerationreport.

Investments and cash excluding those of the Private Banking entities are mainly managed by the Group Treasury to earn competitive rates and ensure liquidity throughout the Group.
The Groups cash and interestbearing securities comprise a significant amount of Private Banking balances.
The interest earned on those balances isincluded in revenue.
7 Tax expense The Group is headquartered in the UK and pays taxes according to the rates applicable in the countries and states in which itoperates.
Most taxes are recorded in the income statement see part a of this note below and relate to taxes payable for the reporting period current tax but the charge also includes benefits and charges relating to tax payable for future periods because income or expenses are recognised in a different period for tax and accounting purposes deferred tax.
Some current and deferred taxes are recorded through other comprehensive income, mainly relating to the Groups defined pension schemes see part b below, or directly to equity where the tax arises from changes in the value of remuneration settled as shares seepart c below.

The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted figure recalculates that number as if all in-the-money share options i. e. those that would be expected to be exercised as they have value to the option holder had also been exercised in the period.
Shares that may be issued are not taken into account if the impact does not reduce the earnings per share.

10 Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables include prepayments and deposits with banks in the form of bullion as well as amounts the Group is due to receive from third parties in the normal course of business.
These include fees as well as settlement accounts for transactions undertaken.
These receivables are normally settled by receipt of cash.
Trade and other receivables are stated after deducting provisions for bad and doubtful debts.
Prepayments arise where the Group pays cash in advance for services.
As the service is provided, the prepayment is reduced and the operating expense recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables, other than deposits with banks in the form of bullion which are recorded at fair value, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
indd 99 13 03 2012 01:26 100 Financial report Notes to the accounts 11 Financial assets The Group holds financial assets including Private Banking customer deposits, equities, debt securities and derivatives tosupport its Group capital strategies and as part of its Private Banking book.
As part of the latter, the Group enters into derivatives on behalf of clients in order to enable them to participate in the derivatives market this is referred to as customerfacilitation and is explained in note 21.
The Group initially records all financial assets at fair value, which is normally the cost of acquiring the asset or the amount loaned to customers.
The Group classifies each financial asset as either being held at fair value fair value through profit or loss and available-for-sale or at cost held to maturity and loans and receivables.
The classification is, in part, dependent on accounting rules but with some scope for the Group to select a treatment.
The fair value of financial instruments may require some judgement as explained below or may be derived from readily available sources.
The degree of judgement involved is quantified in the fair value measurements section below, although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value is more or less likely to be realised.
These values are updated at each reporting date based on the most relevant evidence of fair value at that date.
Investments held at cost change where there is evidence that the full amount will not be recovered, in which case the cost is adjusted to reflect the recoverable amount: or, if such amounts were acquired at a premium or discount to the expected proceeds, after discounting for the time value of money, the carrying amount is adjusted over time to the amount recoverable on maturity.
Financial assets are classified as either available-for-sale, at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables or held to maturity.
Recognition and measurement All purchases and sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the time frame generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace are recognised on the trade date, i. e. the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred andthe Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Where financial assets have been categorised as being available-for-sale or at fair value through profit or loss, all such investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the consideration given, including, in respect of assets classified as available-for-sale, acquisition costsassociated with the investment.
After initial recognition, the investments are measured at fair value.
All financial assets held at fair valuethrough profit or loss, except for those held within the life company see note 16, are classified as held for trading.
The fair value reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the difference between the cost or, if the asset has been reclassified, the fair value at date of reclassification and the fair value of unimpaired financial assets classified as available-for-sale.
Derivative contracts are included at fair value at the year-end date within Financial assets or Financial liabilities.
Fair value represents the amount at which a derivative could be exchanged in a transaction between willing parties.
For investments that are actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by reference to official quoted market bid prices.
For investments that are not actively traded in organised financial markets, fair value is determined by using quoted prices from third parties such as brokers, market makers and pricing agencies.
For private equity investments where there is no quoted market price, fair value is determined with reference to International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines or by independent professional valuers.
In such circumstances, fair values are derived using the most appropriate technique, examples of which include theuse of earnings multiples applying an appropriate earnings multiple to the earnings of individual businesses being valued in order toderive a value and the values assigned to recent similar transactions.
Loans and receivables and held to maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments andfixed maturity.
Where the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold such assets to maturity, it is able to categorise such investments as held to maturity.
Such assets are held principally by Private Banking.
All investments are initially recognised at fair value, being the consideration given, including, where appropriate, acquisition charges associated with the investment.
They are subsequently measured at amortised cost, being the measurement on initial recognition less principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulative amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated using the effective interest method of any difference between that initial amount and the maturity amount, and minus any reduction directly or through the use of an allowance account for impairment or irrecoverability.
Impairments for specific bad and doubtful debts are made against loans and receivables and held to maturity investments to reflect an assessment of irrecoverability and are deducted from the relevant assets.
Such impairments are determined based on revised estimates of future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate and are recorded in the income statement.
Hedge accounting Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, the Group formally documents the relationship between the derivative and any hedged item, its risk management objectives, its strategy for undertaking the various hedging transactions and its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value of hedged items.
indd 100 13 03 2012 01:26 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 101 Financial report Notes to the accounts 11 Financial assets continued In respect of fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from re-measuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting isdiscontinued when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the instrument is derecognised.
In respect of hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
On disposal of the foreign operation, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised directly in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement.

The carrying value of the reclassified financial assets at 31 December 2011 is 31.0 million 2010: 42.0 million.
The Group has a total net investment of 97.3 million 2010: 89.6 million in collective investment vehicles that, by virtue of the investment management agreements in place between the Group and those vehicles, are considered to be related parties.

Fair value measurements The Group holds financial assets that are measured at fair value subsequent to initial recognition.
Each instrument has been categorised within one of three levels using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
These levels are based on the degree to which the fair value is observable and are defined as follows: L evel 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and principally comprise investments in quoted equities, daily priced funds, gilts and exchange-traded derivatives: L evel 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices and principally comprise corporate bonds and foreign exchange contracts: and L evel 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data and principally comprise investments in private equity and hedge funds.
The Groups financial assets held at fair value excluding those held in the life company see note 16 at the year-end date are analysed as follows: 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Non-current financial assets: Equities 3.7 5.4 44.6 53.7 Debt securities 0.1 2.9 3.0 Derivative contracts 11.8 11.8 3.8 20.1 44.6 68.5 Current financial assets: Equities 289.3 36.3 122.1 447.7 Debt securities 292.7 25.6 318.3 Derivative contracts 1.0 32.7 33.7 583.0 94.6 122.1 799.7 586.8 114.7 166.7 868.2 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Non-current financial assets: Equities 3.2 5.8 54.9 63.9 Debt securities 0.2 2.5 2.7 Derivative contracts 17.1 17.1 3.4 25.4 54.9 83.7 Current financial assets: Equities 299.4 22.2 147.3 468.9 Debt securities 415.5 4.4 419.9 Other listed investments 52.3 52.3 Derivative contracts 18.6 13.0 31.6 785.8 39.6 147.3 972.7 789.2 65.0 202.2 1,056.4 Schroders | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 58205 TEXT pgs092-108.

Estimates and judgements Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are periodically evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable.
The resulting accounting estimates will seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the carrying amounts of financial assets are discussed below.
Valuation of financial assets where there is no quoted price Such assets principally consist of investments in private equity, hedge funds and funds of hedge funds.
The determination of fair value requires significant judgement, particularly in determining changes in fair value since the last formal valuation by the fund manager or adviser where this is performed before year end.
In making this judgement the Group evaluates amongst other factors the effect of cash distributions and changes in the business outlook for each fund.
Impairment of financial assets categorised as available-for-sale, loans and receivables and held to maturity Such assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period for impairment.
If the year-end fair value of an asset is less than the cost or deemed cost of that asset, the Group will assess whether there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In respect of equity products, consideration is given to the extent to which the fair value of an instrument is below cost and to the length of time that the fair value of an instrument has been below cost.
12 Associates and joint ventures Associates are companies the Group partly owns and over which it has influence, for example, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions, but not control.
Joint ventures are companies in which the Group has an investment where it, along with one or more other shareholders, has contractually agreed to share control of the business and where the major decisions require the unanimous consent of the joint venturers.
In both cases, the Groups income statement reflects its share of the entitys profit or loss after tax: and the statement of financial position records the Groups share of the net assets of the entity plus any goodwill that arose on initial purchase.
As with subsidiaries, intercompany transactions are eliminated.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The investments are carried in the statement of financial position at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate or joint venture.
The income statement includes the Groups post-tax share of associates and joint ventures profits or losses for the year.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate or joint venture of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in that associate or joint venture.
The associates and joint ventures reserve in the statement of changes in equity represents the amount of related profit or loss since the acquisition of an associate or joint venture less dividends received and other distributions of profit.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates or joint ventures is included in the amount of the investments and is regularly reviewed for impairment.

These include leasehold improvements, office equipment, computers and cars.
The cost of these assets is recognised in the income statement overtime as a depreciation charge.
These assets are normally depreciated over three to five years.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historic cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes both the original purchase price of theasset and any costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided on the cost less the estimated residual value at the end of its economic life over its useful life on a straight-line basis at rates varying between 20per cent.
Depreciation rates and methods, as well as the residual values at the end of the useful life of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
Depreciation of property, plant andequipment is recorded in the income statement as an operating expense.

This premium reflects additional value that the Group determines to be attached to the business, but which is not represented by the fair value of net assets acquired.
Intangible assets include contractual agreements to manage client funds and gain additional access to new or existing clients, geographies and brand names.
Where such assets can be identified, they are recorded by the Group as intangible assets arising from business combinations and charged to the income statement over time.
Consideration for business in excess of net tangible and intangible assets is known as goodwill.
Goodwill is not charged to the income statement unless its value has diminished.
After acquisition, the business is normally integrated fully into the existing Group.
The Group therefore assesses whether goodwill has become impaired based onthe expected future returns of the relevant business segment as a whole.
Asa result it is rare that the goodwill will be considered to be impaired.
Software purchased for use in the business is also referred to as an intangible asset.
The cost of purchasing software is taken to the income statement over time as an amortisation charge.
The treatment is similar to property, plant and equipment and the asset is normally amortised evenly over three years.
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Any non-controlling interest in the acquiree is measured at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts which represented the amortised value at the date of conversion subject to annual test for impairment.
indd 105 13 03 2012 01:26 106 Financial report Notes to the accounts 14 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of thefair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
Costs relating to business combinations are taken to the income statement where they are recorded within Operating expenses.
The Groups intangible assets comprise software together with an immaterial amount of acquired intangible assets such as future revenues from investment management contracts and client relationships acquired through a business combination.
The costs of purchasing and implementing software, together with associated relevant expenditure, are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits that are attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the cost of the assets can be measured reliably.
Software is recorded initially at cost and then amortised over its useful life, on a straight-line basis, as an operating expense.

Estimates and judgements At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether there is any indication that goodwill or an intangible asset in use may be impaired.
If any such indication exists and the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount at that time, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
The more material judgement applies to goodwill.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined using a discounted cash flow model, details of which are provided below.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and cannot subsequently be reversed.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
For all relevant acquisitions, the lowest level of CGU the Group uses to determine impairment is segment level.
indd 106 13 03 2012 01:26 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 107 Financial report Notes to the accounts 14 Goodwill and intangible assets continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations applying a discounted cash flow model.
The key assumptions on which management have based their five-year cash flow projections are based on market growth rates of 2 per cent.
based on the Groups view of anticipated future market movements, a pre-tax discount rate of 14 per cent.
expected fund flows based on the aggregation of expectations of individual countries and expected changes to margins based on an analysis of the current fee structure flexed to take into account expected changes in product mix and the proportion of rebates payable to external distributors.
Based on the results of calculations, there is no indication that the goodwill is impaired.
The sensitivity of the carrying amounts of goodwill to the methods and assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amounts of the CGUs is small due to the amount of goodwill on the Groups statement of financial position relative to the size of the Groups estimations of future profitability within the business segments to which that goodwill has been allocated.
Movements in the growth rate and or the discount rate of 1 per cent.
would not lead to the recognition of any impairment charge.
A comparison of actual results to the projected results used to assess goodwill impairment in prior years reveals that the Group would have recognised no changes 2010: nil to its goodwill asset in the year as a result of inaccuracies in its projections.
15 Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities represent amounts of tax that will become recoverable and payable respectively in future accounting periods.
They generally arise as a result of timing differences, where the time at which profits and losses are recognised for tax purposes differs from the time at which the relevant transaction is recorded in the accounts.
A deferred tax asset represents a tax reduction which is expected to arise in a future period as a result of a transaction in the current or an earlier period.
A deferred tax liability, conversely, represents taxes which will become payable in a future period as a result ofa current or an earlier transaction.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on all taxable and deductible temporary differences at the year-end date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
However, if the deferred taxarises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither the accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the year-end date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the deductibletemporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Groupand it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax liabilities represent temporary differences where the accounting profits are recorded prior to taxable profits, including thosearising from deferred remuneration.

Thesehave been recognised based on the share prices as at 31 December 2011.
If the asset were recognised at the share price on 2 March 2012, deferred tax assets would be increased by 5.5 million, of which 1.1 million would be recognised as a credit in the consolidated income statement.
A deferred tax asset of 25.8 million 2010: 11.3 million relating to realised and unrealised capital losses has not been recognised as thereis insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable gains in the future against which the deferred tax asset could be utilised.
A deferred tax asset of 18.1 million 2010: 27.3 million relating to losses and other temporary differences has not been recognised as there is insufficient evidence that there will be sufficient taxable profit against which these losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
The aggregate amount of gross temporary differences arising from unremitted profits in subsidiaries is 8.1 million 2010: 12.5 million.
Deferred tax has not been provided as the relevant parent company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The life company provides investment products through a life assurance wrapper.
Theinvestment products do not provide cover for any insurance risk and are therefore recognised and accounted for as financial instruments and presented as financial liabilities due to life company investors policyholders within unit-linked liabilities.
The investment product is almost identical to that of a unit trust.
The Group earns revenue from managing the investment, butbecause it is a life assurance product, the Group has to include the assets under management on its statement of financialposition together with the liability to investors.
Assets held to cover unit-linked liabilities represent financial assets and include investments in authorised unit trusts, other financial assets and cash.
All assets excluding financial assets not at fair value such as cash and accrued income which are held at amortised cost and derivatives which are held for trading and measured at fair value have been designated as fair value through profit or loss, representing assets held to cover investor obligations.
Where the life company has a controlling interest in an authorised unit trust, this is consolidated.
The net assets attributable to third party investors in the authorised unit trust are included in unit-linked liabilities.
The direct investment portfolio and the consolidated authorised unit trusts may include financial liabilities such as derivative contracts.
These financial liabilities are included in unit-linked liabilities.
Unit-linked liabilities are designated as fair value through profit or loss except for derivative contracts which are held for trading and measured at fair value.
Gains and losses from assets and liabilities held to cover investor obligations are attributable to investors in the life company or third party investors in the consolidated authorised unit trust.
As a result, any gain or loss is offset by a change in the obligation to investors.
Fees earned by the Group are included in net revenue.
The life companys assets are regarded as current assets as they represent amounts available to unit-linked policyholders or third party investors in authorised unit trusts who are able to withdraw their funds on call, subject to certain restrictions in the case of illiquidity.
Unit-linked liabilities comprise: 2011 2010 m m Financial liabilities due to life company investors 7,826.6 7,439.3 1 Financial liabilities due to third party investors 818.6 834.1 8,645.2 8,273.4 1 Such liabilities arise in respect of assets controlled by the Group that are beneficially owned by third parties.
The Group has no exposure to market risk, credit risk or liquidity risk in relation to the investments of the life company as the risks and rewards associated with its investments are normally borne by the investors in the life companys investment products or third party investors in the consolidated authorised unit trusts and not by the life company itself.

These include expense accruals as well as settlement accounts amounts due to be paid for transactions undertaken.
Trade creditors are costs that have been billed, accruals represent costs, including remuneration, that are not yet billed or due for payment.
Trade and other payables held at fair value comprise deferred cash awards deferred employee remuneration payable in cash and bullion deposits by customers.
Trade payables, other than deferred cash awards see note 5 and bullion deposits by customers, are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost.
Deferred cash awards and bullion deposits by customers are recorded at fair value.
18 Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities principally comprise deposits by Private Banking customers and banking counterparties.
They also include derivatives held for either customer facilitation in Private Banking see note 21 or for the hedging of risk exposures within Group capital.
Customer accounts, deposits by banks, bank borrowings and loan notes are recorded at the amount deposited: other financial liabilities are recorded at the fair value of the liability.
The fair value measurements section below quantifies the level of judgement involved in determining fair value although this does not necessarily indicate that the fair value ismore or less likely to equal the actual settlement cost.
Smaller liabilities arise from time to time in respect of temporary bank borrowings and liabilities in respect of consolidated funds consolidation normally occurs when the Groups investment stake in afund exceeds 50 per cent.
and frequently occurs in respect of seed capital investments.
When this happens, the Group has to account for the fund in its statement of financial position as if it were wholly-owned by the Group, but record an additional liability representing the fair value of the proportion of the fund owned by third party investors.
This can also occur through investment bythe life company but those third party investors are included in unit-linked liabilities see note 16.
Customer accounts, deposits by banks, bank borrowings and loan notes are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, the liabilities are accounted for at amortised cost using the effective interest method taking into account any attributable transaction costs.
All other financial liabilities are held at fair value through profit or loss and held for trading.
Gains and losses on derivative contracts and liabilities of consolidated funds are recognised within net gains on financial instruments and other income in the income statement.

indd 112 13 03 2012 01:33 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 113 Financial report Notes to the accounts 19 Provisions and contingent liabilities Provisions are liabilities where there is uncertainty over the timing of settlement or amount and therefore usually require the use of estimates.
Any differences between those estimates and the amounts for which the Group actually becomes liable are taken to the income statement as additional charges where the Group has underestimated and credits where the Group has overestimated.
Where the estimated timing and settlement is longer term the amount is discounted using a rate reflecting specific risks associated with the provision.
Contingent liabilities are potential liabilities where there is even greater uncertainty but a reasonable possibility that they willcrystallise.
Contingent liabilities are only disclosed and not included within the statement of financial position.
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that anoutflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the existence of an obligation is possible, dependent on uncertain events not wholly within the control of the Group, or a present obligation cannot be measured reliably, or it is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, the Group discloses a contingent liability but does not record a provision.
For onerous lease provisions or other longer-term provisions, where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value ofmoney and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as an interest expense.

The Group has performed an assessment of the timing and amount and periodically reviews this assessment.
For certain provisions, including the provision for onerous leases, there is greater certainty as the cash flows have largely been determined.
However, the onerous lease provision also includes an assessment of potential cash inflows where these are not contractually binding from sub-letting arrangements.
The Group makes periodic assessment of all cash flows, including taking external advice where appropriate, to determine any appropriate provision.
Some matters may be settled through commercial negotiation as well as being covered by the Groups insurance arrangements.
The Group has made provisions based on a reasonable expectation of likely outflows.
However, the results of negotiations and insurance cover may result in different outcomes.

The collateral may be in the form of cash, fiduciary deposits or securities held by Private Banking but may also include charges over property or third party guarantees.
20 Financial instrument risk management As a result of its operations, the Group is exposed to multiple forms of risk including: i the risk that money owed to the Group will not be received credit risk : ii the risk that the Group may not have sufficient cash available to pay its creditors as they falldue liquidity risk : and iii the risk that the value of assets will fluctuate as a result of movements in stock market prices, interest rates, foreign exchange rates or a combination of these market risk.
The management of such risks is fundamental tothe well-being of the Group.
The note sets out the nature of the risks, the quantification and the management of those risks.
The Group is subject to market risk throughout its business.
In addition, operational, liquidity and credit risk exposures exist within thebusiness.
The effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Groups senior management.
TheAudit and Risk Committee provide oversight and the Risk and Compliance functions are responsible for monitoring the overall risk andregulatory environment.
The Group has established a control environment that ensures risks are reviewed regularly and that risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition, an independent assessment of therisk management process and the fundamental risk assumptions is provided by Internal Audit.
The financial risks of these products are largely borne bythe third party investors, consistent with other investment products managed by the Group.
However, since the life company provides the investment products, both the investments and the third party obligations are recorded on the statement of financial position.
Financialinstrument risk management in respect of the life company is set out in note 16.
The Groups primary exposure to financial instrument risk is derived from the financial instruments it holds.
In addition, due to the nature of the business, the Groups exposure extends to the impact on investment management and other fees that are determined on the basis of apercentage of assets under management and are therefore impacted by financial instrument risk exposure of our clients the secondary exposure.
This note deals with the primary exposure only.

indd 114 13 03 2012 16:21 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 115 Financial report Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instrument risk management continued i Operating capital Operating capital is the capital required to meet the Groups regulatory and working capital requirements.
The Group holds a surplus of capital over the regulatory capital requirements and where this is surplus to immediate working capital requirements it is managed by Group Treasury.
Recognised regulatory bodies, such as the FSA in the UK, oversee the activities of many of the Groups operating subsidiaries and impose minimum capital requirements on the subsidiaries.
The Groups policy is that subsidiaries should have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate standing with counterparties and meet working capital requirements.
The Group Capital Committee reviews this.
Schroders plc is regulated by the FSA as a UK consolidated group.
Its last submitted capital resources, using the calculation of capital resources of banks, amounted to 1,373 million 2010: 1,266 million and Pillar 1 capital requirements of 293 million 2010: 294 million.
The Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP carried out in 2011 under Pillar 2 concluded that 428 million 2010: 526 million capital should be retained in order to be able to meet an unexpected one-year loss with a confidence level of 99.5 per cent.
The ICAAP methodology was substantially revised during 2011 to incorporate more sophisticated risk assessment techniques, in particular a new Monte Carlo simulation approach to the estimation of capital to address operational risk.
In addition, the amount of capital estimated for pension obligation risk was reduced, reflecting both the actions taken to mitigate exposure to the defined benefit scheme and FSA guidance in relation to the appropriate level of capital required by asset management and banking entities.
Restating the 2010 figure using the new ICAAP methodology would produce an estimate of 411 million.
All regulated entities within the Group complied at all times with all of the externally imposed regulatory capital requirements.
ii Investment capital Investment capital is the capital that is not required for the regulatory and working capital requirements of the business.
It is invested in the following principal areas: Cash G overnment bonds and bills Debt securities Third party hedge funds Currency Commodities Private equity Seed capital Investment capital is used to seed new investment strategies, co-invest selectively alongside our clients and finance organic and inorganic growth opportunities.
Seed capital is deployed principally to support the growth of the Asset Management business.
Investment capital is deployed in accordance with limits approved by the Board.
Investment capital is also held to support the organic development of existing and new business strategies that fit with the existing asset management franchise and to respond to other investment and growth opportunities, such as acquisitions that will accelerate the development of the business, as they arise.
iii Other assets Other assets comprise goodwill, other acquired intangible assets and the surplus on the UK defined benefit pension scheme.

indd 116 13 03 2012 01:33 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 117 Financial report Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instrument risk management continued b Credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk the main components of which are interest rate, foreign exchange and pricing risks i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that Schroders counterparty to a financial instrument will cause the Group financial loss by failing to discharge anobligation.
For this purpose, the impact on fair value of a credit loss in a portfolio of investments is excluded and is addressed within Pricing Risk below.
The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Group carefully manages its exposure to credit risk by approving lending policies including types of acceptable collateral and minimum lending margins, setting limits for individuals exposures and sectors and by taking security.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets: in addition the Group holds collateral on its loans and advances to customers and certain derivative positions.
A breakdown of the Groups relevant financial assets by credit rating is set out below.
Private Banking activities All individual facility requests are presented to the relevant Private Banking asset and liability management and credit committees and exposures against limits are monitored daily.
Loans and advances to customers are secured on a range of assets including property both residential and commercial, cash, client portfolios and insurance policies.
It is the policy of Private Banking not to advance client facilities on an unsecured basis.
Portfolios held as collateral are marked to market daily and positions compared to customer loans.
Limits are set for the reduction in market value of each type of collateral, depending on the perceived risk associated with the collateral.
Clients are contacted once these limits are breached so that action can be taken before the outstanding loan balances exceed the fair value of the collateral.
Private Banking take a conservative approach to their treasury investments placing them with, or purchasing debt securities issued by, well-rated UK and overseas banks, central banks and well-rated sovereigns.
Most debt securities held within the Private Banking treasury risk book are classified as held to maturity financial assets and are unsecured.
Policies and limits are set by the relevant Private Banking asset and liability management and credit committee and monitored daily.
All instruments held within Private Banking are rated Aor better.
Other activities Fee debtors and other receivables arise as a result of the Groups asset management activities and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant and, unless a client has withdrawn all funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
Although the Group is usually managing client cash representing a large multiple of the amount owed to the Group bythe client, the Group does not hold any of the assets it invests on behalf of its clients as collateral.
Fee debtors past due but not yet impaired as at 31 December 2011 were 36.2 million 2010: 5.5 million, of which the majority was settled by 4 January 2012.
The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to credit risk arising from debt securities and derivatives within the investment portfolio by adopting aconservative approach to investing.
Within the cash and government bond portfolios, deposits are placed with well-rated banks that have been approved and which are monitored by Group Risk.
Derivative positions are taken in exchange-traded securities where there is minimal credit risk.
Forward foreign exchange positions generally have a maturity of one month.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents in the non-Private Banking entities are invested primarily in current accounts and on deposit with well-rated UK and overseas banks.
indd 117 13 03 2012 01:33 118 Financial report Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instrument risk management continued ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that Schroders cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
Private Banking activities The principal liquidity risk the Group faces concerns its Private Banking liabilities.
The liquidity policy is to maintain sufficient liquidity to cover any cash flow funding, meet all obligations as they fall due and maintain solvency in the Groups private banks.
The Asset Management and Group segments hold cash of 807.2 million 2010: 641.0 million.
The Groups policy is that its subsidiaries should trade solvently and have adequate capital for all activities undertaken in the normal course of business.
In particular, all companies should have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements, keep an appropriate credit standing with counterparties, and maintain sufficient liquid funds to meet peak working capital requirements.
Financial liabilities relating to other operating entities are 16.7 million 2010: 28.2 million, all of which are current.
The Group has a committed loan facility of 250.0 million 2010: 250.0 million.
The facility expires on 23 September 2013. iii Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
indd 118 13 03 2012 01:33 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 119 Financial report Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instrument risk management continued Private Banking activities In Private Banking, interest rates are monitored against policies and limits set by the relevant risk committee.
Private Bankings treasury policy is to hedge fixed-rate assets and liabilities beyond one year back to the floating rate: outright interest raterisk arises mainly from the decision to allow a limited amount of mismatch between the related cash inflows and outflows associated with interest.
Within Private Banking, there are sensitivity-based and stress-based models used for monitoring interest rate risk.
These involve assessing the impact on the Groups net worth against a prescribed basis point rise in interest rates with extreme scenarios for the stress tests.
Theimpact is calculated regularly for each currency and in aggregate.
Other activities Cash held by the other operating companies is not normally placed on deposit for longer than three months.
The Groups capital includes investments in government bonds managed by the Groups fixed income fund managers.
These investments are managed to a maximum average duration of two years and are concentrated in UK and US issues.
Government bonds issued by selected AAA rated countries can also be held.
The fund managers may reduce the average duration with the use of future contracts at their discretion.
Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.
Private Banking activities In Private Banking, some loans and advances to clients as well as a proportion of the treasury activities are undertaken in foreign currencies: this is managed on a daily basis to reduce currency exposures to low levels.
Limits regarding the amount of foreign currency riskare set by the relevant risk committee and monitored daily.
As a result of the low level of currency mismatch, the FSAs Basic Methodology for calculating the exposure is appropriate and is used.
Other activities The Groups policy in relation to revenue, expenditure and capital currency exposure relating to Asset Management activities is generally notto hedge, as the Groups revenue is earned and expenditure incurred in many currencies and the resulting exposure is considered part of the business.
The Group also has exposure to foreign currency through investments in a currency other than Sterling.
These investments are normally held through foreign operations and any currency gains or losses on translation are therefore recorded in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts with third parties to mitigate this exposure to currency movements.
The gains or losses on the hedging instruments are included in the statement of other comprehensive income.
The use of such instruments is subject to the approval of the Group Capital Committee.
indd 119 13 03 2012 01:33 120 Financial report Notes to the accounts 20 Financial instrument risk management continued Pricing risk Pricing risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk.
In respect of financial instrument risk, the Groups exposure to pricing risk is principally through investments held in investment capital as well as some investments held within regulatory capital.
However, the more significant risk is the impact on the Groups fee income as this is principally determined on percentages of the fair value of assets under management.
This risk cannot be easily mitigated but is addressed to some extent by net new business.
The exposure to pricing risk is monitored by the Group Capital Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not hedge exposure to price risk except in respect of seed capital and employee compensation awards in the form of fund awards when it is considered that the amount of risk is material and an effective hedge is available.
The sensitivities to market risk are estimated as follows: 2011 2010 A reasonable Increase A reasonable Increase change in the Increase decrease change in the Increase decrease variable within decrease in other variable within decrease in other the next in post-tax components the next in post-tax components calendar year profit of equity calendar year profit of equity 1 Variable % m m % m m 2 Interest rates increase 0.5 3 2 10 decrease US dollar against Sterling strengthen 10 2 14 10 5 10 weaken 8 2 9 12 5 10 Euro against Sterling strengthen 8 10 6 8 9 13 weaken 12 12 8 12 11 16 3 FTSE All Share Index increase 20 1 13 20 4 16 decrease 20 1 13 20 4 16 1 The underlying assumption is that there is one variable increase decrease with all other variables held constant.
2 The following are underlying assumptions made in the model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits and other components of equity: The fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates.
Within Private Banking, the fixed rate financial assets will be rebalanced to the higher lower market interest rates.
Within other operating entities, funds would be reinvested in similar variable interest-bearing debt securities on maturity.
3 The following are underlying assumptions made in the model used to calculate the effect on post-tax profits and other components of equity: Changes in the FTSE All Share Index correlate to changes in the value of the Groups equity funds.
The Groups investment in debt securities, hedge funds and multi-asset investments have no correlation to the FTSE All Share Index.
The Groups private equity investments are correlated to the FTSE All Share Index.
The market risk on the Groups seed capital is hedged effectively, except for property investments, which are assumed to have no correlation to the FTSE All Share Index.
21 Derivative contracts a The Groups use of derivatives The Group holds derivatives for risk management, to assist its Private Banking customers who wish to buy or sell derivative instruments customer facilitation and, to a limited extent, within its investment portfolios to provide exposure to market returns.
The Group most commonly uses forward foreign exchange contracts where it agrees to buy or sell specified amounts of a named currency at a future date, allowing the Group effectively to fix exchange rates so that it can avoid unpredictable gains and losses on receivables and payables in foreign currencies.
The Group uses equity contracts to hedge market-related gains and losses on its seed capital investments where the purpose of investing is to establish a new product rather than gain additional market exposure.
Equity contracts are also used as a hedge against liabilities relating to remuneration that is deferred and settled in the form of fund awards.
Interest rate contracts are used to hedge exposure to fixed or floating rates ofinterest in order to match a liability.
Risk management: the Group actively seeks to limit and manage its exposures to risk where that exposure is not desired by the Group.
Thismay take the form of unwanted exposures to a particular currency, type of interest rate or other price risk.
By entering into derivative contracts, the Group is able to mitigate or eliminate such exposures.
The principal financial instrument risk the Group faces through such use of derivative contracts is credit risk.
Customer facilitation: The Groups Private Banking entities are involved in providing portfolio management, banking and investment advisory services, primarily to private clients.
In carrying out this business they transact as agent and as principal in financial assets and liabilities in order to meet customer facilitation requirements.
Private Bankings policy is to hedge, as appropriate, exchange rate and interest rate risk on its customer facilitation positions.
This hedging of equal and opposite risks seeks to mitigate market risk, but does not eliminate the possibility of credit risk.
For details of how the Group manages its exposures to credit risk, see b below and note 20.
indd 120 13 03 2012 01:33 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 121 Financial report Notes to the accounts 21 Derivative contracts continued b The derivatives used by the Group Currency forwards represent commitments to sell or purchase foreign and domestic currency.
Currency forwards are contractual obligations to receive or pay amounts based on changes in currency rates or to buy or sell foreign currency or a financial instrument on a future date ata specified price.
For currency forward contracts, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the fair value of the contracts.
Currency and interest rate swaps are commitments to exchange one set of cash flows for another.
Swaps result in an economic exchange of currencies or interest rates for example, fixed rate for floating rate or a combination of all these i. e. cross-currency interest rate swaps.
No exchange of principal takes place, except in the case of certain currency swaps.
The Groups credit risk is represented by the potential cost to replace the swap contracts if counterparties fail to perform their obligations.
This risk is monitored on an ongoing basis with reference to the current fair value, a proportion of the notional amount of the contracts and the liquidity of the market.
To control the level ofcredit risk taken, the Group assesses counterparties using the same techniques as for its lending activities.
Foreign exchange, equity and interest rate options are contractual agreements under which the seller grants the purchaser the right, but notthe obligation, either to buy a call option or sell a put option at or by a set date or during a set period, a specific amount of a foreign currency or a financial instrument at a predetermined price.
The seller receives a premium from the purchaser and assumes foreign exchange, equity or interest rate risk.
Options may either be exchange-traded or negotiated between the Group and a customer or market counterparty.
The Group is exposed to credit risk on purchased options only, and only to the extent of their carrying amount, which is their fair value.
The fair value of derivative instruments becomes favourable assets or unfavourable liabilities as a result of fluctuations in market interest rates, indices, foreign exchange rates and other relevant variables relative to their terms.
The aggregate contractual amount of derivative financial instruments held, the extent to which instruments are favourable or unfavourable, and thus the aggregate fair values of derivative financial assets and liabilities, can fluctuate significantly from time to time.
The fair values are set out below: 2011 2010 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Interest rate contracts 3.0 6.6 3.5 6.3 Forward foreign exchange contracts 24.1 17.9 27.9 24.7 Equity contracts 18.4 18.9 17.3 19.4 45.5 43.4 48.7 50.4 2011 2010 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m 1 2 Net-settled derivative contracts maturing repricing in: Less than 1 year 9.6 10.1 5.2 7.1 1 3 years 9.2 9.4 12.9 12.9 3 5 years 0.9 5.7 0.6 4.0 More than 5 years 1.7 0.3 2.1 1.7 21.4 25.5 20.8 25.7 3 2 Gross-settled derivatives maturing repricing in: Less than 1 year: Gross inflows 769.3 160.4 871.2 945.8 Gross outflows 765.6 162.6 870.9 948.0 Difference between future contractual cash flows and fair value 20.4 15.7 26.1 20.9 24.1 17.9 26.4 23.1 1 2 years: Gross inflows 29.7 29.7 Gross outflows 29.7 29.8 Difference between future contractual cash flows and fair value 1.5 1.5 1.5 1.6 45.5 43.4 48.7 50.4 1 Comprise interest rate and equity contracts.

Share premium substantially represents the aggregate of all amounts that have ever been paid above par value to Schroders plc when it has issued ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares, although there are certain circumstances in which the share premium can be reduced.
Such circumstances have not arisen in 2011 or 2010.
The Company has no authority to issue or cancel the number of ordinary shares in issue including those held in trust and has authority limited by shareholder resolution to issue and purchase non-voting ordinary shares, which may either be cancelled or held in treasury.

There are two main reasons why this may happen: first, it enables the Group to meet share-based remuneration awards to employees in the form of shares see note 27 in a way that does not dilute the holdings of existing shareholders.
Second, the Group may wish to hold some of its shares in treasury to settle option exercises or for other permitted purposes.
The purchase of its own shares reduces the Groups net assets by the amount spent.
Own shares include the Groups shares both ordinary and non-voting ordinary that are held by employee trusts or in treasury.
Own shares are recorded at cost.
When shares vest unconditionally or are cancelled they are transferred from own shares to the profit and loss reserve at their weighted average cost.

26 Retirement benefit obligations The Group has two types of pension benefit for employees: defined benefit DB where the Group has an obligation to provideparticipating employees with pension payments that represent a specified percentage of their final salary, and defined contribution DC, where the Groups contribution to an employees pension is measured as, and limited to, a specified percentage of salary.
Accounting for DB schemes requires an assessment of the likely quantum of future pension payments to be made.
If ringfenced assets are held specifically to meet this cost, the scheme is funded, if not, it is unfunded.
The Group periodically reviews, using actuarial specialists, its funded DB scheme to assess whether it is on course to meet the expected pension payments that current and former employees are or will be entitled to.
In the case of a projected shortfall, a plan must be formulated to eradicate the deficit.
The income statement charge or credit represents the sum of pension entitlements earned by employees in the period, plus an allowance for the time value of money less gains expected to be made on the ring-fenced assets.
Experience differences, principally the difference between actual and expected investment returns as well as actuarial changes in estimating the present value of future liabilities, are recorded in other comprehensive income.
Assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position represent the differences between the fair value of plan assets if any and the actuarially determined estimates of the present value of future liabilities.
The Group closed its largest DB scheme to future accrual on 30 April 2011, although it still operates some small unfunded schemes for overseas businesses.
This means that no future service will contribute to the closed scheme member benefits but those members continue to have the benefits determined by the Scheme Rules as at 30 April 2011.
As a result of the closure to future accrual, a curtailment gain was recorded, being the actuarially determined estimate of the present value of the funding cost which will no longer be incurred by the Group.
This arises from previously anticipated salary increases of members in excess of CPI inflation between 1 May 2011 and retirement from the Group that would have been an assumption in the determination of pension payments.
The Groups exposure to funding DC pension schemes is limited to the contributions it has agreed to make.
These contributions generally stop when employment ceases.
The income statement charge represents the contributions the Group has agreed to make into employees pension schemes in that period.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world.
For DC schemes, pension contributions payable in respect of theaccounting period are charged as Operating expenses in the income statement.
DB obligations are recorded at the present value ofthe DB obligations at the year-end date less the fair value at the year-end date of the Scheme assets plan assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
The difference between the fair value of the plan assets if any and the present value of the DB obligations at the year-end date, together with adjustments for unvested past service cost, is recognised as an asset or liability, as appropriate, in the statement of financial position.
An asset arising, for example, as a result of past over-funding or the performance of the plan investments, is recognised to the extent that it is recoverable.
Plan assets are valued on a bid basis.

The Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual on 30 April 2011.
At 31 December 2011 there were no active members in the Scheme and 1,238 active members in the DC section 2010: 284 and 849 respectively.
The last completed triennial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2008.
It disclosed that the market value of the assets of the Scheme represented 92 per cent.

The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2011 is currently in progress.
In the year, the contributions to the Scheme totalled 3.1 million 2010: 62.2 million.
The Group paid effective contributions to 30 April 2011 of 37.5 per cent.
of pensionable salaries to cover the accrual of ongoing benefits.
For joiners on or after 1 June 1989, pensionable salaries for this purpose were subject to the statutory earnings cap which was in force until April 2006, after which this cap was replaced by a notional earnings cap.
The income statement credit for the Scheme has been determined by independent qualified actuaries, Aon Hewitt Limited, and is based onan assessment of the Scheme as at 31 December 2011.

indd 128 13 03 2012 17:17 Overview Strategy Business review Governance Financial report Shareholder information 129 Financial report Notes to the accounts 26 Retirement benefit obligations continued Estimates and judgements The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The assumptions used in determining the net credit for pension costs include the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets and the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
The expected return on plan assets assumption is determined on a uniform basis, taking into consideration long-term historical returns, asset allocation and future estimates of long-term investment returns.
The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year.
This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality long-dated corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid.
Assumptions made on expected mortality rates are inherently uncertain.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables with Continuous Mortality Investigation core projection factors and a long-term rate of mortality improvement of 1.5 per cent.
Mortality tables for female pensioners are scaled back by 15 per cent.
to reflect the history of life expectancy ofthe Groups employees.
The Group reviews its assumptions annually in conjunction with its independent actuaries and considers this adjustment appropriate given the geographic and demographic profile of Scheme members.
Other assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.

indd 129 13 03 2012 01:33 130 Financial report Notes to the accounts 27 Share-based payments Share-based payments are remuneration payments to selected employees that take the form of an award of shares in Schroders plc.
Such awards constituted 9.4 per cent.
of salaries and other remuneration.
Employees aregenerally not able to exercise such awards until three years after the award has been made.
Accounting for share-based awards differs from accounting for awards made in cash.
The charge for equity-settled share-based payments is determined based on the fair value of the award on the grant date.
Such awards can include share options or share awards which may or may not have performance criteria.
The initial fair value of the award takes into account the current value of shares expected to be issued i. e. estimates of the likely levels of forfeiture and achievement of performance criteria, the contribution, if required, by the employee, and the time value of money.
This fair value is charged to the income statement reflecting the benefits received from employment in the year preceding grant and the period to vesting.
The income statement charge is offset by a credit to the statement of changes in equity.
The Group may make share-based payments to key employees through awards over or linked to the value of ordinary and non-voting ordinary shares and by the grant of market value share options over ordinary or non-voting ordinary shares.
It is our practice to hedge all equity-settled awards to eliminate the impact of changes in the market value of shares.
Awards that lapse or are forfeited result in a credit to the income statement reversing the previous charge in the year in which they lapse or are forfeited.
The Group recognised total expenses of 42.5 million 2010: 38.7 million arising from share-based payment transactions during the year of which 42.7 million 2010: 34.2 million were equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

For the 2000 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant, discounted for the dividends forgone over the average holding period of the award.
For the 2011 Equity Compensation Plan the fair value of an award is calculated using the market value of the shares on the date of grant.
