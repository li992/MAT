Share-based payments Group and Parent Company The Group has established a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, which granted options in April 2003, September 2004, September 2005, September 2006, April 2008, September 2009 and April 2011, and an Executive Share Option Scheme, which granted options in September 2003, March 2004, August 2004, September 2004, August 2006, April 2008, April 2009 and August 2011.
Both of these schemes also made grants of options prior to 7 November 2002.
The recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have not been applied to these grants in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1 and IFRS 2.
The Company established a Long Term Incentive Plan in 2006 and grants of options have been made under this scheme in March 2007, March 2008 and August 2008.
The Company established a Performance Share Plan in 2009 and grants of options have been made under this scheme in April 2010 and March 2011.

The options exercised during the year had a weighted average market value of 5.25 2010: 4.74.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on the Black-Scholes model.
The contractual life of the option is used as an input into this model.

The historical volatility is calculated using a weekly rolling share price for the three year period immediately prior to the option grant date.
Share options are granted under a service condition and, for grants to senior employees, a non-market performance condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants.

Included within the provision is 199,000 in respect of possible recourse on leases transferred to the purchaser on the sale of the Belgian operation.
Provisions reversed during the year relate to leases which have been successfully exited on more favourable terms than previously anticipated.
The key area of uncertainty relates to the net future rental costs to be incurred on vacated properties and, in particular, whether the properties can be sublet until lease exit.
The provision assumes that subletting is unlikely in the current climate.
For shops, the provision is expected to be substantially utilised within three years such, that the impact of discounting would not be material.
For bakeries, the period over which the provision will be utilised is less certain and the provision is discounted over an appropriate period.

The Trust, which was established during 1988 to act as a repository of issued Company shares, holds 1,929,034 shares 2010: 2,677,620 shares with a market value at 31 December 2011 of 9,861,000 2010: 12,451,000 which have not vested unconditionally in employees.
The shares held by the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust can be purchased either by employees on the exercise of an option under the Greggs Executive Share Option Schemes, Greggs Savings Related Share Option Schemes and Greggs Performance Share Plan or by the trustees of the Greggs Employee Share Scheme.
The trustees have elected to waive the dividends payable on these shares.

Capital and reserves continued The proposed final dividend in respect of 2011 amounts to 13.5 pence per share 13,656,000.
This proposed dividend is subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these accounts.
Operating leases Non-cancellable operating lease rentals are payable as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Less than one year 39,076 37,047 Between one and five years 97,089 100,655 More than five years 26,060 28,229 162,225 165,931 The Group leases the majority of its shops under operating leases.
The leases typically run for a period of ten years, with an option to renew the lease after that date.
Lease payments are generally increased every five years to reflect market rentals.
For a small number of the leases the rental is contingent on the level of turnover achieved in the relevant unit.
The inception of the shop leases has taken place over a long period of time and many date back a significant number of years.
They are combined leases of land and buildings.
It is not possible to obtain a reliable estimate of the split of the fair values of the lease interest between land and buildings at inception.
Therefore, in determining lease classification, the Group evaluated whether both parts are clearly an operating lease or a finance lease.
Firstly, title does not pass for the land or building.
Secondly, because the rent paid to the landlord for the buildings is increased to market rent at regular intervals, and the Group does not participate in the residual value of the land or building it is judged that substantially all the risks and rewards of the land and building are with the landlord.
Based on these qualitative factors it is concluded that the leases are operating leases.
