An amount of $8.0 million previously and provisionally recognised as goodwill was re-allocated to other intangible assets.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying value of goodwill relates to Elementis Specialty Products $301.4 million and Elementis Surfactants $3.4 million.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
In order to stress test the results over a wider range of conditions, management has expanded its testing to include discount rates based on a variety of equity risk premiums and different capital structures that reflect the potential variability of risk within the CGUs and the Groups long term financing options.
The result of this exercise was a range of discount rates from 9.0 per cent, calculated on a basis broadly consistent with 2010 discount rate of 10.6 per cent to 11.8 per cent.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent three year plans approved by management for the next three years and extrapolates cash flows for the following 17 years based on estimated growth rates of 0 to 2.5 per cent.
The rates do not exceed the average long term growth rate for the relevant markets and also take into account potential, future capacity limitations for the Chromium business.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The results of the impairment testing using the assumptions discussed show that there is no indication that goodwill might be impaired.
The brand intangible represents the value ascribed to the trading name and reputation of the recent Deuchem and Fancor acquisitions.
The Group considers these to have significant and ongoing value to the business that will be maintained and it is therefore considered appropriate to assign these assets an indefinite useful life.
The remaining intangible assets comprise of the value ascribed to customer lists, patents and non-compete clauses, which are being amortised over periods of five to ten years.
Other intangible assets comprise mainly of the value ascribed to the brand and customer lists acquired as part of the Deuchem acquisition.
The customer list is being amortised over a useful economic life of ten years.

These relate to restricted losses within the UK and have reduced in the year due to the restructuring within subsidiaries.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Where this is not the case, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.

The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Groups Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
The Groups Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit.
Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, the results of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 ELEMENTIS PLC shareholder 92 93 finanCial 50 91 Corporate 26 49 business 02 25 Company ifC 01 information statements governanCe review overview 70 notes to the Consolidated finanCial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 21 FinAnciAl risk mAnAgement continueD Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The demographics of the Groups customer base, including the default risk of the industry and country in which customers operate, has less of an influence on credit risk.
No single customer accounts for a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and geographically there is no concentration of credit risk.
Each new customer is analysed individually for creditworthiness before the Groups standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered.
The Groups review includes external ratings, where available, and in some cases bank references.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which represents the maximum open amount without requiring approval from the Board.
Customers that fail to meet the Groups benchmark creditworthiness may transact with the Group only on a prepayment basis.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables.
The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significant exposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have been incurred but not yet identified.
The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similar assets.
Investments The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through a treasury policy that imposes graduated limits on the amount of funds that can be deposited with counterparties by reference to the counterparties credit ratings, as defined by Standard & Poors or Moodys.
Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups funding policy is to have committed borrowings in place to cover at least 125 per cent of the maximum forecast net borrowings for the next 12 month period.
At the year end the Group had $201.9 million 2010: $105.9 million of undrawn committed facilities, of which $190.0 million expires after more than one year.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimising the return on risk.
The Group uses derivatives in the ordinary course of business, and also incurs financial liabilities, in order to manage market risks.
All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a foreign currency other than the respective functional currencies of Group entities, primarily the US Dollar and the Euro.
The Group hedges up to 100 per cent of current and forecast trade receivables and trade payables denominated in a foreign currency.
The Group uses forward exchange contracts to hedge its currency risk, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date.
Interest on borrowings is denominated in currencies that match the cash flows generated by the underlying operations of the Group, primarily US Dollar, but also Euro and GBP.
This provides an economic hedge and no derivatives are entered into.
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rates when necessary to address short term imbalances.
The Groups investment in overseas subsidiaries is hedged by US Dollar denominated drawdowns under the syndicated facility, which mitigates the currency risk arising from the translation of a subsidiarys net assets.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy is to borrow at both fixed and floating interest rates and to use interest rate swaps to generate the required interest profile.
The policy does not require that a specific proportion of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rates of interest.
Other market price risk Equity price risk arises from available-for-sale equity securities held within the Groups defined benefit pension.
In respect of the US schemes, management monitors the mix of debt and equity securities in its investment portfolio based on market expectations.
The primary goal of the Groups investment strategy in respect of the US schemes, is to maximise investment returns, without excessive risk taking, in order to meet partially the Groups unfunded benefit obligation and management is assisted by external advisers in this regard.
In respect of the UK scheme, the investment strategy is set by the trustees and the Board is kept informed.
The Group does not enter into commodity contracts other than to meet the Groups expected usage and sale requirements: such contracts are not settled net.
ELEMENTIS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 71 Capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board monitors the return on operating capital employed including goodwill, as defined on page 15.
The Groups target is to achieve a ROCE including goodwill in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
The Board encourages employees to hold shares in the Company through the Groups savings related share option schemes.
At present, employees, including executive directors hold 0.3 per cent 2010: 0.2 per cent of ordinary shares, or 3.5 per cent 2010: 3.9 per cent assuming that all outstanding options vest or are exercised.

Basis for determining fair values The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using significant unobservable inputs.

The following summarises the significant methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the table above.
Derivatives level 1 The fair value of forward exchange contracts is based on their listed market price, if available.
If a listed market price is not available, then fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest based on government bonds.
Non-derivatives financial liabilities level 2 Fair value is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Trade and other receivables level 3 The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.
Interest rates used for determining fair value The interest rates used to discount estimated cash flows, where applicable, are based on the government yield curve at the reporting date plus an adequate constant credit spread and were as follows: 2011 2010 per cent per cent Derivatives 4.1 7.1 4.1 Borrowings 2.6 2.9 2.4 3.8 22 operAting leAses 2011 2010 $million $million Minimum lease payments under operating leases recognised as an expense in the year 4.5 3.9 ELEMENTIS PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 77 At the balance sheet date, the Group has outstanding commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2011 2010 $million $million Within one year 1.9 2.4 In the second to fifth years inclusive 1.0 7.5 After five years 24.9 22.4 27.8 32.3 Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group for certain of its properties, plant and machinery.
Leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
23 retirement beneFit obligAtions The Group has a number of contributory and non-contributory post retirement benefit plans providing retirement benefits for the majority of employees and executive directors.
The main schemes in the UK, US and Netherlands are of the defined benefit type, the benefit being based on number of years of service and either the employees final remuneration or the employees average remuneration during a period of years before retirement.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds or are unfunded but provided for on the Group balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates an unfunded post retirement medical benefit PRMB scheme in the US.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum service period.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out on 30 September 2008 for the UK scheme and at 31 December 2011 for the US and Netherlands schemes.
The UK actuarial valuation has been updated to 31 December 2011 for inclusion within this Annual Report.

A Long Term Incentive Plan was adopted in 2008 amended in 2010 2010 LTIP for selected senior executives then including the executive directors and business presidents.
Details about this scheme can be found in the Report of the Remuneration Committee.
For other executives, the Company operates an approved and unapproved executive share option scheme, which was adopted in 2003 2003 ESOS.
This scheme expires next year and accordingly the Board is proposing a new discretionary executive share option scheme to replace the 2003 ESOS at this years Annual General Meeting.
Further details are enclosed in the Notice of Meeting accompanying this Annual Report.
Participants of the 2010 LTIP will not also participate in the 2003 ESOS and vice versa.
Under the 2003 ESOS, options are granted to purchase shares in the Company at an exercise price per share based on the Companys mid market closing share price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant with no discount applied.
Under the 2010 LTIP, nil cost options are granted i. e. options having no exercise price.
In both cases, the number of options that are granted are based on a percentage of the participants basic salary.
Options under both schemes are capable of exercise after three years, subject to earnings per share and total shareholder return performance targets being met, and within ten years of the date of the grant.
The maximum individual award under both schemes is generally limited to 150 per cent of basic salary.
The Company also operates a 2008 UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme under which UK employees can enter into savings contracts with a bank or building society for a period of three or five years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the average mid market price over the five working days preceding the invitation date discounted by 20 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within six months following the end of the savings period.
A similar scheme exists for US employees.
Under the 2008 US Sharesave Scheme, US employees can enter into savings contracts with a bank for a period of two years and use the proceeds from their savings accounts to purchase shares in the Company on the exercise of their options.
The option price is the mid market price on the date of the grant discounted by 15 per cent.
Options may be exercised typically within three months following the end of the savings period.
Options were valued as shown in the table below using the binomial option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculations are as follows: 2011 2010 Fair value per option pence 93.5 34.6 Expected volatility per cent 53.0 58.0 Risk free rate per cent 2.1 2.5 Expected dividend yield per cent 2.0 4.4 Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous five years.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of $2.5 million 2010: $1.4 million related to share based payment transactions during the year which includes awards made under the Long Term Incentive Plan as amended in 2010 as shown in the table opposite.
The table overleaf shows all outstanding options granted under the 2010 LTIP and the executive and savings-related share option schemes.
In addition to the above expenses, the Company incurred a further IFRS 2 expense of $0.2 million 2010: $0.5 million in respect of the grant of awards made under the LTIP in 2008, which vested during 2011.
The binomial method was used to value these awards.
Under IFRS 2 rules, the fair value charge is calculated in the year the awards were first made and then pro rated over the following three to four financial years.
The expense in 2011 represents 4 36ths of the total IFRS 2 charge for these awards.
Owing to the nature of the awards, participants were entitled to a share of a pool which meant the actual number of shares to which they were entitled to on vesting could not be determined until the date of vesting 28 April 2011 and after the performance condition had been tested.
The number of shares that did vest under these awards was 2,946,687.
These awards are not included in the table of options awards overleaf or in the calculation of the weighted average exercise price during 2011 in order to provide consistency.
These shadow options have not previously been disclosed in the table above due to materiality, but were included in the calculation of the total expenses recognised by the Group related to share based payments.

A provision is recognised when the Group believes it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where it is deemed that an obligation is merely possible and that the probability of a material outflow is not remote, the Group would disclose a contingent liability.
Elementis LTP Inc LTP has been named as a defendant in chromium related litigation currently pending in the State of Missouri the Missouri Litigation.
The Missouri Litigation developed into the following types of cases: 1 15 cases involving over 180 individual plaintiffs alleging property and or personal injury: 2 a class action seeking property damages for an unspecified number of putative class members: and 3 a class action seeking medical monitoring damages for putative class members who live in a four county area.
Between December 2010 and November 2011, five of the individual plaintiff cases described in clause 1 above involving approximately 133 individual plaintiffs and the medical monitoring class action described in clause 3 above were voluntarily dismissed.
In late December 2011 and early January 2012, LTP secured two orders for summary judgement in its favour by judges in two separate cases.
The first was in respect of all of the plaintiffs claims in one of the cases involving 26 individual plaintiffs described in clause 1 above, and the second concerned the property damage class action described in clause 2 above.
In January 2012 following these two orders, five more of the cases described in clause 1 above involving approximately 17 individual plaintiffs were voluntarily dismissed.
In the four cases involving approximately five individual plaintiffs that remain described in clause 1 above, the plaintiffs claim personal injury due to alleged exposure to a chromium compound as the result of processes utilised by a tannery in St. Joseph, Missouri that was owned by Prime Tanning, Corp. Prime Tanning.
LTP has been named as the procurer of sodium dichromate for another defendant, Wismo Chemical Corp. Wismo.
Wismo was located onsite at the tannery and was in the business of converting sodium dichromate upon delivery by LTP into chromium sulphate a chemical agent that is commonly used in the tanning of hides.
Wismo, in turn, sold the chromium sulphate to Prime Tanning.
50 per cent of the shares of Wismo had been owned by LTP, its affiliates or its predecessors, but such shares were sold to Prime Tanning prior to LTP being named as a defendant in the Missouri Litigation proceedings.
Management, after consultation with legal counsel, has concluded that the proceedings are unlikely to be adversely determined against LTP and thus would not reasonably be expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
None of the remaining proceedings is scheduled to go to trial before the beginning of 2013.
