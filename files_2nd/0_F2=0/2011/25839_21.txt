Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments and derivative financial instruments at fair value.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which are quoted bid market prices for investments traded in active markets.
Changes in the value of investments held at fair value through profit or loss and gains and losses on sales are included in the capital column of the Income Statement within Gains losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
Gains and losses on sales of investments, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses are dealt with in capital reserves within Investment holding gains and losses.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
Stocklending income is taken to revenue on a receipts basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue except for expenses incidental to purchases and sales of investments which are written off to capital.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs can be found in note 10 on page 42. e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.

Accounting policies continued f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Derivative financial instruments, including short term forward currency contracts, are valued at fair value, which is the net unrealised gain or loss, and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Bank loans are classified as loans and receivables and are measured at amortised cost.
They are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction or, in the case of forward currency contracts, at contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end, or at the related forward currency contract rate.
Any gain or loss on monetary assets arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
h Taxation Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value Added Tax VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
VAT recoverable is calculated using the partial exemption method based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
j Repurchase of shares to hold in Treasury The cost of repurchasing shares into Treasury, including the related stamp duty and transaction costs is charged to capital reserves and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
Where shares held in Treasury are subsequently cancelled, the nominal value of those shares is transferred out of called up share capital and into capital redemption reserve.
Should shares held in Treasury be reissued, the sales proceeds will be treated as a realised profit up to the amount of the purchase price of those shares and will be transferred to capital reserves.
The excess of the sales proceeds over the purchase price will be transferred to share premium.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge for the year 2011 2010 000 000 UK corporation tax at28% 2010: 28% Overseas withholding tax 606 775 Current tax charge for the year 606 775 b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is lower 2010: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2011 2010 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation 2,975 77,377 80,352 2,942 152,217 155,159 Net return on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of28% 2010: 28% 833 21,666 22,499 824 42,621 43,445 Effects of: Non taxable capital gains 21,666 21,666 42,621 42,621 Non taxable overseas dividends 2,061 2,061 771 771 Income taxed in different periods 1 1 240 240 Overseas taxation 606 606 775 775 Unrelieved expenses and charges 1,227 1,227 333 333 Brought forward expenses and charges utilised 626 626 606 606 775 775 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 6,180,000 2010: 5,182,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 27%.
The Finance Act 2010, which provides for a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% effective from 1st April 2011, was substantively enacted on 21st July 2010.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% each year down to 24% by 1st April 2014.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an investment trust company, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred taxation on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 29 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.
The Companys liabilities are not held at fair value.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: Level 1valued using quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1.
Level 3valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 37.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term in order to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close co-operation with the Board and the Manager, co-ordinates the Companys risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments comprise the following: investments in equity shares of European companies and a Euro liquidity fund which are both held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: short term forward currency contracts for the purpose of settling short term liabilities: and loan facilities, the purpose of which are to finance the Companys operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least five occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the sterling value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing is limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st March are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2009: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the Euro, Danish krone, Norwegian krone, Swedish krona, Swiss francs and the other currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.

ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings are used when required.
The Company may finance part of its activities through borrowings at levels approved and monitored by the Board.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on the loan facilities.
However, amounts drawn down on these facilities are for short term periods and therefore there is limited exposure to interest rate risk.
Derivatives are not used to hedge against the exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest rate exposure The Company has no financial assets or liabilities carrying fixed rates of interest.
The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates using the year end figures, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.

The target interest earned on the JPM Euro Liquidity Fund is the 7 day Euro London Interbank Bid Rate.
In January 2011, the Company arranged a Euro 55 million 1 year Floating Rate Loan Facility with ING Bank.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company may draw down up to Euro 55 million, or its sterling or US dollar equivalent, at an interest rate of LIBOR as offered in the market for the relevant currency and loan period, plus a margin of 1.25% per annum plus the Mandatory Cost Rate, which is the lenders cost of complying with the regulatory requirements of the European Central Bank during the term of the advance.
At the year end, the Company had drawn down the whole Euro 55 million on this facility at a weighted average interest rate of 2.31%.
In January 2011, the Company also arranged a Euro 55 million 1 year Floating Rate Loan Facility with Scotiabank.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company may draw down up to Euro 55 million, or its sterling or US dollar equivalent, at an interest rate of LIBOR as offered in the market for the relevant currency and loan period, plus a margin of 1.25% per annum plus the Mandatory Cost Rate.
At the year end, the Company had drawn down Euro 40 million on this facility at an interest rate of 2.30%.
At 31st March 2010, the Company had drawn down Euro 15 million on a facility similar to the above, which expired during the year.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 1% 2010: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of market price risk The Board meets on at least five occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Market price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 31st March comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 557,047 416,678 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to market price risk during the year.
Concentration of exposure to market price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 13 to 17.
This shows that nearly all of the investments value is in European companies and there is no concentration of exposure to any one country.
It should also be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2010: 10% in the fair value of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, the liquidity of which in normal markets is frequently tested by the Investment Managers and which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
All of the Companys assets are considered to be realisable within one month.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is for the Company to remain fully invested in normal market conditions and that short term borrowings be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Details of the current loan facilities are given in part a ii to this note on page 50.
Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2011 2010 Three Not more Three Not more months than one months than one or less year Total or less year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 15,230 15,230 13,549 13,549 Bank loans 70,824 70,824 13,380 13,380 Purchase of shares into Treasury awaiting settlement 1,040 1,040 Bank overdraft 421 421 Other creditors and accruals 410 410 168 168 16,061 70,824 86,885 14,757 13,380 28,137 c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate Delivery Versus Payment DVP settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager continuously monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase The Companys assets are ring-fenced in client designated accounts.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.

The aggregate value of securities on loan at 31st March 2011 amounted to 21.1 million and the maximum value of stock on loan during the year amounted to 46.4 million.
Collateral is obtained by JPMorgan Asset Management and is called in on a daily basis to a value of 102% of the value of the securities on loan if that collateral is denominated in the same currency as the securities on loan and 105% if it is denominated in a different currency.
Collateral acceptable under the Stock Lending Agreement may comprise cash in sterling, euros, or US dollars, Eurozone government securities, UK government securities and US government securities.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying amount in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value.
Capital management policies and procedures The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 80% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding holdings in liquidity funds, expressed as a percentage of net assets.
At 31st March 2011, gearing calculated on this basis was 116.7% 2010: 100.2%.
The Companys capital comprises the following: 2011 2010 000 000 Debt Bank loans falling due within one year 70,824 13,380 Equity Equity share capital 10,877 11,771 Reserves 466,551 404,111 Total equity 477,428 415,882 Total capital 548,252 429,262 The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: and the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury.
