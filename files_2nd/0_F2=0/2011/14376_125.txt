Accounts and other information of related claims have been led, most of which have been settled.
The aggregate cost at 31 December 2011 related to this matter is approximately $214m.
The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims.
The primary insurance carrier has paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability.
However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the insurance policies and other matters.
In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, and trial is expected to commence in 2013.
An additional $22m was received from a successful settlement with a third party.
A charge of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims.
Most of that amount has since been applied to settlements of such claims.
Management believes that the $17m provision remaining is adequate to cover remaining claims.
Given the uncertainty inherent in such matters, there can be no assurance on this point.
The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and, in some cases, breach of licence agreement.
These disputes are being heard in courts in the United States and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine patents.
Outcomes are rarely certain with costs and settlements often significant.
19 Retirement benefit obligations Accounting policy The Groups major pension plans are of the dened benefit type.
For these plans, the employers portion of past and current service cost is charged to operating profit, with the interest cost net of expected return on assets in the plans reported within other finance income costs.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full directly in other comprehensive income such that the balance sheet reects the plans surpluses or deficits as at the balance sheet date.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash ows using interest rates that reference high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benets will be paid and have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
A number of key assumptions have to be made in calculating the fair value of the Groups dened benefit pension plans.
These assumptions impact the balance sheet assets and liabilities, operating profit and finance income costs.
The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of ination and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities.
The most important assumption for the plan assets is the future expected return.
In determining these assumptions management takes into account the advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
Where dened contribution plans operate, the contributions to these plans are charged to operating profit as they become payable.

The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countries in which it has major operating companies.
Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant country.
Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In those countries where there is no company-sponsored pension plan, state benets are considered adequate.
Employees retirement benets are the subject of regular management review.
The Groups major dened benefit pension plans in the UK and US were closed to new employees in 2003 and replaced by dened contribution plans.
Dened benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement benets varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age.
The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of service of the employee.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation and the related current service cost are measured using the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the dened benefit plans approach retirement.

19.8 Retirement healthcare The cost of providing healthcare benets after retirement is determined by independent actuaries.
The principal actuarial assumptions in determining the cost of providing healthcare benets are those in the UK and the US and are as follows: 2011 2010 2009 % per annum UK US UK US UK US Discount rate 4.9 4.6 5.5 5.6 5.7 6.0 Medical cost ination 7.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 7.0 8.0 A one percentage point change in the rate of medical cost ination would not affect the accumulated retirement benefit obligations, or the aggregate of the current service and interest costs, of the UK or US plans in 2011 by more than $2m 2010 more than $2m, 2009 more than $2m.
For the US the retirement healthcare cost trend for 2012 is expected to be 3.4% above the discount rate.
Thereafter the healthcare cost trend rate is assumed to decrease by 0.5% per year to an ultimate rate of 5%.
For the UK it will remain at at 7%.
