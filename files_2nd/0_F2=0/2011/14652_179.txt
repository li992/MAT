Business combinations On 16 February 2011 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of the Fanfare Group, Inc.
Fanfare for a total consideration of $14.5 million in cash.
Fanfare provides test automation solutions that help equipment manufacturers and service providers accelerate time to market and improve product quality in the face of rapidly growing complexity.
Convergence, in multiple forms, is driving growth in the complexity and scale required for successful testing of IP and Ethernet devices, networks and services, creating a clear need to streamline the product and services development process.
An integrated and collaborative test automation approach is becoming an increasingly important business requirement to innovate in this market.
Combining the two companies products and services results in a common automated test experience and a common platform that brings together engineers, technologies and processes.
From the date of acquisition to 31 December 2011, Fanfare contributed $6.4 million of revenue and $0.8 million of profit before tax to the results of the Group before charging $1.2 million of acquisition related costs and $1.2 million of acquired intangible asset amortisation.
If the combination had occurred at the beginning of the financial year additional revenue of $1.4 million and a loss before tax of $0.4 million would have been included in the Group result before bonus payments made by the vendor prior to the sale of the business of $1.2 million.
The goodwill arising of $4.2 million consists largely of the synergies and economies of scale expected from the combination of the entities together with intangible assets not qualifying for separate recognition such as workforce in place.
None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
