63 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated accounts Significant accounting policies Greggs plc the Company is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group accounts consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The Parent Company accounts present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The accounts were authorised for issue by the directors on 14 March 2012. a Statement of compliance Both the Parent Company accounts and the Group accounts have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU adopted IFRSs, IFRIC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
On publishing the Parent Company accounts here together with the Group accounts, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes that form a part of these approved accounts.
b Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand, and are prepared on the historical cost basis except the defined benefit pension liability, which is recognised as plan assets less the present value of the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the directors report and business review on pages 4 to 39.
The financial position of the Group, its cashflows and liquidity are described in the Financial Review on pages 11 and 12.
In addition note 2 to the accounts includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial resources and the business continues to be strongly cash generative.
As a consequence, the directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risk successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the annual report and accounts.
The Group chose not to restate business combinations prior to the IFRS transition date 1 January 2004, as no significant acquisitions had taken place during the previous ten years.
The Groups policy up to and including 1997 was to eliminate goodwill arising upon acquisitions against reserves.
Under IFRS 1 and IFRS 3, such goodwill remains eliminated against reserves.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently throughout the Group and to all years presented in these consolidated accounts and are unchanged from previous years.
From 2 January 2011 the following standards, amendments and interpretations became effective and were adopted by the Group: Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosure Improvements to IFRSs IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Amendments to IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation: Classification of Rights Issues Amendment to IAS 39 Reclassification of Financial Assets: Effective Date and Transition Amendments to IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions The adoption of the above has not had a significant impact on the Groups profit for the year or equity.
64 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of preparation continued The preparation of financial information in conformity with adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that year, or in the year of revision and future years if the revision affects both current and future years.
The key estimates and judgements that have the most significant impact on the accounts are as follows: Lease classification Judgement has to be applied as to whether the Groups shop leases are operating leases or finance leases see note 23 for how this is determined.
Post-retirement benefits The determination of the defined benefit obligation of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme depends on the selection of certain assumptions including the discount rate, inflation rate, mortality rates and expected return on scheme assets.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reflected in future years.
The key assumptions made for 2011 are given in note 20.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
For example, bakery equipment may be impaired if it is no longer in use and or shop fittings may be impaired if sales in that shop fall.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations which include managements estimates of future cashflows generated by the assets and an appropriate discount rate.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment Depreciation is provided so as to write down the assets to the residual values over their estimated useful lives, both of which require managements judgement see accounting policy g. Provisions Provision is required in respect of vacated properties and properties which the Group has committed to vacate and for which the Group has ongoing lease commitments.
Management exercise judgement as to whether the property will be sublet to a third party taking into account current market conditions and, if so, for how long and at what rent, in order to estimate the future net holding cost to the Group until the lease can be exited.
This estimate is then discounted where the impact would be material at a rate that reflects the current time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
In respect of our exit from the Belgian operation in 2008 a provision remains for the potential recourse of leases taken over by the new owner.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Greggs plc and its subsidiary undertakings for the 52 weeks ended 31 December 2011.
The comparative period is the 52 weeks ended 1 January 2011. i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists where the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date control commences until the date that control ceases.
65 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Significant accounting policies continued ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated accounts.
d Exceptional items Exceptional items are defined as items of income and expenditure which are material and unusual in nature and which are considered to be of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement in accordance with IAS 1. e Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
f Intangible assets The Groups only intangible asset is accounting software which is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Amortisation is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use.
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are five years.
g Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy k. The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
ii Subsequent costs The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group, and its costs can be measured reliably.
The carrying value of the replaced component is derecognised.
The costs of the day-to-day servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
66 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Significant accounting policies continued g Property, plant and equipment continued iii Depreciation Depreciation is provided so as to write off the cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment during its expected useful life using the straight line method over the following periods: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 40 years Short leasehold properties 10 years or length of lease if shorter Plant, machinery, equipment, vehicles, fixtures and fittings 3 to 10 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values if not insignificant are reassessed annually.
iv Assets in the course of construction Depreciation on these assets commences when the assets are available for use.
h Investments Non-current investments comprise investments in subsidiaries which are carried at cost less impairment.
Current investments comprise fixed-term, fixed-rate bank deposits where the term is greater than three months.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and direct production labour costs.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cashflows.
67 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Significant accounting policies continued k Impairment The carrying amounts of the Group and Companys assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
Impairment reviews are carried out on an individual shop basis unless there are a number of shops in the same location, in which case the impairment review is based on the location.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in prior years are assessed at each reporting date and reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
l Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets are remeasured in accordance with the Group and Companys accounting policies.
Thereafter generally the assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
m Share capital i Repurchase of share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares that are held in the Employee Share Ownership Plan are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
ii Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the year in which they are approved by the shareholders.
n Employee share ownership plan The Group and Parent Company accounts include the assets and related liabilities of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust EBT.
In both the Group and Parent Company accounts the shares held by the EBT are stated at cost and deducted from total equity.
o Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement when they are due.
ii Defined benefit plans The Group and Companys obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension plans, is calculated by estimating the amount of the future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years.
That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and any unrecognised past service costs, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA credit rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
68 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Significant accounting policies continued o Employee benefits continued When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group and Company recognise actuarial gains and losses in full, in the year in which they occur, in the statement of changes in equity.
iii Sharebased payment transactions The share option programme allows Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of share options granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date, using an appropriate model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the share options were granted, and is spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
For options granted before 7 November 2002 the recognition and measurement principles of IFRS 2 have not been applied in accordance with the transitional provisions in IFRS 1.
In addition deferred taxation has not been recognised on these options but is accounted for as current tax when it arises.
p Provisions A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
i Restructuring A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating costs are not provided for.
ii Vacant properties Provision is made for vacant and partly sublet properties for the shorter of the remaining period of the lease and the period until, in the directors opinion, they will be able to exit the lease commitment.
Significant assumptions are applied in making these calculations and such provisions are assessed by reference to the best available information at the balance sheet date.
q Revenue i Goods sold Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised as income on receipt of cash and is stated after deduction of discounts, promotions and value-added taxation.
r Government grants Government grants are recognised in the balance sheet initially as deferred income when there is a reasonable assurance that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions attaching to them.
Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis in the same periods in which the expenses are incurred.
Grants that compensate the Group for the cost of an asset are recognised in the income statement over the useful life of the asset.
69 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Significant accounting policies continued s Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense over the term of the lease.
t Finance income and expenses i Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable on cash balances and foreign exchange movements relating to overseas bank accounts.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest method.
ii Finance expenses Finance expenses comprise interest payable on borrowings and related foreign exchange movements on any Euro bank borrowings.
u Income tax Income tax comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax recognised is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related deferred tax benefit will be realised.
v Research and development The Company continuously strives to improve its products and processes through technical and other innovation.
Such expenditure is typically expensed to the income statement as the related intellectual property is not capable of being formalised and does not always have distinguishable research and development phases.
70 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued Significant accounting policies continued w IFRSs available for early adoption not yet applied The following standards and amendments to standards which will be relevant to the Group, were available for early adoption but have not been applied in these accounts: Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2011.
Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2012.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2012.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 27 2011 Separate Financial Statements mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements and Amendments to IAS 28 2008 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
Amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2014.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments mandatory for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2015.
None of these standards and amendments are expected to have a significant impact on the accounts when they are adopted except for amendments to IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans.
The amendments to IAS 19 are expected to reduce profit before tax and increase actuarial gains in other comprehensive income by the same amount.
There would be no impact on total equity.
The Group does not intend to adopt this standard early and the extent of the impact has not been determined.
Segmental analysis The Board is considered to be the chief operating decision maker of the Group in the context of the IFRS 8 definition.
The information which is reviewed by the Board for the purposes of assessing financial performance and allocating resources comprises the profit and loss account for the Company as a whole.
The Group is a centrally-managed business with an integrated supply chain.
There are seven retail regions, each reporting to the Group Retail Director.
The business performance is assessed after allocation of supply chain costs to the retail regions.
These retail regions have similar economic characteristics, products, customers and production and distribution methods and have therefore been aggregated into a single reportable segment.
The segment results, as reported to the chief operating decision maker, are calculated under the principles of IFRS.
Products and services - the Group sells a consistent range of fresh bakery goods, sandwiches and drinks in its shops.
Major customers - the majority of sales are made to the general public on a cash basis.
A small proportion of sales are made on credit to certain organisations, including wholesale customers, but these are immaterial in a Group context.
Geographical areas - all results arise in the UK.
Segmental analysis continued The Board has carefully considered the requirements of IFRS 8 and concluded that, as there is only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, assets and liabilities are measured and reported on a consistent basis with the Group financial statements no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Financial risk management Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Trade and other receivables The Groups exposure to credit risk is considered not to be significant as the majority of sales of goods are for cash.
Other receivables are primarily prepaid rent and rates as well as amounts owed from HM Revenue & Customs in respect of VAT.
The credit risk on remaining other receivables and trade receivables is therefore not considered significant.
Counterparty risk is also considered low.
All of the Groups surplus cash is held with highly rated banks, in line with Group policy.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group operates with net current liabilities because the majority of sales are for cash and limited stocks are held given their perishable nature.
It is therefore reliant on the continued strong performance of the retail portfolio to meet its short term liabilities.
This is a well established and proven business model.
Any increase in short-term liquidity risk can be mitigated by reducing the capital expenditure budget.
The Group has cash resources at the year end, and if necessary, would be able to obtain substantial debt funding.
The Group has overdraft facilities of 5,000,000 of which 5,000,000 was undrawn at 31 December 2011 2010: 5,000,000.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
Given that, as explained above, market risk is not significant, sensitivity analysis would not be meaningful.
Currency risk The Group has no regular transactions in foreign currency although there are occasional purchases, mainly of capital items, denominated in foreign currency.
Whilst certain costs such as electricity and wheat can be influenced by movements in the US dollar, actual contracts are priced in sterling.
In respect of those key costs which are volatile, such as electricity and flour, the price may be fixed for a period of time in line with Group policy.
All such contracts are for the Groups own expected usage.
Interest rate The Group has low exposure to interest rate risk.
Interest only arises on its bank deposits and overdrafts.
Net financial income in the year was 69,000 2010: 158,000.
Equity prices The Group has no equity investments other than its subsidiaries.
72 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 2.
Financial risk management continued Capital management The Board defines capital as the equity of the Group.
The Group remains net cash positive with funding requirements met by cash generated from retail operations.
The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable successful future development of the business.
The Boards policy on dividend levels is to pursue a progressive dividend policy that pays due regard to the growth of earnings per share over the medium term, the cash generative nature of our growing business and our continuing determination to deliver value to our shareholders.
The Board will continue to consider purchasing its own shares in the market dependent on market prices and surplus cash levels.
The trustees of the Greggs Employee Benefit Trust also purchase shares for future satisfaction of employee share options.
Financial instruments Group and Parent Company All of the Groups surplus cash is invested as cash placed on deposit or fixed-term deposits.
The Groups treasury policy has as its principal objective the achievement of the maximum rate of return on cash balances whilst maintaining an acceptable level of risk.
Other than mentioned below there are no financial instruments, derivatives or commodity contracts used.
Financial assets and liabilities The Groups main financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and fixed-term deposits.
Other financial assets include trade receivables arising from the Groups activities.
Other than trade and other payables, the Group had no financial liabilities within the scope of IAS 39 as at 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
Fair values The fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is not materially different from their carrying values.
Financial assets and liabilities comprise principally of trade receivables and trade payables and the only interest bearing balances are the bank deposits and borrowings which attract interest at variable rate.
Interest rate, credit and foreign currency risk The Group has not entered into any hedging transactions during the year and considers interest rate, credit and foreign currency risks not to be significant.

Pension amendment Following the UK Governments legislation announced in July 2010 that requires statutory indexation of pension benefits to be based on CPI rather than RPI, the Group informed pension members in April 2011 that this amendment would be applied to the Groups defined benefit pension scheme.
The exceptional credit represents the ensuing reduction in the net pension liability.
