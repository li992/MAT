Impairment of goodwill Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.

14 GOODWIll Cost and carrying value m At 26 December 2009, 25 December 2010 and 24 December 2011 2.5 The goodwill was recognised on the acquisition of the remaining 50% of Howden Joinery Supply Division Asia Limited HJ Asia during the period ended 27 December 2008.
Prior to this, HJ Asia was a 50%-owned joint venture, with no associated goodwill.
The Group tests annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU has been determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculation are: the expected future net benefits of using HJ Asia to source products at a saving compared to sourcing from elsewhere: discount rates and growth rates.
The estimates of future sourcing benefits are revised annually and are based on a detailed analysis of planned sourcing via HJ Asia over the next twelve months, and managements assessments of the net savings to be made from sourcing via HJ Asia, after taking into account the associated overhead costs of running the HJ Asia business.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money.
Because any Group borrowings are negotiated on the basis of the Group as a whole, management has chosen a discount rate which reflects their assessment of the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital 2011: 7.0%: 2010: 8.1%.
This is arrived at using the actual cost of the Groups current borrowings as a benchmark, which is then adjusted as necessary for any expected future changes.
The growth rates assume no growth other than inflation 2011: 3.35%: 2010: 3.5%, which does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the market in which HJ Asia operates.
The growth rate is felt to be appropriate in the current economic climate although management will continue to update this assumption in future periods in line with actual experience.
The value in use calculations use this growth rate to perpetuity.
The whole of the goodwill is allocated to the HJ Asia CGU.
The Group has conducted sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of the HJ Asia CGU.
Even with reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions, there is no indication that the carrying amount of the goodwill would be in excess of its recoverable amount.

18 DEFERRED Tax The following are the major deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised by the Group, and the movements on them during the current and prior reporting periods: Retirement benefit accelerated capital Other timing obligations allowances differences Total m m m m At 26 December 2009 55.1 2.2 10.8 68.1 Charge to income 7.2 2.4 2.4 12.0 Credit to equity 11.3 11.3 At 25 December 2010 36.6 0.2 8.4 44.8 Charge credit to income 8.2 0.4 4.1 11.9 Credit to equity 8.5 0.3 8.8 Effect of tax rate change Income statement 3.8 0.4 3.4 Effect of tax rate change Equity 6.5 6.5 At 24 December 2011 34.2 0.2 4.2 38.6 Deferred tax arising from accelerated capital allowances and short-term timing differences can be further analysed as a 9.2m asset and a 4.8m liability 2010: 13.5m asset and 5.3m liability.
The presentation in the balance sheet is as follows: 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m Deferred tax assets 43.4 50.1 Deferred tax liabilities 4.8 5.3 38.6 44.8 At the balance sheet date the Group had unused trading tax losses with a potential value of 13.2m 2010: 14.2m.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised as it is not considered probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised in the forseesable future.
All of these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

Their carrying value approximates to their fair value.
An analysis of the Groups allowance for doubtful receivables is as follows: 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m Balance at start of period 9.2 10.9 Decrease in allowance recognised in the income statement 0.5 1.7 Balance at end of period 8.7 9.2 The Groups exposure to the credit risk inherent in its trade receivables is discussed in note 30.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
Interest is charged at appropriate market rates on balances which are in litigation.
Before accepting any new credit customer, the Group obtains a credit check from an external agency to assess the potential customers credit quality, and then sets credit limits on a customer-by-customer basis.
These credit limits are reviewed regularly.
In the case of one-off customers, the Groups policy is to require immediate payment at the point of sale, and not to offer credit terms.
The historical level of customer default is low, and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high.
The Group reviews trade receivables past due but not impaired on a regular basis and considers, based on past experience, whether the credit quality of these amounts at the balance sheet date has deteriorated since the transaction was entered into, and therefore whether the amounts are recoverable or require provision.
Regular contact is maintained with all such customers and, where necessary, legal action is taken to recover the receivable.
An allowance for impairment is made for any specific amounts which are considered irrecoverable or only partly recoverable.
There is also a separate allowance which is calculated as a percentage of sales.
At the period end, the total bad debt provision of 8.7m 2010: 9.2m consists of a specific provision of 4.2m 2010: 4.2m which has been made against specific debts with a gross carrying value of 5.1m 2010: 4.8m, and a provision of 4.5m 2010: 5.0m based on sales and on the historic default rate.
To the extent that recoverable amounts are estimated to be less than their associated carrying values, impairment charges have been recorded in the income statement and the carrying values have been written down to their recoverable amounts.
84 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 5.9m debts were written off in the period 2010: 7.4m.
Included within the Groups aggregate trade receivables balance are specific debtor balances with customers totalling 14.2m before bad debt provision 2010: 15.1m before provision which are past due as at the reporting date.
The Group has assessed these balances for recoverability and believes that their credit quality remains intact.
An ageing analysis of these past due trade receivables is provided as follows: 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m 030 days past due 6.9 8.0 3060 days past due 1.3 1.4 6090 days past due 0.7 0.7 90 days past due 5.3 5.0 Total overdue amounts, excluding allowance for doubtful receivables 14.2 15.1 There were no trade receivables which would have been impaired at either period end were it not for the fact that their credit terms were renegotiated.
The Group does not renegotiate credit terms.
Other assets There are no other assets in the current period.
Other assets in the prior period were funds held in escrow to meet future insurance claims from furniture insurance policies written on behalf of the Groups customers.
These policies have now lapsed, and there is no need to hold the related assets.
The balance at the prior period end was 0.2m, and those monies were held with financial institutions which had an AArating or higher, and had maturities of up to one year.
Interest was paid at both fixed and floating rates based on LIBOR.
The carrying amount of those assets approximated to their fair value.
Cash at bank and in hand Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash at bank is either in current accounts or is placed on short-term deposit with maturity periods of less than three months.
Interest on short-term deposits is paid at prevailing money market rates.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
As explained in the accounting policy note, and as noted at the foot of the consolidated cash flow statement, this definition differs slightly from the definition of cash and cash equivalents, which is used in the cash flow statement, and which includes overdrafts repayable on demand.
assets pledged as security The Group has pledged its other financial assets to secure bank borrowings.

Their carrying value in both periods approximates to their fair value.
The average credit taken for trade purchases during the period, based on total operations, was 48 days 2010: 44 days.
The Groups policy on payment of creditors is to agree terms of payment prior to commencing trade with a supplier, and to abide by those terms on the timely submission of satisfactory invoices.

The terms of this facility are explained further in the final paragraph of note 30 a.
This facility is secured on the property, other assets, and investments of the Group.
The carrying values of each of these classes of assets is as presented in the balance sheet and notes to these consolidated financial statements.
The available facility limit is calculated every week, based on the asset backing at the time, and can never exceed 160m.
As at 24 December 2011, the Group had available 145m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met 2010: 130m.
In March 2010 the facility was extended until May 2014.
The loan carries interest at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin.
For 12 months from March 2010, this margin was fixed at 250 basis points.
From March 2011 to maturity, the margin will vary between 200 and 250 basis points and will be determined by the Groups rolling Adjusted Profit Before Tax.
Finance lease obligations There are no finance lease obligations at the current period end.
At the previous period end, there were finance lease obligations of 0.4m, which were all payable within one year from that period end.
All of those finance lease obligations were in sterling.
Each lease contract was at a fixed interest rate.
The weighted average of the fixed rates on the various contracts was 6.9% at the previous period end.
The finance lease obligations were unsecured and the average remaining lease term at the previous period end was 10 months.
At the previous period end, there were no reconciling items between the total future minimum lease payments and their present value.
Interest rate and fair value information for bank borrowings and lease obligations The weighted average interest rates paid were as follows: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 % % Finance lease obligations N A 6.9 Bank borrowings 3.4 3.4 The directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings are as follows: 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m Finance lease obligations 0.4 Bank borrowings 2.3 3.4 87 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 RETIREmENT BENEFIT OBlIGaTIONS Defined contribution plan The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for its employees.
The assets of this scheme are held separately from those of the Group and are under the control of the scheme trustees.
This scheme began operation during 2006.
The total cost charged to income in respect of this scheme in the current period of 1.1m 2010: 1.1m represents the Groups contributions due and paid in respect of the period.
Defined benefit plan The Group operates a funded pension scheme which provides benefits based on the pensionable pay of participating employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the income statement so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives with the Group.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, the related current service cost and past service cost are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent completed actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2008 by the scheme actuary.
At the current period end, the triennial actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2011 was in progress, but not completed.
The actuary advising the Group has subsequently rolled forward the preliminary results of the 5 April 2011 valuation to 24 December 2011, and has restated the results onto a basis consistent with market conditions at that date.

The underlying S1PMA and S1PFA tables are also adjusted by scaling factors.
Separate scaling factors apply to males and females and to the different categories of members.
The mortality assumption adopted by the Group in 2011 and 2010 is equivalent to the following life expectancies: 2011 2010 male yrs Female yrs male yrs Female yrs Non-pensioner age 45 89.1 91.5 90.8 92.1 Pensioner age 65 88.2 89.2 88.8 90.9 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions If there was an increase decrease in the discount rate of 0.25%, there would be a corresponding decrease increase in the scheme liabilities of around 5%, or 37m, and a decrease increase in the current service cost of around 7% or 0.8m.
An increase of 0.25% to the inflation rate would increase scheme liabilities by around 16m, or 2%, and would leave the current service cost unchanged.
A decrease of 0.25% to the inflation rate would decrease scheme liabilities by around 11m, or 1%, and would reduce current service cost by around 0.4m, or 4%.
The effect of changing the assumption regarding life expectancy by one year longer than shown above would be to increase the assessed value of liabilities by around 2%, or 15m, and would leave the current service cost unchanged.

A single long-term assumption is then calculated as the weighted average of the actual asset allocation and the long-term assumption for each asset class.
The expected rate of return on cash at the end of 2010 was relatively high because much of the cash being held at that time was waiting to be reinvested in other asset categories, and so an expected rate of return was chosen which reflected the expected return on the other asset categories.

For some properties, the provision is based on the shortfall between rent payable and rent receivable.
For other properties, where negotiations to surrender the lease are in progress, the provision is based on the amount which the landlord has indicated that they are willing to take as a premium in order for the Group to surrender the lease.
The provision is based on the period until the end of the lease, or until the Group considers that it can cover the shortfall by subletting, assigning or surrendering the lease.
Throughout the course of the year the Group reviews the range of options for unused properties and maintains ongoing discussions with landlords and external agents, with a view to identifying possible lease surrenders and finding tenants.
The property provision also includes amounts for any related shortfalls in business rates on these properties and for dilapidations, agents fees and other professional fees.
During the current period, the property provision has been increased by 0.2m arising from an unwinding of the discount rate over time.
None of this amount relates to a change in the discount rate.
This amount is shown as a finance charge in note 10.
There is a discussion of the main sources of estimation and uncertainty which apply to this provision in note 3.
The amount of the expected future cash flows has been adjusted to reflect the expected range of possibilities and, as the outflows under this provision are expected to take place over a number or years, the provision has been discounted to its present value.
7.7m of the additional provision in the year has been treated as an exceptional item and is explained further at note 6.
The timing of outflows from the provision is variable, and is dependent on property lease expiry dates and on opportunities to surrender leases.
The other provision relates to amounts due in respect of product warranties.

95 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 SHaRE-BaSED PaymENTS 1 Details of each scheme The Group recognised a charge of 2.7m 2010: charge of 1.4m in respect of share-based payments during the period.
The Group has various share-based payment schemes which are all equity-settled.
The main details of all schemes which existed during the period are given below: a Performance Share Plan This is a discretionary free share plan where participants have a contingent right to receive free shares with performance conditions attached.
The performance period is measured from the start of the financial period in which the awards are granted.
The performance period is three years.
Vesting occurs at the end of the performance period.
The different subdivisions and performance conditions are as follows: i 25% of the award vests if 2010 PBT of 110m is achieved.
100% vests if 2010 PBT of 135m is achieved.
The awards vest on a sliding scale between these two points.
b Deferred Bonus Plan 2010 restricted share award The shares are held in trust and participants are entitled to dividends during the deferral period.
A participant can remove the shares from the Trust at any time but as they would no longer be pledged as Invested Shares under the Co-Investment Plan, then unless replaced, the participant would forego the resulting match.
c Co-Investment Plan This is a co-investment plan where each participant is permitted to invest a limited amount of shares on an annual basis for the purposes of the plan.
At the end of a three year performance period, each invested share will be matched by an award of up to three matching shares if 2010 PBT of 135m is achieved: 25% of the maximum match i. e. 0.75:1 will be earned for achieving 2010 PBT of 110m and the awards will vest on a sliding scale between these two points.
A further match of up to two shares will be made for achieving upper quartile Total Shareholder Return TSR, measured against the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts.
iii 2011 award: 25% of the award will vest if PBT growth at the end of the 2013 financial year is at a rate of 6% p. a. based on the December 2010 accounts.
100% of the award will vest if PBT growth on the same basis is 12% p. a. or above.
d Executive Share Options This is a discretionary share option plan.
These options are granted with an exercise price equal to market value.
The vesting period is three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of seven years i. e. a total life of ten years.
In the information below, these options have been further subdivided according to their different performance conditions, in order to give more meaningful information.
The different subdivisions and performance conditions are as follows: i 40% vesting if EPS growth equals RPI 40%, rising to 100% vesting for EPS growth of RPI 100%.
ii 50% vesting if there is EPS growth of 60% over the performance period, and 100% vesting if there is EPS growth of 120% over the performance period.
iii EPS growth must equal RPI 9%.
If this is achieved there will be full vesting.
If this is not achieved there will be no vesting.
iv 20% of the options will vest if the share price over 30 consecutive dealing days is 185p rising on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting if the share price over 30 consecutive days reaches 265p.
Underpinning this is a requirement to achieve 20% annual compound growth over the performance period.
v Full vesting will occur if the Groups cumulative profit before tax is at least 90m over the three financial years ending December 2009, 2010 and 2011.
96 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 e long Term Incentive Plan This is a discretionary plan under which the Group may grant different types of share award including market value and nil cost options, conditional awards of shares and restricted shares where the employee is the owner of the shares from the date of award but subject to forfeiture.
Unless otherwise specified all awards have substantially the same terms.
i Market value options, the vesting period for which is three years from the date of grant with an exercise period of seven years i. e. a total life of ten years.
Options will vest if cumulative PBT of 90m is achieved over the three financial years ending 2009, 2010 and 2011. ii Market value which vest after a three year period from the date of grant.
15% of the options will vest if the Group achieves growth in pre-exceptional PBT equivalent to RPI over the performance period: 100% will vest if preexceptional PBT growth equivalent to RPI 8% is achieved.
iii Conditional Share Award shares will vest at the end of a three year period commencing on the date of grant subject to continuing employment.
iv 2011 Grant 25% of the award will vest if PBT growth at the end of the 2013 financial year is at a rate of 6% p. a. based on the December 2010 accounts.
f Share Incentive Scheme FreeShares This is an all-employee share incentive plan whereby participants receive a grant of free shares in the Group.
If the employees are still employed by the Group three years after the grant, then the shares vest.
Dividends are paid out on the shares between award date and vesting date.
There are no other performance conditions attached to these awards.

options granted is estimated on the date of grant using a Black Scholes model as they are not considered to be of such complexity that they require an alternative model.
The key assumptions used in the models were: 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 Dividend yield % 1.5 Expected share price volatility % 54 53 Historical volatility % 54 53 Risk-free interest rate % 3.0 3.4 Expected life of options years 4.8 6.5 Historical volatility is measured for each scheme over the period equal to the vesting period of the scheme.
The figure arrived at is then used as the best estimate of expected future volatility.

105 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 30 FINaNCIal RISk maNaGEmENT a Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to maximise the return to shareholders through the optimisation of its debt and equity balance, trading-off the benefits of financial leverage with the expected future costs of financial distress.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt including the borrowings disclosed in note 22 offset by cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent including issued share capital and reserves as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity and in note 25.
The Board of Directors reviews the capital structure regularly, including, but not limited to, at the time of preparing annual budgets, preparing three year corporate plans, and considering corporate transactions.
As part of this review, the Board reviews the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group will balance its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buy-backs, as well as the issue of new debt or the repayment of existing debt.
At the period end, the Group had a 160m committed bank facility secured against the assets of the Group and based on four sub-facilities stock, trade receivables, property and a cash flow facility.
The facility limit was the lower of 160m and the sum of the four sub-facilities.
The property component initially 17.4m amortises at the rate of 141,667 each month, whereas the other components act as a revolving credit facility with no amortisation.
Under the terms of the facility, none of the Groups principal subsidiary companies can sign up to additional secured borrowings, other than those expressly permitted within the terms of the facility.
The facility i permits normal trade credit granted to it in the ordinary course of business, ii allows up to 20m of additional secured borrowings and iii allows up to 10m of finance lease borrowing.
During the previous period the maturity of the facility was extended from May 2011 to May 2014.
As part of the extension the facility was reduced from 175m to 160m alongside a revised interest rate structure.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from 2010. b Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.

The Board has approved and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits, controlling and reporting structures.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed, and the quantification of the level of exposure in the balance sheet is shown below sub-categorised into credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
The Group is actively engaged in the management of all of these financial risks in order to minimise their potential adverse impact on the Groups financial performance.
106 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 The principles, practices and procedures governing the Group-wide financial risk management process have been approved by the Board and are overseen by the Executive Committee.
In turn, the Executive Committee delegates authority to a central treasury function Group Treasury for the practical implementation of the financial risk management process across the Group and for ensuring that the Groups entities adhere to specified financial risk management policies.
Group Treasury regularly reassesses and reports on the financial risk environment, identifying and evaluating financial risks.
The Group does not take positions on derivative contracts and only enters into contractual bank deposit or lending arrangements with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank and in hand, which is the term used in the balance sheet, comprises cash on hand together with demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and cash equivalents, which is the term used in the cash flow statement, comprises cash at bank and in hand, as defined immediately above, together with any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Arrangements are in place to ensure that cash is utilised most efficiently for the ongoing working capital needs of the Groups operating units and to ensure that the Group earns the most advantageous rates of interest available.
The prime consideration in the investment of cash balances is the security of the asset, followed by liquidity and then yield.
Management of trade receivables is discussed in note 20. e Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, other assets, and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is mainly confined to the risk of customers defaulting on sales invoices raised.
The Group has adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties as a way of mitigating the risk of financial loss from defaults.
The Groups policy on dealing with trade customers is described in the accounting policies and in note 20.
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on liquid funds through adherence to a policy of minimum long-term counterparty credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies Standard & Poors A and Moodys A1.
Full disclosure of the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is presented in the following table: 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m Trade receivables net of allowance 73.0 68.9 Cash and cash equivalents 59.4 38.6 Other assets 0.2 Total credit risk exposure 132.4 107.7 f liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group could experience difficulties in meeting its commitments to creditors as financial liabilities fall due for payment.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by using reasonable and  assumptions to forecast the future cash-generative capabilities and working capital requirements of the businesses it operates and by maintaining sufficient reserves, committed borrowing facilities and other credit lines as appropriate.
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has agreed an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities as far as is possible.
Included in note 22 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
In addition, the Review of Operations and Finance contains a section describing the interaction of liquidity risk and the going concern review.
107 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued maturity profile of outstanding financial liabilities The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The Group has no derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.

108 Howden Joinery Group Plc Annual report & accounts 2011 g market risk This is the risk that financial instrument fair values will fluctuate owing to changes in market prices.
The significant market risks to which the Group is exposed are foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk.
These are discussed further below: Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to several currencies, principally as a result of operating costs incurred in foreign currencies, and to a lesser extent from non-Sterling revenues.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge such exposures.
The exposure of the Groups financial assets and liabilities to currency risk is as follows: 24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m Euro Trade receivables 2.6 1.9 Cash and cash equivalents 2.4 2.2 Trade payables 8.9 11.8 3.9 7.7 uS dollar Trade receivables 0.3 Cash and cash equivalents 3.7 3.5 Trade payables 1.9 2.9 1.8 0.9 Hong kong dollar Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 0.1 Chinese yuan Cash and cash equivalents 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 Japanese yen Trade payables 0.1 0.1 Total 1.8 6.7 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as the parent company has borrowed funds at floating interest rates.
The Board has reviewed this risk of interest rate increases causing financial distress and concluded that hedging protection should only be considered if net borrowings or cash surpluses were to exceed 150m.
The Groups exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note.
Payments on the Groups finance leases are fixed on inception of the lease contract, and as such are regarded as fixed rate borrowings.
109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued h Financial instrument sensitivities Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, trade receivables and trade payables.
The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial instruments as at its year end to changes in market variables, being exchange rates and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the year end date was outstanding for the whole year.
As a consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position as at the balance sheet date.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Debt and other deposits are carried at amortised cost and therefore carrying value does not change as interest rates move.
No sensitivity is provided for accrued interest as accruals are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate movements.
Finance lease interest payments are fixed at the inception of the contract and are not subject to re-pricing.
They have therefore been excluded from this analysis.
Translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Groups presentation currency have been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following analyses show the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency or interest rates.
Interest rate sensitivity The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for floating rate nonderivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The Group holds no derivative financial instruments.
Fixed rate liabilities are not susceptible to changes in interest rates, and are omitted from the analysis below.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 50 basis points increase is used as this represents managements assessment of the possible change in interest rates.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 50 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups net profit and profit and loss reserve would remain the same 2010: decrease by 0.1m.
For an decrease of 50 basis points, the current year figures would remain the same and the 2010 figures would increase by 0.1m.
Foreign exchange sensitivity As noted above, the Group is mainly exposed to movements in Euro, US dollar, Chinese Yuan, and Japanese Yen exchange rates the Hong Kong dollar being effectively pegged to the US dollar.
The following information details the Groups sensitivity to a 10% weakening or strengthening in pounds Sterling against the Euro, the US dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese Yuan, and the Japanese Yen.
These percentages are the rates used by management when assessing sensitivities internally and represent managements assessment of the possible change in foreign currency rates.
The sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
24 December 2011 25 December 2010 m m 10% weakening of Sterling to Euro 0.4 0.8 10% strengthening of Sterling to Euro 0.4 0.7 10% weakening of Sterling to US dollar 0.2 0.1 10% strengthening of Sterling to US dollar 0.2 0.1 The Groups sensitivity, on the basis above, to a strengthening or weakening of Sterling to the Hong Kong dollar, the Chinese Yuan and the Japanese Yen was less than 0.1m at both the current and prior period ends.
