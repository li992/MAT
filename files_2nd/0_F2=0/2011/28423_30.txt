2 Operating profits are determined on the basis of including longer-term investment returns.
EEV and IFRS operating profits are stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns against long-term assumptions, the shareholders share of actuarial and other gains and losses on defined benefit pension schemes, transaction costs arising from business combinations in the period and costs associated with the terminated AIA transaction.
In addition, for EEV basis results, operating profit excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the market value movements on core borrowings.
3 Asia comparative APE new business sales prior to 2011 exclude the Japanese insurance operations, which ceased writing new business from 15 February 2010.
4 Funds under management comprise funds of the Group held in the statement of financial position and external funds that are managed by Prudential asset management operations.
5 The surpluses shown are before allowing for the final dividends for each year, which are paid in the following year.
Since 2007, following the sale of Egg Banking, Prudential has been subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Insurance Groups Directive IGD which applies to groups whose activities are mainly in the insurance sector.
Prior to the sale of Egg Banking, Prudential was subject to the capital adequacy requirements of the Financial Conglomerates Directive FCD which applies to groups with significant cross-sector activities in insurance and banking investment services.
Prudential was classified as an insurance conglomerate under the FCD.
As the requirements for insurance conglomerates under the FCD are closely aligned to the requirements for insurance groups under the IGD, the move for Prudential from FCD to IGD did not result in a significant impact.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Additional unaudited Financial statements financial information 439 II a : Analysis of long-term insurance business pre-tax IFRS operating profit based on longer-term investment returns by driver This classifies the Groups pre-tax operating earnings from long-term insurance operations into the underlying drivers of those profits, using the following categories: i Spread income represents the difference between net investment income or premium income in the case of the UK annuities new business and amounts credited to policyholder accounts.
It excludes the longer-term investment return on assets in excess of those covering shareholder-backed policyholder liabilities, which has been separately disclosed as expected return on shareholder assets.
ii Fee income represents profits driven by net investment performance, being asset management fees that vary with the size of the underlying policyholder funds net of investment management expenses.
iii With-profits business represents the shareholders transfer from the with-profits fund in the period.
iv Insurance margin primarily represents profits derived from the insurance risks of mortality, morbidity and persistency.
v Margin on revenues primarily represents amounts deducted from premiums to cover acquisition costs and administration expenses.
vi Acquisition costs and administration expenses represent expenses incurred in the period attributable to shareholders.
It excludes items such as restructuring costs and Solvency II costs, which are not included in the segment profit for insurance, as well as items that are more appropriately included in other source of earnings lines eg investment expenses are netted off investment income as part of spread income or fee income as appropriate.
vii DAC adjustments comprises DAC amortisation for the period, excluding amounts related to short-term fluctuations, net of costs deferred in respect of new business.

Following the reduction in 2010 of the Groups interest in the PruHealth and PruProtect businesses from 50 per cent to 25 per cent, the profits of these businesses have been shown as a single line in the insurance margin line in 2011, consistent with associate accounting principles.
2010 has been amended in light of this change.
Margin analysis of long-term insurance business The following analysis expresses certain of the Groups sources of operating profit as a margin of policyholder liabilities or other suitable driver.
Details of the Groups average policyholder liability balances are given in D2 c, D3 c and D4 c. Total 2011 2010 Average Average Profit Liability Margin Profit Liability Margin Long-term business m m bps m m bps Spread income 1,065 57,417 185 1,013 53,894 188 Fee income 870 68,298 127 688 56,822 121 With-profits 331 93,056 36 342 89,693 38 Insurance margin 736 592 Margin on revenues 1,425 1,212 Expenses: Acquisition costs 1,783 3,681 48 % 1,645 3,492 47 % Administration expenses 1,043 125,715 83 924 110,716 83 DAC adjustments 280 518 Expected return on shareholder assets 200 242 Operating profit 2,081 2,038 The average liability balance is generally calculated as the average of the opening and closing liability balances as this is seen as a good proxy for average balances throughout the year.
Given the volatility in the year, the calculation of average liabilities has been refined for Jackson in two ways: i the average for both the general and the separate account balances is now derived from month-end balances throughout the year as opposed to opening and closing balances only, and ii liabilities held in the general account for variable annuity living and death guaranteed benefits have been excluded from the calculation of the average as no spread income is earned on these balances.
The 2010 balances for Jackson have been amended for consistency albeit impacts are minimal.
The ratio for acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of APE including with-profits sales and Japan 2011: nil: 2010: 7 million.
Acquisition costs include only those relating to shareholders.

Analysis of Asian IFRS operating profit drivers Spread income has increased by 18 million from 70 million in 2010 to 88 million in 2011, an increase of 26 per cent that predominantly reflects the growth of the Asian non-linked policyholder liabilities: Fee income has increased by 9 million from 122 million in 2010 to 131 million in 2011, broadly in line with the movement in unit-linked liabilities following continued positive net flows into unit-linked business: Insurance margin has increased by 85 million from 392 million in 2010 to 477 million in 2011, predominantly reflecting the continued growth of the in-force book, which contains a relatively high proportion of risk-based products.
2011 includes 38 million 2010: 19 million of non-recurring items, reflecting assumption changes and other items that are not expected to reoccur in future periods: Margin on revenues has increased by 181 million to 1,199 million in 2011, reflecting the ongoing growth in the size of the portfolio.
During the year the new business mix has moved towards those countries that levy higher premium charges eg Indonesia : Acquisition costs have increased by 17 per cent from 656 million in 2010 to 766 million in 2011, ahead of the 10 per cent increase in sales.
This trend is distorted by the changes in country mix, particularly by the reduction of sales in India.
Excluding India, acquisition costs were 21 per cent higher compared to a 18 per cent increase in sales.
The analysis above uses shareholder acquisition costs as a proportion of total APE.
If with-profits sales were excluded from the denominators, the acquisition cost ratio would become 59 per cent 2010: 53 per cent.
Excluding India 2011: 61 per cent, 2010: 58 per cent : Administration expenses have increased from 467 million in 2010 to 503 million in 2011.
The administration expense ratio has improved from 299 bps in 2010 to 280 bps in 2011 as we continue to see the benefits of operational leverage: and Expected return on shareholder assets has increased by 7 million to 26 million, principally reflecting higher shareholder assets and lower investment expenses in the period.

The 2010 balances have been amended for consistency, albeit impacts are minimal.
The ratio for acquisition costs is calculated as a percentage of total APE.
Analysis of US IFRS operating profit drivers Spread income benefited by 113 million in 2011 from the effect of transactions entered into in 2011 and 2010 to more closely match the overall asset and liability duration 2010: 108 million.
Excluding this effect, the spread margin would have been 218 bps 2010: 205 bps.
The reported spread margin increased from 243 bps in 2010 to 258 bps in 2011.
This is despite the downward pressure on yields caused by the low interest rate environment, the effect of which continues to be mitigated by reductions in crediting rates: Fee income has increased by 34 per cent to 680 million in 2011, broadly in line with the growth in separate account balances.
The growth in account balances during 2011 reflected the strong net flows from variable annuity business: Insurance margin represents operating profits from insurance risks, including variable annuity guarantees and other sundry items.
Positive net flows into variable annuity business with life contingent and other guarantee fees have primarily resulted in an improvement in the margin from 188 million in 2010 to 232 million in 2011: Acquisition costs have increased in absolute terms compared to 2010, due largely to the significant increase in sales volumes.
However, acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE is slightly lower at 70 per cent in 2011, with the decrease attributable to a reduced rate of marketing costs and lower average commissions: Administration expenses increased to 412 million in 2011, compared to 344 million in 2010, primarily as a result of higher asset based commission paid on the larger 2011 separate account balance.
These asset based commissions paid upon policy anniversary dates are treated as an administration expense in this analysis as opposed to a cost of acquisition, and are offset by higher fees.
The administration cost was marginally higher at 66 bps 2010: 64 bps.
Excluding trail commission amounts, the resulting administration expense ratio would be 46 bps 2010: 48 bps : and DAC adjustments decreased by 246 million to 271 million in 2011 compared to 517 million in 2010.
This mainly reflects additional DAC amortisation of approximately 166 million related to the reversal of the benefit received in 2008 from the mean reversion formula, as well as accelerated DAC amortisation of 66 million as separate account returns, were lower than 2010.

Following the reduction in 2010 of the Groups interest in the PruHealth and PruProtect businesses from 50 per cent to 25 per cent, the profits of these businesses have been shown as a single line in the insurance margin line in 2011, consistent with associate accounting priciples.
Analysis of UK IFRS operating profit drivers Spread income remains broadly unchanged from 2010 at 247 million 2010: 251 million.
The margin has fallen from 120 bps to 105 bps principally due to 2010 benefiting from higher bulk annuity sales, partly offset by the benefit of portfolio restructuring undertaken in the year and higher yields being achieved on new individual annuity business: Insurance margin has increased from 12 million in 2010 to 27 million in 2011, principally driven by an improvement in the profitability of PruHealth and PruProtect: Margin on revenues represents premiums charges for expenses and other sundry net income received by the UK.
Higher amounts were recorded in 2011 226 million compared to 2010 194 million, reflecting higher sundry income and an increase in premiums from shareholder-backed retail business in 2011 as compared to 2010: Acquisition costs as a percentage of new business sales has remained constant with 2010 at 17 per cent: The ratio above expresses the percentage of shareholder acquisition costs as a percentage of total APE sales.
It is therefore impacted by the level of with-profit sales in the year.
Acquisition costs as a percentage of shareholder-backed new business sales were 33 per cent in 2011 30 per cent in 2010, due in part to the beneficial effect in 2010 of the higher level of bulk annuity transactions, which had a relatively modest level of acquisition costs: Administration expenses have increased by 15 million to 128 million in 2011 primarily as a result of increased project expenditure, resulting in a marginally higher administration expense ratio of 28 bps in 2011 2010: 27 bps : and Expected return on shareholder asset has fallen from 98 million in 2010 to 91 million in 2011 following a reduction in assumed longer-term yields on assets backing shareholder capital.

Margin represents operating income as a proportion of the related funds under management FUM.
Opening and closing internal and external funds managed by the respective entity have been used to derive the average.
Any funds held by the Groups insurance operations which are managed by third parties outside of the Prudential Group are excluded from these amounts.
Cost income ratio is calculated as cost as a percentage of income excluding performance-related fees.
As noted above, the margins on operating income are based on the average of the opening and closing FUM balances.
For M&G, if a monthly average FUM had been used, the retail margins would have been 95 bps for 2011 and 2010.
446 Financial statements | Additional unaudited financial information Additional unaudited financial information continued III a : A doption of altered US GAAP requirements to Group IFRS reporting in 2012 Change to accounting policy for deferral of acquisition costs for operations applying US GAAP measurement principles to insurance assets and liabilities from 1 January 2012 Background Under the Groups accounting policies the measurement of insurance assets and liabilities reflects the application of UK GAAP under the Modified Statutory Basis MSB.
This has been applied from when the Company first adopted IFRS in 2005, subject to subsequent policy improvements under IFRS 4.
The MSB in turn is based on the codification in the 2003 ABI Statement of Recommended Practice which, subject to various restrictions, permits the use of local bases for overseas operations.
Accordingly, since 2005, the insurance assets and liabilities of the Groups US operations have been measured using US GAAP.
This basis has also been explicitly applied to those Asian operations namely India, Japan, Taiwan and Vietnam where the local regulatory basis is not appropriate as a starting point for deriving MSB compliant results.
In October 2010, the Emerging Issues Task Force of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Update No 2010-26 on Accounting for Costs Associated with Acquiring or Renewing Insurance Contracts.
The update was issued to address perceived diversity by companies preparing financial statements in accordance with US GAAP as regards the types of acquisition costs being deferred.
Under US GAAP, costs that can be deferred and amortised are those that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts.
The Update requires insurers to capitalise only those incremental costs directly related to acquiring a contract for financial statements for reporting periods starting after 15 December 2011.
All other indirect acquisition expenses are required to be charged to the income statement as incurred expenses.
Accordingly, the main impact of the Update is to disallow insurers from deferring costs that are not directly related to successful sales.
Under the Update, US insurers preparing financial statements under US GAAP can choose to make a prospective or a retrospective application.
Under the prospective basis, the change is confined to the income statement from the date of adoption to incorporate the additional charge for non-deferrable expenses for the activity of the reporting period.
No changes are made to the results of comparative periods.
By contrast, under retrospective application, the deferred acquisition costs balances in the statement of financial position for comparative periods are reset so as to only defer those costs permitted by the Update.
In the income statement, the net effect of the Update reflects: i as for the prospective basis, the additional charge for non deferrable expenses for the activity of the reporting period, offset by ii a reduced charge for DAC amortisation reflecting the lower level of expenses that could be deferred on prior period activity.
Under the Groups IFRS reporting, Prudential has the option to either continue with its current basis of measurement or improve its accounting policy under IFRS 4 to acknowledge the issuance of the Update.
Prudential has chosen to continue with its current basis of measurement for reporting of its 2011 results and improve its policy in 2012 to apply the US GAAP update on the retrospective basis to the results of its US insurance operation, Jackson.
The reason and timing for the change is to achieve consistency with the basis expected to be applied by peer competitor companies in the US market in their US GAAP financial statements.
To ensure consistency, it is also intended to make the change on the retrospective basis in 2012 for the Asian operations that historically have effectively applied US GAAP for measuring insurance assets and liabilities.

r 452 Financial statements | Additional unaudited financial information Additional unaudited financial information continued IV a : Reconciliation of expected transfer of fair value of in-force VIF and required capital business of free surplus Expected transfer of value of in-force VIF and required capital business to free surplus The tables below show how the VIF generated by the in-force long-term business and the associated required capital is modelled as emerging into free surplus over the next 40 years.
Although a small amount 1 per cent of the Groups embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the early years is considered most meaningful.
The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Groups embedded-value reporting, and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities.
In addition to showing the amounts, both discounted and undiscounted, expected to be generated from all in-force business at 31 December 2011, the tables also present the expected future free surplus to be generated from the investment made in new business during 2011 over the same 40-year period.
In particular, it excludes the value of the shareholders interest in the estate.
It also excludes any free surplus emerging after 2051.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2011 Additional unaudited Financial statements financial information 455 At 31 December 2011, the total free surplus expected to be generated over the next five years years 2012-2016 inclusive, using the same assumptions and methodology as underpin our embedded-value reporting was 8.0 billion, an increase of 0.6 billion from the 7.4 billion expected over the same period at the end of 2010.
This increase reflected the new business written in 2011, which is expected to generate 1,194 million of free surplus over the next five years.
Operating movements were positive 56 million, less than 1 per cent of our 2012 to 2016 free surplus expectation at the end of 2010.
Market effects and foreign exchange movements reduced expected free surplus generation for the next five years by 609 million and 52 million respectively.
Market movements in Asia include the effect of lower fund-earned rates in Indonesia, Singapore and Hong Kong where government yields have fallen by 165 bps, 110 bps and 140 bps respectively.
In the US, lower US treasury bond yields have led to a reduction in the assumed variable annuity separate return, which has had a consequential negative impact on the level of projected future fees.
Market movements in the UK primarily reflect the adverse effect on with-profits bonus rates of lower assumed investment returns.
At 31 December 2011, the total free surplus expected to be generated on an undiscounted basis in the next 40 years is 34 billion.
Notwithstanding the drag on future earnings caused by the market effects on fee and with-profits business referred to above, the expected free surplus generation over the next 40 years has increased.
This reflects both our ability to write new business on very attractive economics and the robust management of the in-force book.
