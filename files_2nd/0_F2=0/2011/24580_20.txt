The address of the registered oce is One College Square South, Anchor Road, Bristol BS1 5HL, United Kingdom.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the Business Review.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements of Hargreaves Lansdown plc have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and interpretations issued by the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee of the IASB together IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Company's financial statements have been prepared on the same basis and as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no income statement is presented for the Company.
In the current year amendments to IAS 24, Related Party Disclosures which extends the denition of a related party and IAS 32, Financial instruments: Presentation on classication of rights issues were confirmed.
In addition, the IASB's 2010 annual improvements project makes minor changes to IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, IFRS 3, Business combinations and IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
None of these changes have any impact on the financial statements.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments was reissued, and new standards IFRS 10, Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements, IFRS 12, Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities and IFRS 13, Fair Value Measurement were issued, applicable from 1 January 2013.
The Group is currently reviewing the impact of these new standards but does not intend to adopt the standards early.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
2. significant accounting policies Accounting policies as shown below have been consistently applied throughout the current and prior financial year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 30 June 2011.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the eective date of acquisition or up to the eective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group and Company financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as discussed on page 39. Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
Any gains or losses on sale of the Companys own shares held by the Hargreaves Lansdown Employee benefit Trust EBT are credited directly to the EBT reserve and are treated as undistributable profits.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups classied as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Noncurrent assets and disposal groups are classied as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition.
Management must be committed to the sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classication.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate, or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS on 1 July 2005 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written o to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 30 June 1997 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
52 Back to contents Notes to the Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes.
Fund based commissions are recognised on an accruals basis calculated according to the level of assets under the administration, or agency, of the Group.
The Groups stockbroking and unit trust management subsidiaries earn initial commission on securities transactions entered into on behalf of clients.
The commission earned is recorded in the accounts on the date of the transaction, as this is the date on which the service is provided to the client and the Group becomes entitled to the income.
The Group also earns initial commission from third party providers on the set up of group pension schemes.
Initial commissions are deemed to be earned at the policy inception date on those policies where there are only negligible ongoing services.
Where ongoing services are provided, an appropriate proportion of the income is deferred over the relevant period.
Where such commission is received on an indemnity basis, a provision is made for clawbacks, if any, which would be due if the policy lapses during the indemnity period.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, using the eective interest rate method.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment revenue and finance costs.
Underlying operating profit is stated before investment revenue, finance costs and one-o costs relating to the FSCS additional levy and the new oces.
Retirement benefit costs The Group operates a group self-invested personal pension plan for sta.
Payments to the dened contribution retirement benefit scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Bonuses payable to employees The Group recognises a liability and an expense for sta bonuses where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value where the eect is material.
Provisions are recognised for future committed property lease payments when the group receives no benefit from the property through continuing usage and future receipts from any sub-letting arrangements are not in excess of the groups future committed payments.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit diers from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on dierences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary dierences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary dierences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary dierence arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that aects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary dierences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary dierence and it is probable that the temporary dierence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that sucient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are oset when there is a legally enforceable right to set o current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
53 Governance Performance Review Strategic Review Introduction Financial Statements Hargreaves Lansdown plc Report and Financial Statements 2011 Back to contents Notes to the Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 July 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the eect of non-market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the eect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the eects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Prior to 15 May 2007 the Companys shares were not listed on a stock exchange and therefore, in the absence of a readily available market price for the shares, the share price was based on the market value agreed with HM Revenue & Customs and share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility applying to a comparable group of listed companies.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is provided, where material, on all tangible xed assets at rates calculated to write o the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Fixtures, ttings, plant and equipment: Leasehold property tenants xtures over the life of the lease Oce equipment over 10 years Computer equipment and software over 3 to 4 years Motor vehicles: over 4 years The carrying values of tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the dierence between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Leasing Leases are classied as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benets received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets excluding goodwill Other intangible assets comprise computer software which is stated at cost less amortisation and any recognised impairment loss.
Amortisation is provided, where material, on all intangible xed assets excluding goodwill at rates calculated to write o the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly using a straight-line method over its estimated useful life as follows: Computer software: over 3 to 4 years The carrying values of computer software are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Website development design and content development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset, which delivers benets at least as great as the amount capitalised.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Dividend recognition Dividend distributions to the Companys shareholders are recognised in the accounting period in which the dividends are declared and paid, or if earlier, in the accounting period when the dividend is approved by the Companys shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
54 Back to contents Notes to the Financial Statements 2. significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, Stock Exchange member rms and other counterparties are included as debtors.
Market debtors and creditors are presented net where there is a legal right of oset.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
The Groups available-for-sale investments have been included at fair value where a fair value can be reliably calculated, with the revaluation gains and losses reected in the investment revaluation reserve, as shown in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 48, until sale when the cumulative gain or loss is transferred to the income statement.
If a fair value cannot be reliably calculated by reference to a quoted market price or other method of valuation, available-for-sale investments are included at cost where the directors believe that cost is not materially dierent to fair value, with a fair value adjustment recognised upon disposal of the investment.
Investments which are designated as being held at fair value through profit or loss are carried at fair value, being the quoted market price of the listed investment, with any gain or loss reported within the income statement.
An investment is classied in this category if it is held principally for the purpose of selling in the short term.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
Included within cash balances are amounts held on client settlement accounts as shown in note 17.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classied according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables are measured at fair value which is equivalent to amortised cost.
In accordance with market practice, certain balances with clients, Stock Exchange member rms and other counterparties are included as creditors.

Key sources of judgements and estimation uncertainty The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that aect the reported amount of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities.
If in the future such estimates and assumptions, which are based on managements best judgement at the date of preparation of the financial statements, deviate from actual circumstances, the original estimates and assumptions will be modied as appropriate in the period in which the circumstances change.
The areas where a higher degree of judgement or complexity arise, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements, are discussed below.
Share-based payments In determining the fair value of equity-settled share-based awards and the related charge to the income statement, the Group makes assumptions about the future events and market conditions.
In particular, judgement must be formed as to the likely number of shares that will vest, and the fair value of each award granted.
The fair value is determined using a valuation model which is dependent on future estimates, including the Groups future dividend policy, the timing with which the options will be exercised and the future volatility in the price of the Groups shares.
Dierent assumptions about these factors to those made by the Group could materially aect the reported value of share-based payments.
Sta costs Included in sta costs is an estimate of the future liability for bonuses and other employee incentive schemes which have been earned but not paid.
Indemnity provision Following a change in the prole of the Groups involvement with pension scheme policies, the provision for indemnity commission clawbacks is immaterial and is no longer identied as a key source of estimation uncertainty.
Revenue Revenue represents commission receivable from financial services provided to clients, interest on settlement accounts and management fees charged to clients.
It relates to services provided in the UK and is stated net of value added tax.
An analysis of the Groups revenue is as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 2011 30 June 2010 000 000 Revenue from services:- Fees and commission income 171,012 135,738 Interest and similar income 33,107 20,521 Subscriptions and sundry charges 3,785 2,711 Total operating income 207,904 158,970 5.
Segment information The Group is organised into three business segments, namely the Vantage Division, the Discretionary Division and the Third Party Other Services Division.
This is based upon the Groups internal organisation and management structure and is the primary way in which the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM is provided with financial information.
The CODM has been identied as the Board of Executive Directors.
The Vantage division represents all activities relating to the Vantage service, our direct to private investor platform.
The Discretionary Managed division is focused on the provision of managed services such as our Portfolio Management Service PMS and range of Multi-Manager funds.
The Third Party Other Services division includes activities relating to the broking of third party investments and pensions, certicated share dealing and other niche services such as currency, CFDs and spread betting.
In this division, clients investments are not administered within the Group.
The Group segment contains items that are shared by the Group as a whole and cannot be reasonably allocated to other operating segments.
Segment expenses are those that are directly attributable to a segment together with the relevant portion of other expenses that can reasonably be allocated to the segment.
Gains or losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments, investment income, interest payable and tax are not allocated by segment.
Segment assets and liabilities include items that are directly attributable to a segment plus an allocation on a reasonable basis of shared items.
Corporate assets and liabilities are not included in business segments and are thus unallocated.
At 30 June 2011 and 2010, these comprise cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, tax-related and other assets or liabilities.
Consolidation adjustments relate to the elimination of inter-segment revenues, balances and investments in group subsidiaries required on consolidation.

A deferred tax asset in respect of future share option deductions has been recognised based on the Companys share price as at 30 June 2011.
Factors aecting future tax charge Any increase or decrease to the Companys share price will impact the amount of tax deduction available in future years on the value of shares acquired by sta under share incentive schemes.
The standard rate of UK corporation tax is due to reduce to 25% for the 2012 financial year, 24% for the 2013 financial year and 23% for the 2014 financial year.

Earnings per share EPS Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, including ordinary shares held in the EBT reserve which have vested unconditionally with employees.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Underlying basic earnings per share and underlying diluted earnings per share are calculated as for basic and diluted earnings per share, but using an underlying earnings gure such that the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company is stated before investment gains and before the FSCS levy in 2011 and one-o costs relating to the new oce in 2010.
The directors consider that the adjusted earnings per share represent a more consistent measure of underlying performance.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The Group has prepared financial forecasts for the business for the period to June 2013 which show that the group as a whole will remain highly profitable and cash generative.
Within the forecast, the revenue streams which belong to HLPD continue to grow.
HLPD is profit making and has a net assets position as at 30 June 2011, therefore the directors see no reason to impair the value of goodwill and continue to hold it at its carrying amount.

Share-based payments Equity - settled share option scheme The Group seeks to facilitate significant equity ownership by employees, principally through schemes which encourage and assist the purchase of the Companys shares.
"The Group operates four share option plans: the Employee Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE, the Hargreaves Lansdown plc Share Incentive Plan SIP, the Hargreaves Lansdown Company Share Option Scheme the Executive Option Scheme"" and the Hargreaves Lansdown Joint Share Ownership Plan JSOP."
Awards granted under the Employee SAYE scheme vest over five years.
Awards granted under the Employee Share Incentive Plan vest over a three-year period.
Awards granted under the Executive Option Scheme vest between nil and ten years.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
There are currently no performance conditions attached to any options granted under any of the schemes, although options are forfeited in most circumstances if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Interests in shares purchased under the JSOP were settled at under market value, with tax and National Insurance being paid on the dierence.
The shares must be held for a minimum of three years under the terms of the Deeds and are realisable in only very limited circumstances before that date.
There are no performance conditions attached to the shares.
The recognition and measurement principles in IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 July 2005.
They have not been applied to any grants made prior to 7 November 2002.

Similarly, share price volatility was estimated as the average of the volatility experienced by a comparable group of quoted companies.
Since 15 May 2007, a quoted market price has been available for the Companys shares.
The Group recognised total expenses related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions as shown in note 7.

Related party transactions The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries, and with its directors and members of the Executive Committee the key management personnel.
Transactions between the Group and its key management personnel are disclosed below.
Details of transactions between the Group and other related parties are also disclosed below.
Trading transactions The Group entered into the following transactions with directors and related parties who are not members of the Group: During the years ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 the Group has been party to a lease with P K Hargreaves and S P Lansdown, who are both directors of the Company, for the rental of the old head oce premises at Kendal House.
Previously the rental was 302,400 per annum for the whole building but as from 6 April 2011 a new ten year lease was signed for a rental of part of the building, to be used for disaster recovery purposes at a rental of 105,000 per annum.
No amount was outstanding at either year end.
Following the move to the new oce in February 2010, notice was given to terminate the lease on Kendal House.
As part of the termination from that lease, an exit fee of 150,000 and 215,000 in dilapidation costs were paid in the year ended 30 June 2011.
Both amounts had been fully accrued for in the Group accounts for the year ended 30 June 2010.
Both amounts ultimately went to P K Hargreaves and S P Lansdown.
On 31 March 2011 Hargreaves Lansdown plc sold 10% of the ordinary share capital it held in its subsidiary undertaking Library Information Services Limited LIS.
The shares were sold to Stuart Louden the founder director of LIS and currently the only other shareholder, who is an employee of Hargreaves Lansdown Asset Management Limited.
The price paid per share was 671.
There is no readily available market for these shares and hence a valuation was arrived at based on the book value of the business discounted by 25% to allow for the lack of market for these shares.
The directors of Hargreaves Lansdown plc deemed this to be a fair price in the circumstances.
The total amount paid was 67,100 and this was settled immediately in cash.
Following the share sale Hargreaves Lansdown plc now holds 75% of the ordinary share capital in LIS and Stuart Louden holds 25%.
The transaction was completed in order to provide further incentive to Stuart Louden to successfully develop the business of LIS.
Hargreaves Lansdown plc retains control of LIS which continues to be accounted for as a subsidiary.
During the years ended 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 the Group has provided a range of investment services to shareholders, directors and sta on normal third party business terms.

Financial instruments Fair value The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially dierent from their carrying values.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, and available-for-sale financial assets where there is a quoted market price.
Investments in equity instruments which do not have a quoted market price in an active market or whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost which the directors believe is not signicantly dierent to fair value.
Fair value hierarchy The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which fair value is observable: Level 1 - Fair value measured using unadjusted quoted market prices Level 2 - Fair value measured using inputs derived from observable market data Level 3 - Fair value measured using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on observable market data Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 At 30 June 2011 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 350 -- 350 Available-for-sale financial assets 1,149 - 741 1,890 1,499 - 741 2,240 At 30 June 2010 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 471 -- 471 Available-for-sale financial assets 1,110 - 741 1,851 1,581 - 741 2,322 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 during the year.
Nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments a Financial risk management Financial assets principally comprise trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and current asset listed and unlisted investments.
Financial liabilities comprise certain provisions and trade and other payables.
The main risks arising from financial instruments are market risk including interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk, liquidity risk, and credit risk.
Each of these risks is discussed in detail below.
The Group monitors financial risks on a consolidated basis.
Hargreaves Lansdowns financial risk management is based upon sound economic objectives and good corporate practice.
No hedging transactions have taken place during the years presented.
The Group has designed a framework to manage the risks of its business and to ensure that the Directors have in place risk management practices appropriate to a listed company.
The management of risk within the Group is governed by the Board.
b Market risk Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses from adverse movements in interest bearing assets.
There is an exposure to interest rates on banking deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2011 the value of financial instruments on the Group balance sheet exposed to interest rate risk was 121,951,000 2010: 71,245,000 comprising cash and cash equivalents.
A 100bps 1% move in interest rates, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
This exposure is continually monitored to ensure that the Group is maximising its interest earning potential within accepted liquidity and credit constraints.
The Group has no external borrowings and as such is not exposed to interest rate or renancing risk on borrowings.
Cash at bank earns interest at oating rates based on daily bank deposit rates.
Short term deposits are also made for varying periods of between one day and 12 months depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group and earn interest at the respective xed term deposit rates.
As a source of revenue is based on the value of client cash under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to interest rate risk on cash balances held for clients.
These balances are not on the Group balance sheet.

Financial instruments continued Foreign exchange translation and transaction risk Foreign currency risk is the risk that the Group will sustain losses through adverse movements in currency exchange rates.
With substantially all of the Group's businesses located within the UK, and therefore with minimal net assets and transactions of the Group denominated in foreign currencies, the Group is not exposed to significant foreign exchange translation or transaction risk and as such does not hedge any foreign current assets or liabilities.
The Group deals in foreign currencies on a matched basis on behalf of clients, limiting foreign exchange exposure.
Price risk Price risk is the risk that a decline in the value of assets adversely impacts on the profitability of the Group as a result of an asset not meeting its expected value.
The Group is exposed to price risk on corporate investments held on the Group balance sheet.
At 30 June 2011, the fair value of investments recognised on the Group balance sheet was 2,240,000 2010: 2,322,000.
A 20% move in equity prices, in isolation, would not have a material impact on the Group balance sheet or results.
As a main source of revenue is based on the value of client assets under administration, the Group has an indirect exposure to security price risk on investments held for clients.
These assets are not on the Group balance sheet.
The risk of lower revenues is partially mitigated by asset class diversication.
The Group does not hedge its revenue exposure to movements in the value of client assets arising from these risks, and so the interests of the Group are aligned to those of its clients.
In addition, the Group acts as a private client investment manager, unit trust manager and agency stockbroker on a matched basis so its exposure to market price movements in this capacity is limited to when there is a trade mismatch or error, or if one matched counterparty fails to full its obligations.
The impact of these risks is minimised c Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, namely the risk that it may be unable to meet its payment obligations as they fall due.
The Group is highly cash generative and holds significant liquid assets.
The Group actively maintains cash balances on short-term deposit to ensure that the Group has sucient available funds for operations.
The table below analyses the maturities of the undiscounted cash ows relating to financial liabilities of the Group based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date at the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments continued d Credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk as credit exposure is spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Within the Groups Stockbroking operation, the Group is exposed to credit risk from counterparties to a securities transaction during the period between the trade date and the settlement date.
This period is generally three business days.
The Group has credit exposure that extends beyond the original settlement date if the counterparty fails either to make payment or to deliver securities.
These transactions are with financial institutions and clients.
Settlement risk is substantially mitigated as a result of the delivery versus payment mechanism whereby if a counterparty fails to make payment, the securities would not be delivered to the counterparty.
In that instance, the securities could be sold in the market and therefore the economic substance of the transaction is that securities serve as collateral in the case of delivery versus payment trade debtors.
As a result, the risk exposure is eectively to an adverse movement in market prices between the time of trade and settlement.
Other credit risk within the Group is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and the majority represents balances due from other regulated financial institutions where there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and institution.
Credit risk is therefore considered to be limited.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identied loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
Cash is held with UK banks.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies and since November 2008 the banks consist of certain eligible banks under the UK Government Credit Guarantee Scheme.
The Group takes a conservative approach to treasury management and selection of banking counterparties, and carries out a regular review of all its banks and custodians credit ratings.

Total capital at 30 June 2011 was 130,867,000 2010: 66,053,000 and this capital is managed via the net assets to which it relates.
Regulatory capital is determined in accordance with the requirements of the Capital Requirements Directive prescribed in the UK by the Financial Services Authority FSA, and the Groups regulatory capital is divided into two tiers: Tier 1 capital, which is the total of issued share capital, retained earnings and reserves created by appropriations of retained earnings, net of the book value of goodwill and other intangible assets: and Tier 2 capital, which is unrealised gains arising on the fair valuation of equity instruments held as available-for-sale.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are i to comply with the regulatory capital requirements set by the FSA: ii to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benets for other stakeholders: and iii to maintain a strong capital base to support the development of its business.
All regulated entities within the Group are required to meet the Pillar 1 regulatory Capital Resources Requirements CRR set out in the Capital Requirements Directive the Directive.
The CRR is the higher of i the xed overhead requirement and ii the sum of the credit risk capital requirement and the market risk capital requirement.
The Group is also required to comply with the requirements of the Directive under Pillar 2 Operational Risk and Pillar 3 Disclosure in respect of the Groups regulatory capital requirements.
The Directive requires continual assessment of the Groups risks in order to ensure that the higher of Pillar 1 and 2 requirements is met, the objective being to ensure that the regulated rms have adequate capital to enable them to manage their risks.
The Group completes its assessment of regulatory capital requirements using its Individual Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP under Pillar 2, which is a forward looking exercise that includes stress testing on major risks, such as a significant market downturn, and identifying mitigating action.
The ICAAP covers current as well as projected capital requirements, and is used to manage regulatory capital.
Under the requirements of Pillar 3, the Group is required to disclose regulatory capital information, and has done so by making the disclosures available in the Groups website at http: www.
All of the regulated rms maintained surplus regulated capital throughout the year.
The aggregated regulatory Pillar 1 capital surplus across the four regulated subsidiaries was approximately 46 million at 30 June 2011 2010: 42 million.
The regulated subsidiaries are limited in the distributions that can be paid up to the parent by their individual capital requirements.
Capital adequacy and the use of regulatory capital are monitored by the Groups management.
