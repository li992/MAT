overview business review governance financial statements Interserve AnnuAl report 2011 fInAncIAl stAtements consolIDAteD notes 71 notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 BAsIs of prepArAtIon note The Interserve Plc consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and comply with the IFRS and related Interpretations SIC and IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union.
Adoption of new and revised standards In the current year the following standards were introduced, none of which materially impacted the Group.
IFRS 1 amended First-time adoption of IFRS limited exemptions from comparative IFRS 7 disclosures IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement IFRIC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments IAS 24 Related party disclosures amended Nov 2009 IFRS 7 amended Financial instruments: disclosures At the date of authorisation of these Group financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these Group financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial instruments IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements IFRS 11 Joint arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosures of interests in other entities IFRS 13 Fair value measurement IAS 19 revised Employee benefits IAS 27 Separate financial statements IAS 28 Investments in associates and joint ventures IAS 12 amended Deferred tax: recovery of underlying assets The impact of the sections of IFRS 9 currently issued will result in the Groups project finance interests that are currently treated by the joint-venture companies as being available-for-sale, being treated as a debt carried at fair value through profit or loss or amortised cost.
As a result, movements in the fair value will no longer be taken to Other comprehensive income.
The key impact of IAS 19 revised will be to remove the separate assumptions for expected return on plan assets and discounting of scheme liabilities, and replace them with one single discount rate for the net deficit.
This will have the impact of increasing the interest charge related to pensions.
Except for IFRS 9 and IAS 19 revised, listed above, the directors anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group.
critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty In the preparation of the consolidated financial statements management makes certain judgements and estimates that impact the financial statements.
While these judgements are continually reviewed the facts and circumstances underlying these judgements may change resulting in a change to the estimates that could impact the results of the Group.
In particular: Revenue and margin recognition The policy for revenue recognition on long-term and service contracts is set out in notes 1 d and e. Judgements are made on an ongoing basis with regard to the recoverability of amounts due and liabilities arising.
Regular forecasts are compiled on the outcomes of these types of contracts, which require assessments and judgements relating to the recovery of pre-contract costs, changes in work scopes, contract programmes and maintenance liabilities.
PFI financial assets and derivative financial instruments The Groups interests in PFI PPP investments are classified as available-for-sale financial assets by the joint-venture entities.
The fair value of these financial assets is measured at each balance sheet date by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset.
The discount rate used is based on long-term LIBOR plus a margin to reflect the risk associated with each project.
The Groups PFI PPP joint-venture and associate companies use derivative financial instruments to manage the interest rate and inflation rate risks to which the concessions are exposed within their long-term contractual agreements.
These derivatives are initially recognised as assets and liabilities at their fair value and subsequently remeasured at each balance sheet date at their fair value.
The fair value of derivatives, assessed by discounting future cash flows, constantly changes in response to prevailing market conditions.

In determining whether goodwill is impaired an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating unit CGU to which the goodwill has been allocated is required.
This calculation of value in use requires estimates to be made relating to the timing and amount of future cash flows expected from the CGU, and suitable discount rates based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the specific economic environment of the relevant CGU.
Retirement benefit obligations In accordance with IAS 19 Employee benefits, the Group has disclosed in note 28 the assumptions used in calculating the defined benefit obligations.
In the calculation a number of assumptions around future salary increases, increase in pension benefits, mortality rates, inflation, discount rates and the likely future return on scheme assets have been made.
Property, plant and equipment The rental fleet in Equipment Services has a carrying value of 102.7 million 2010: 110.0 million.
The great majority of equipment in the rental fleet is depreciated on a straight-line basis to a residual value of zero over 10 years.
Asset lives are reviewed regularly in light of technological change, prospective utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
Due to the transportable nature of the rental fleet, the review for potential impairment is performed on a global basis.
Carrying value of trade and other receivables Allowance for doubtful debt and provisions against other receivables, including amounts due on construction contracts and carrying value of accrued income, are made on a specific basis, based on estimates of irrecoverability determined by market knowledge and past experience.
AccountIng polIcIes Interserve Plc the Company is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and bound by the Companies Act 2006.
The consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out below.
These financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis.
As disclosed on page 29 the directors believe that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The significant accounting policies adopted by the directors are set out below and have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material to the Groups financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates and joint-venture entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively.
Minority interests in the net assets of the consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity interest therein.
Minority interests consist of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the minoritys share of the changes in equity since the date of the combination.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the associates, joint ventures and any newly acquired subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
When an entity has an accounting reference date other than 31 December, due to the influence of a co-shareholder or customer requirements, the consolidation includes management accounts, prepared using these Group accounting policies, drawn up for the year ended 31 December.
Where a Group company is party to a jointly-controlled operation, that company proportionately accounts for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows on a line-by-line basis.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
b Business combinations Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of acquisition, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquired company.
The acquired companys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are recognised at their fair value as at the acquisition date.
Before the adoption of IFRS 3 revised, the cost of acquisition included any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
Costs incurred on acquisitions completed since 1 January 2010, the date of adoption of the revision to IFRS 3, are expensed.

AccountIng polIcIes COnTInUED b Business combinations continued Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly-controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP value at that date, subject to being subsequently tested for impairment.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated undertakings.
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquired company is initially measured at the minorities proportion of the net fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
c foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
AccountIng polIcIes COnTInUED The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at the closing rate is taken directly to reserves.
d revenue Revenue comprises the fair value of goods and services supplied to external customers, the value of work executed in respect of provision of services and construction contracts and the rental and sale of equipment, excluding VAT.
Revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy on construction contracts see below.
non-construction revenue and investment revenue is recognised on an accruals basis.
e construction contracts Where the outcome of a contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activity at the balance sheet date.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is only recognised to the extent that it is probable that it will be recoverable.
Profit is only recognised on a construction contract when the final outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Expected losses are recognised immediately.
Stage of completion is determined by surveys of work performed by quantity surveyors in conjunction with clients.
f other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are stated at fair value less accumulated amortisation and any impairment losses, provided that the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition.
Operating software acquired as part of a related item of hardware is capitalised within property, plant and equipment along with the hardware acquired.
Other software licences acquired are capitalised, along with the cost to bring the software into use, within intangible assets.
Other intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight-line basis, typically between three and ten years.
g property, plant and equipment i Owned property, plant and equipment tangible fixed assets are carried at historical cost less any accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses.
Properties in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets over their expected useful lives.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line or reducing-balance basis at rates ranging between: Straight line Reducing balance Freehold land nil Freehold buildings 2% to 5% Leasehold property over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38% ii Property, plant and equipment held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.

AccountIng polIcIes COnTInUED h Impairment of tangible and other intangible assets The Group reviews, at least annually, the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets compared to their recoverable amounts to determine whether those assets have suffered an impairment loss see note 11.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
i Investments Investments are held at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Investments are financial assets and are classified as fair value through the profit or loss.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
j Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method.
net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
k Borrowing costs Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
l pfI bid costs and other pre-contract costs In the case of PFI bid costs, on financial close of the project the Group recovers bid costs by charging a fee to the relevant project company.
If the fee exceeds the amount held by the Group as an asset, the excess is credited to the balance sheet as deferred income and is released to the income statement over the construction period.
If the agreed fee is less than the amount held by the Group as an asset, the loss is recognised as soon as it is anticipated.
Other pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash inflows.
Virtual certainty of a contract award is a subjective assessment, but normally arises on appointment as preferred bidder or notification from the prospective customer of their intent to appoint Interserve.
m leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are reflected in the income statement.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
n provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Where the Group expects some or all of a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain.
The expense relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net of any reimbursement.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using an appropriate rate that takes into account the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.

AccountIng polIcIes COnTInUED o financial instruments Trade receivables Trade receivables are initially measured at fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Trade receivables are financial assets and classified as loans and receivables.
Cash and deposits Cash and deposits comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash and deposits are financial assets and are classified as loans and receivables.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Bank borrowings are other financial liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk management purposes only.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is taken out and subsequently remeasured at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that are designated as, and effective as, hedges of future cash flows and net investments are recognised directly in the other comprehensive income statement.
Any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts deferred in equity are recycled through the income statement in the same period in which the underlying hedged item is recognised in the income statement.
However, when the transaction that is being hedged results in a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of that asset or liability.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity at that time is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, any cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement for the period.
Changes in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting, or have not been designated as hedges, are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
These derivative instruments are designated as fair value through the profit or loss FVTPL.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their economic risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value.
p share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 november 2002 that were unvested as at 1 January 2004.
The Group issues share-based payments to certain employees.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used to value the share option plans and the Sharesave Scheme.
A stochastic model has been used to value the Performance Share Plan.

AccountIng polIcIes COnTInUED q pfI projects Treatment on consolidation The Groups investments in PFI jointly-controlled entities Joint ventures PFI Investments are accounted for under the equity method.
Treatment in the underlying joint-venture entity The joint-venture entities have determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts.
The balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets is not borne by the entities, and therefore the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset and is classified as available-for-sale.
Income is recognised on PFI projects both as operating revenue and interest income: a proportion of total cash receivable is allocated to operating revenue by means of a margin on service costs taking account of operational risks, and interest income on the financial asset is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
The residual element is allocated to the amortisation of the financial asset.
The fair value of the financial asset is measured at each balance sheet date by computing the discounted future value of the cash flow allocated to the financial asset.
Discount rates are determined using long-term interest rates, subject to a floor, plus risk factors specific to individual projects.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised directly in equity until the asset is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the income statement for the period.
r pensions The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff.
For the defined benefit schemes the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised directly in equity and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the income statement is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
s taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated at the rates at which they are likely to reverse in the tax jurisdiction to which they relate.
Deferred tax is provided in full on temporary differences which arise between the carrying value of an asset or liability and its tax base.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient profits in the future to enable the assets to be utilised and reviewed at least annually.
Deferred tax liabilities are normally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax is charged credited to the income statement except to the extent that the underlying asset or liability is credited charged to equity in which case the deferred tax follows that treatment to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
t exceptional items Exceptional items are those that the Group consider to be non-recurring and significant in size or in nature.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, cash flows, growth rates and margins during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The revenue growth rates are based on current Board approved budgets and forecasts and are extrapolated based on expectations of changes in the market.
The Group produces three-year plans and then projects a further year based on growth rates of 2.5%, followed by a terminal value based on a perpetuity calculated at a nominal 2.5% growth which does not exceed current market growth rates.
The rate used to discount the future cash flows is 13.0% 2010: 12.2% and is based on the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
As part of this annual review a sensitivity analysis was performed on the impairment test of each CGU, including an increase in the discount rate of up to 2.0% or the limiting of growth over the plan years to 2.5%.
no impairment in the carrying value of the goodwill in either Support Servcies or Equipment Services would occur as a result of adopting these sensitivities.

Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Group has secured long-term refinancing see note 32.
The majority of the Groups borrowings bear interest at floating rates which are set according to published LIBOR rates.
The remainder bear interest at rates that are determined by bank base rates.
The Group has access to committed borrowing facilities that expire in one to two years.
Amounts are drawn down against these facilities on a short-term basis but the ageing of the total amount borrowed is classified according to the maturity of the facilities.
Contractual interest on bank loans, that will accrue between the year end and the date of rollover of the amounts drawn down, is 0.4 million and is all due for payment within one year 2010: 0.9 million within one year.

Financial assets and liabilities have fair values not materially different to the carrying values.
Financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables excluding construction contracts, accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security, bank borrowings, finance leases, loan notes, long-term creditors and interest rate hedges.
The Group has the following categories of financial assets and liabilities: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 million million Loans and receivables Cash and deposits 46.1 67.6 Trade and other receivables excluding construction contracts, 235.7 226.8 prepaid and accrued income Total financial assets 281.8 294.4 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Other Derivatives Other Derivatives financial used for financial used for liabilities hedging Total liabilities hedging Total million million million million million million Bank loans and overdrafts and finance leases 90.3 90.3 121.4 121.4 Trade and other payables excluding construction contracts, 222.6 222.6 225.7 225.7 accruals, deferred income and other tax and social security Interest rate hedge non-PFI investments 1.8 1.8 2.2 2.2 Total financial liabilities 132.3 1.8 134.1 104.3 2.2 106.5 Trade and other receivables and trade and other payables are held at amortised cost.
The directors consider these values to approximate their fair values.
The interest rate hedges are held at fair value at each balance sheet date.
Financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value are grouped into three levels based on the degree to which the fair value is observable, as defined by IFRS 7 paragraph 27: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Classification of financial assets liabilities held at fair value according to the definitions set out in IFRS 7 paragraph 27: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 million million Level 2 1.8 2.2 Derivatives used for hedging financial liabilities are considered to be within the grouping referred to as Level 2.
Their fair values are calculated based on the valuation models operated by the relevant counterparty bank, based on market interest rates in force on the date of valuation.
no financial instruments have been transferred between Levels during the year.
Exposure to credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is managed by the Groups requirement to trade with counterparties with strong credit ratings as determined by international credit rating agencies.
The transactional banking requirements are met by local banks in each location with significant cash balances being remitted to Group treasury where short-term cash surpluses or cash not available for use by the Group is deposited with investment grade rated banks.

Gains and losses arising on retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of individual Group companies are recognised in the income statement.
The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to manage material currency exposures that arise on cashflows from sales or purchases not denominated in functional currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted.
Taking into account the effect of forward contracts, Group companies did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 December 2011.
The Group does not hedge anticipated future sales and purchases.
Gains and losses arising on the retranslation of foreign operations net assets into the consolidation currency are recognised directly in equity.
The Group does not hedge these translation differences.
The Groups exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates is shown below where a change in value of foreign currencies against sterling would have the following impact on the results of the Group: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 million million A 1% change in exchange rates results in: Change in profit 0.2 0.3 Change in reserves net assets 1.5 1.4 96 96 96 Interser Interser Interserve Annu five Annu five AnnuA A Al l l r r repor epor eport 2011 t 2011 t 2011 f f fIIIn n nA A Anc nc ncIA IA IAl l l st st stA A Atements tements tements consolIDAteD notes N No ot te es t s to t o th he C e Con ons so ol lid ida at te ed F d Fi in na an nc cia ial S l St ta at te em me en nt ts s co con nt tiin nue ued d 20. fInAncIAl rIsk mAnAgement COnTInUED b market price risk interest rate hedges The Group seeks to control its exposure to changes in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to limit the impact on the interest charge in the income statement.
Contracts in place at the year end were as follows: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Nominal Nominal value value million Maturity Strike price million Maturity Strike price Interest rate swaps Current 20.0 2012 3.62% Current 20.0 2012 3.62% Current 30.0 2013 3.56% Current 30.0 2013 3.56% The fair value of interest rate hedges at 31 December 2011 is estimated at 1.8 million 2010: 2.2 million.
The contracts are designated as cash flow hedges and to the extent that the hedges are effective hedges, changes in their fair value are recognised directly in equity.
The fair values of the hedge instruments are calculated based on the valuation computer models operated by the relevant counterparty bank valuation models.
no charges have gone through the income statement in the year 2010: nil in respect of changes in the fair value of the hedges.
A gain of 1.1 million 2010: loss of 0.6 million was credited through other comprehensive income in respect to changes in fair value of the hedges.
The use of interest rate caps and swaps, where appropriate, diminishes the impact of an interest rate change.
The impact of a 1% change in interest rate to the Groups results is shown in the table below: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 million million A 1% change in interest rate results in: Change in profit c credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, trade and other receivables and investments, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
To manage this risk, credit references are taken and where appropriate parent company guarantees are sought along with monthly monitoring of age and recoverability of trade receivables.
Apart from receivables due from customers related to HM Government, the Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
d liquidity risk The Group seeks to maintain sufficient facilities to ensure that it has access to funding to meet current and anticipated future funding requirements determined from budgets and medium-term plans.
The maturity of financial assets and liabilities, with the exception of interest rate hedges above, are discussed in the specific asset and liability notes.
e capital risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns, whilst seeking to optimise the debt and equity balance, in order to maximise the return to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes cash, deposits and borrowings note 19, and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent.
The Group has, over recent years, had a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders.
The Group may adjust the capital structure of the Group by returning capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements but is subject to covenants in its loan agreements which seek to maintain the level of debt and interest that the Group may service at reasonable levels by reference to the Groups earnings which ultimately limits the amount of debt that the Group can take on.

The scheme involves employees saving a set amount from their salary for a period of three years.
At the end of the three-year period the employee is offered the opportunity to purchase shares based on the amount saved at an option price set at the start of the period.
The option price is set at a 10% discount of the average share price over five days trading prior to the offer date of the scheme.

DefIneD BenefIt retIrement schemes The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee benefits.
For each of these pension schemes, valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the various schemes as at 31 December 2009.
As permitted by IAS 19, actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside profit or loss and presented in other comprehensive income.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the various defined benefit obligations, as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method.
In February 2011, the RMD Ireland Pension Scheme was closed to future accrual of benefit and as a result a 0.4 million curtailment gain has been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2011.
The following table sets out the key IAS 19 assumptions used to assess the present value of the defined benefit obligation: 2011 2010 2009 Retail price inflation 3.10% pa 3.40% pa 3.50% pa 2.10% pa Consumer price index 2.80% pa n a Discount rate 4.80% pa 5.40% pa 5.60% pa Pension increases in payment: LPI RPI 3.00% 3.10% 3.30% 3.40% 3.40% 3.50% Fixed 5% 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% 3% or RPI if higher capped at 5% 3.60% 3.70% 3.70% 3.85-4.60% pa General salary increases 4.15-4.90% pa 4.25-5.00% pa The expected rate of return is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the pension schemes were invested in at 31 December 2010 and making a deduction of 0.4% 2010: 0.4% pa for the expenses incurred in running the schemes where these are not met separately.
For the Interserve Pension Scheme, which represents the majority of plan assets, the expected rate of return on assets during 2011 net of expenses was 6.0% pa 2010: 6.0% pa.
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation allows for future improvements in mortality and implies for the majority of the obligation that associated with the Interserve Pension Scheme that a 65-year-old current pensioner is expected to live until age: male 86.0 2010: age 85.9 and female 87.9 2010: age 87.9.
A future pensioner who is currently aged 45 and retires at age 65 is expected to live until age: male 87.8 2010: age 87.7 and female 89.1 2010: age 89.0. overview business review governance financial statements Interserve AnnuAl report 2011 fInAncIAl stAtements consolIDAteD notes 103 28.
