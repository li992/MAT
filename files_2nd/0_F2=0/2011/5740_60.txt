Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements in accordance with the licence agreements the group is liable for site restoration, clean up and abandonment of the wells upon completion of their production cycle.
The provision for future site restoration relates to obligations to restore the oilfields after use.
All of these costs are expected to be incurred at the end of the life of wells between 2027 and 2038 Note 5.
They depend on the estimated lives of the wells, the scale of any possible contamination and the timing and extent of corrective actions.
The unwinding of the discount related to future site restoration and abandonment reserve is included within finance costs.
Management believes that this estimate of the future liability is appropriate to the size of the fields.
