The reductions to 26 per cent effective from April 1, 2011 and 25 per cent effective from April 1, 2012 were substantively enacted on March 29, 2011 and July 5, 2011 respectively.
As the rate change to 25 per cent was substantively enacted prior to the year end, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at this rate.
The resulting charges or credits have been recognised in the income statement except to the extent that they relate to items previously charged or credited to OCI or equity.
Accordingly, in 2011, 11m has been credited to the income statement, 5m has been charged to the OCI and 3m has been charged directly to equity.
Had the further tax rate changes been substantively enacted on or before the balance sheet date it would have had the effect of reducing the deferred tax asset by 23m and reducing the deferred tax liability by 22m.
There are no unrecognised deferred tax liabilities arising on the aggregate temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and joint ventures 2010: nil.
Any withholding tax due on the remittance of future earnings is expected to be insignificant.
