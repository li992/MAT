Financial instruments Market risk analysis 181 IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant market risk variables on the Groups profit and shareholders equity.
The periodic effects are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in the risk variables to the balance of financial instruments at the reporting date.
The Groups primary market exposures are to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.
Interest rate risk 2011 The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of exposures to movements in the LIBOR.
It is the Groups preference to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest, notwithstanding that some borrowings are at fixed rates.
In addition, a limited amount of fixed rate hedging may be undertaken 243 during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant.
In keeping with the Groups preference to borrow at floating rates of interest, the following interest rate swap contracts were outstanding at 31 December 2011 and 2010: Principal Average Fair Principal Average Fair amount rate % value amount rate % value 6,000 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 US$m 6,243 At fair value: Interest rate swap from US$ fixed rates: Maturing in less than 1 year 9 925 1.44 36 2,255 1.26 78 Maturing between 1and 2 years 925 1.11 73 Due within Due between Due between Due between Due between Due after 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total Maturing between 3 and 4 years 1 1,430 2.29 171 Maturing between 4 and 5 years 1 1,000 1.35 177 1,439 1.95 143 Maturing greater than 5 years 1 1,660 2.31 314 2,660 1.65 346 1,852 1,852 Interest rate swap to US$ fixed rates: 3,742 1 1,249 4,992 Maturing in less than 1 year 1 100 4.54 2 Maturing between 1and 2 years 100 4.54 6 96 1 171 177 331 776 5 5,115 2.00 696 7,379 1.56 634 5,690 1 171 178 1,580 7,620 Relates to the Unsecured notes and Senior debentures refer to note 28.
