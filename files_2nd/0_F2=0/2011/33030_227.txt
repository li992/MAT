Provisions continued Therefore, for the purposes of calculating a provision for fines and penalties under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act, BP has continued to use an estimate of 3.2 million barrels of oil discharged to the Gulf of Mexico as its current best estimate, as dened in paragraphs 36-40 of IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, of the amount which may be used in calculating the penalty under Section 311 of the Clean Water Act.
This reects an estimate of total ow from the well of approximately 4 million barrels, and an estimate of barrels captured by vessels on the surface, currently estimated at 811,000 barrels.
In utilizing this estimate, BP has taken into consideration not only its own analysis of the ow and discharge issue, but also the analyses and conclusions of other parties, including the US government.
The estimate of BP and of other parties as to how much oil was discharged to the Gulf of Mexico may change, perhaps materially, over time.
Changes in estimates as to ow and discharge could affect the amount actually assessed for Clean Water Act fines and penalties.
The year-end provision continued to be based on a per-barrel penalty of $1,100 for the reasons discussed above, including BPs continued conclusion that it did not act with gross negligence or engage in wilful misconduct.
The amount and timing of these costs will depend upon what is ultimately determined to be the volume of oil spilled and the per-barrel penalty rate that is imposed.
It is not currently practicable to estimate the timing of expending these costs and the provision has been included within non-current liabilities on the balance sheet.
No other amounts have been provided as at 31 December 2011 in relation to other potential fines and penalties because it is not possible to measure the obligation reliably.
Fines and penalties are not covered by the trust fund.
Pensions and other post-retirement benets Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benets of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets may be provided through dened contribution plans money purchase plans or dened benefit plans final salary and other types of plans with committed pension payments.
For dened contribution plans, retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For dened benefit plans, retirement benets are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Dened benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
In particular, the primary pension arrangement in the UK is a funded final salary pension plan under which retired employees draw the majority of their benefit as an annuity.
With effect from 1 April 2010, BP closed its UK plan to new joiners other than some of those joining the North Sea business.
The plan remains open to ongoing accrual for those employees who had joined BP on or before 31 March 2010.
The majority of new joiners in the UK have the option to join a dened contribution plan.
In the US, a range of retirement arrangements is provided.
This includes a funded final salary pension plan for certain heritage employees and a cash balance arrangement for new hires.
Retired US employees typically take their pension benefit in the form of a lump sum payment.
US employees are also eligible to participate in a dened contribution 401k plan in which employee contributions are matched with company contributions.
The level of contributions to funded dened benefit plans is the amount needed to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
During 2011, contributions of $429 million 2010 $411 million and 2009 $9 million and $777 million 2010 $694 million and 2009 $795 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $223 million 2010 $188 million and 2009 $204 million were made to other funded dened benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2012 is expected to be approximately $1,250 million, and includes contributions in all countries that we expect to be required to make by law or under contractual agreements as well as an allowance for discretionary funding.
Certain group companies, principally in the US, provide post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets to their retired employees and dependants.
The entitlement to these benets is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The obligation and cost of providing pensions and other post-retirement benets is assessed annually using the projected unit credit method.
The date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2011.
The groups principal plans are subject to a formal actuarial valuation every three years in the UK, with valuations being required more frequently in many other countries.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the UK pension plans was as at 31 December 2008.
The material financial assumptions used for estimating the benefit obligations of the various plans are set out below.
The assumptions are reviewed by management at the end of each year, and are used to evaluate accrued pension and other post-retirement benets at 31 December.
The same assumptions are used to determine pension and other post-retirement benefit expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2011 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension expense for 2012.

The ination rate assumptions for our UK and US plans are based on the difference between the yields on index-linked and xed-interest long-term government bonds.
In other countries we use either this approach, or the central bank ination target, or advice from the local actuary depending on the information that is available to us.
The ination rate assumptions are used to determine the rate of increase for pensions in payment and the rate of increase in deferred pensions where there is such an increase.
234 BP Annual Report and Form 20-F 2011 Financial statements Notes on financial statements 37.
Pensions and other post-retirement benets continued Our assumptions for the rate of increase in salaries are based on our ination rate assumption plus an allowance for expected long-term real salary growth.
These include allowance for promotion-related salary growth, of between 0.3% and 0.4% depending on country.
In addition to the financial assumptions, we regularly review the demographic and mortality assumptions.
The mortality assumptions reect best practice in the countries in which we provide pensions, and have been chosen with regard to the latest available published tables adjusted where appropriate to reect the experience of the group and an extrapolation of past longevity improvements into the future.
BPs most substantial pension liabilities are in the UK, the US and Germany where our mortality assumptions are as follows: Years Mortality assumptions UK US Germany 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Life expectancy at age 60 for a 27.6 24.8 23.5 male currently aged 60 26.1 26.0 24.7 24.6 23.3 23.2 Life expectancy at age 60 for a male currently aged 40 30.5 29.1 29.0 26.3 26.2 26.1 26.3 26.2 26.1 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 60 29.3 28.7 28.6 26.4 26.3 26.3 28.0 27.9 27.8 Life expectancy at age 60 for a female currently aged 40 32.0 31.6 31.5 27.3 27.2 27.2 30.7 30.6 30.4 Our assumption for future US healthcare cost trend rate for the first year after the reporting date reects the rate of actual cost increases seen in recent years.
The ultimate trend rate reects our long-term expectations of the level at which cost ination will stabilize based on past healthcare cost ination seen over a longer period of time.
The assumed future US healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are as follows: % 2011 2010 2009 First years US healthcare cost trend rate 7.6 7.8 8.0 Ultimate US healthcare cost trend rate 5.0 5.0 5.0 Year in which ultimate trend rate is reached 2020 2018 2016 Pension plan assets are generally held in trusts.
The primary objective of the trusts is to accumulate pools of assets sufficient to meet the obligations of the various plans.
The assets of the trusts are invested in a manner consistent with duciary obligations and principles that reect current practices in portfolio management.
A significant proportion of the assets are held in equities, owing to a higher expected level of return over the long term with an acceptable level of risk.
In order to provide reasonable assurance that no single security or type of security has an unwarranted impact on the total portfolio, the investment portfolios are highly diversied.
The long-term asset allocation policy for the major plans is as follows: UK US Other Asset category %%% Total equity 73 70 17-63 Bonds cash 20 30 25-75 Property real estate 7 0-10 Some of the groups pension plans use derivative financial instruments as part of their asset mix and to manage the level of risk.
The groups main pension plans do not invest directly in either securities or property real estate of the company or of any subsidiary.
Return on asset assumptions reect the groups expectations built up by asset class and by plan.
The groups expectation is derived from a combination of historical returns over the long term and the forecasts of market professionals.
Our assumption for return on equities is based on a long-term view, and the size of the resulting equity risk premium over government bond yields is reviewed each year for reasonableness.
Our assumption for return on bonds reects the portfolio mix of government xed-interest, index-linked and corporate bonds.

Pensions and other post-retirement benets continued The expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of assets held by the dened benefit plans at 31 December are set out below.
The market values shown include the effects of derivative financial instruments.
The amounts classied as equities include investments in companies listed on stock exchanges as well as unlisted investments.
Movements in the value of plan assets during the year are shown in detail in the table on page 238.
The market value of private equity investments at 31 December 2011 was $4,099 million 2010 $3,348 million and 2009 $2,956 million.
The equity return assumption shown above is the weighted average of the assumed returns for listed and private equity investments in each fund.
Comparative return assumptions for the US pension plans equities have been restated to reect this.
Equity return assumptions previously disclosed reected the assumption for listed equities only.
