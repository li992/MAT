2 Act 2010 enacted a reduction in the UK Corporation Tax rate from 28% to 27% with effect from April 2011.
On 23 March 2011 the UK Government announced that the Corporation Tax rate would reduce to 26% from April 2011, with three further annual 1% cuts to 23% by April 2014.
Other than the change to 26%, which became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011, the effects of the announced changes are not reflected in these financial statements as they were either substantively enacted after the balance sheet date or they have not yet been enacted and, in each case, the impact has not yet been estimated.
