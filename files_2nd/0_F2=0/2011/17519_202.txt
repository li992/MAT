Financial instruments Market risk analysis 181 IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant market risk variables on the Groups profit and shareholders equity.
The periodic effects are determined by relating the hypothetical changes in the risk variables to the balance of financial instruments at the reporting date.
The Groups primary market exposures are to interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and commodity price risk.
Interest rate risk 2011 The Group is exposed to interest rate risk primarily as a result of exposures to movements in the LIBOR.
It is the Groups preference to borrow and invest at floating rates of interest, notwithstanding that some borrowings are at fixed rates.
In addition, a limited amount of fixed rate hedging may be undertaken 243 during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short-term interest rates is more significant.
In keeping with the Groups preference to borrow at floating rates of interest, the following interest rate swap contracts were outstanding at 31 December 2011 and 2010: Principal Average Fair Principal Average Fair amount rate % value amount rate % value 6,000 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 US$m 6,243 At fair value: Interest rate swap from US$ fixed rates: Maturing in less than 1 year 9 925 1.44 36 2,255 1.26 78 Maturing between 1and 2 years 925 1.11 73 Due within Due between Due between Due between Due between Due after 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total Maturing between 3 and 4 years 1 1,430 2.29 171 Maturing between 4 and 5 years 1 1,000 1.35 177 1,439 1.95 143 Maturing greater than 5 years 1 1,660 2.31 314 2,660 1.65 346 1,852 1,852 Interest rate swap to US$ fixed rates: 3,742 1 1,249 4,992 Maturing in less than 1 year 1 100 4.54 2 Maturing between 1and 2 years 100 4.54 6 96 1 171 177 331 776 5 5,115 2.00 696 7,379 1.56 634 5,690 1 171 178 1,580 7,620 Relates to the Unsecured notes and Senior debentures refer to note 28.

Interest on financial 547 7.9437 20 instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
IFRS 7 requires interest rate sensitivity analysis that shows the effects of changes in market interest rates on the income statement and, if appropriate, shareholders equity.
The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: for non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rate terms, a change in market interest rates only affects income if these are measured at their fair value.
Consequently, all non-derivative financial instruments with fixed interest rate terms that are carried at amortised cost are excluded from this analysis with the exception of those subject to a fixed to floating rate swap : items subject to an effective fixed to floating interest rate swap hedge are assumed to be floating instruments for the purpose of this analysis: for floating rate instruments, income statement impacts assume adjustments to interest income and expense for a 12-month period:
