Of these amounts, Schoolnet contributed 15m of sales and a loss of 2m, EDI contributed 17m of sales and 5m of profit and Connections contributed 24m of sales and 6m of profit.
As Global Education was acquired late in December 2011 it did not contribute a significant amount of sales or profit in 2011.
If the acquisitions had completed on 1 January 2011, the Group estimates that sales for the period would have been 6,042m and profit before tax would have been 1,163m.
