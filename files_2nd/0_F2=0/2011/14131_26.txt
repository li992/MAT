100 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2011 32 Financial instruments continued f Financial risk factors continued Other loans include index-linked debt with maturities up to 56 years.
The principal is revalued at fixed intervals and is linked to movements in the retail price index.
Interest payments are made biannually based on the revalued principal.
The principal repayment equals the revalued amount at maturity.
The calculations above are based on forward inflation rates at the balance sheet date.
Derivative financial instruments analysed by maturity date The following table details the groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments.
The tables are based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative financial instruments that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates derived from the forward curves existing at the balance sheet date.
Actual amounts may be significantly different from those indicated below.

Hedge accounting is adopted for such instruments where the criteria set out in IAS 39 are met.
i Fair value hedges The group raises debt denominated in currencies other than sterling principally Japanese Yen and Euro.
Cross currency swaps are entered into at the time that the debt is drawn down to swap the proceeds into sterling debt bearing interest based on LIBOR in order to mitigate the groups exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
The terms of the receivable leg of the swap closely match the terms of the underlying debt hence the swaps are expected to be effective hedges.
At the year end the amounts of cross currency swaps designated as fair value hedges were as follows: Notional principal amount Fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m US dollar 27.0 27.0 6.6 7.7 Euro 11.4 548.0 6.0 90.2 Yen 103.3 161.0 60.8 66.9 Czech krona 47.2 47.2 24.7 22.5 188.9 783.2 98.1 187.3 Financial statements 102 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the group financial statements continued For the year ended 31 March 2011 32 Financial instruments continued g Hedge accounting continued ii Cash flow hedges The group has entered into interest rate swaps under which it has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on future cash flow exposures arising from issued variable rate debt.
The group also entered into a number of interest rate contracts with future start dates during the AMP5 regulatory period.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on debt which is highly probable to be issued over the AMP5 period to fund Severn Trent Waters capital programme and have been accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the balance sheet date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the yield curve prevailing at the balance sheet date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
The interest rate swaps primarily settle net on a biannual basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is six months LIBOR.
Details of interest rate swaps that have been accounted for as cash flow hedges are summarised below.

Awards are subject to performance conditions and continued employment throughout the vesting period.
Awards have been made on different bases to Severn Trent Plc and Severn Trent Water employees the LTIP and to Severn Trent Services employees the Services LTIP.
During the year awards over 141,111 shares 2010: 163,421 shares with a fair value of 7.91 2010: 5.41 were made to 20 employees 2010: 21 employees under the LTIP.
The LTIP awards are subject to total shareholder return over three years relative to the companies ranked 51 150 by market capitalisation in the FTSE index excluding investment trusts.
The Services LTIP awards vest in three equal tranches which are subject to achievement of turnover and profit targets in the years ending 31 March 2011, 2012 and 2013.

For the July 2010 LTIP award and the July 2009 award the comparator group is the group of companies ranked 51 150 in the FTSE index excluding investment trusts.
The volatility of the comparator companies, the correlation between Severn Trent and the comparator companies, and performance over the portion of the performance period that had elapsed at the date of grant was taken into account when modelling the TSR performance condition.
The share price at the grant date was 12.28 2010: 11.34.
The vesting period commences before the grant date.
Performance in the vesting period prior to the grant date is taken into account in determining the fair value of the award.
Dividends paid on shares during the vesting period are accumulated during the vesting period and released subject to achievement of the performance condition in the same manner as the underlying shares.
As a result a dividend yield assumption is not required.
The 2009 Services LTIP is based entirely on non-market conditions and hence market assumptions are not required to determine the fair value of the award.
For 2011 it has been assumed that performance against the Services LTIP non-market conditions will be 0.3% Details of the basis of the LTIP schemes are set out in the remuneration report on page 48.

Matching shares may be awarded at a maximum ratio of one matching share for every one deferred share and are subject to a three year vesting period.
During the year matching shares were awarded at a ratio of 0.5 to 1.
Matching shares are subject to total shareholder return over three years measured relative to the companies ranked 51-150 by market capitalisation in the FTSE Index excluding investment trusts.
This replicates the LTIP performance condition for the July 2010 award.
The number of shares subject to an award will increase to reflect dividends paid through the performance period on the basis of such notional dividends being reinvested at the then prevailing share price.
Awards will normally vest as soon as the Remuneration Committee determines that the performance conditions have been met provided that the participant remains in employment at the end of the performance period.

No liability is expected to arise in respect of either bonds or guarantees.
b Disposal of subsidiaries The group has given certain guarantees and indemnities in relation to disposals of businesses.
On 5 March 2007 the group received notice of a claim for 23.4 million from Veolia Proprete S. A Veolia alleging breach of warranty in relation to the disposal of Biffa Belgium.
The group subsequently received notice from Veolia of a further claim for 5 million relating to the same matter.
The group considered that there was no basis for this claim and hence no provision was recorded in the financial statements in relation to this matter.
Following a hearing in the Commercial Court in Belgium in February 2010, the Court rendered judgment in favour of the group on 1 April 2010 and declared all of Veolias claims to be unfounded.
The group has received notice that Veolia has filed an appeal against this decision.
The group is not aware of any other liability that is likely to result from these guarantees and indemnities that has not been provided for in these financial statements.
c Regulatory matters Following an audit in September 2010 by the Drinking Water Inspectorate DWI of aspects of the services provided by Severn Trent Laboratories Ltd from its Bridgend laboratory, inorganic testing services provided by that laboratory were temporarily suspended, and transferred to another of the groups laboratories, pending completion of an investigation commissioned by Severn Trent Plc.
The results of this investigation have been discussed withthe DWI.
Inorganics testing resumed at Bridgend in January 2011 following accreditation by UKAS of revised testing processes.
At this stage it is not possible to determine what, if any, liability will arise as a result of this incident.
On 17 December 2010 Severn Trent Plc, Severn Trent Water Ltd and Severn Trent Laboratories Ltd received a request from Ofwatto provide certain information under the Competition Act in connection with Severn Trent Laboratories Ltds contracts with Severn Trent Water Ltd and certain other water companies.
The information requested has subsequently been provided to Ofwat.
At this stage it is not possible to determine what, if any, liability will arise as a result of this request.
36 Service concession arrangements The groups contract to provide water and waste water services to the Ministry of Defence MoD is a service concession arrangement under the definition set out in IFRIC 12.
The group acts as the service provider under the MoD Project Aquatrine Package C a 25 year contract spanning some 1,523 sites across England covering the Eastern sea border and from Lancashire in the North West to West Sussex on the South Coast.
Under the contract the group maintains and upgrades the MoD infrastructure assets and provides operating services for water and waste water.
The maintenance and upgrade services are charged at an agreed rate, adjusted for inflation, that is agreed in the contract.
The operating services are charged under an agreed volumetric tariff.
Since the group has an unconditional right to receive cash in exchange for the maintenance and upgrade services, the amounts receivable are recognised as a financial asset within prepayments and accrued income.
At 31 March 2011 the amount receivable was 27.1 million 2010: 26.2 million.
There have been no significant changes to the arrangement during the year.
