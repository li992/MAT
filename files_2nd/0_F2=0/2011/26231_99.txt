OUR GROUP OUR PERFORMANCE OUR APPROACH GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OTHER INFORMATION GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 141 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 28 SHARE CAPITAL, SHARE PREMIUM AND EMPLOYEE SCHEME TREASURY SHARES An equity instrument is any contract which evidences a residual interest in the net assets of an entity.
It follows that a financial instrument is treated as equity if: there is no contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or liabilities on unfavourable terms: and the instrument is either a non-derivative which contains no contractual obligation to deliver a variable number of own equity instruments, or is a derivative which will be settled only by the Group exchanging a xed amount of cash, or other financial assets, for a xed number of its own equity instruments.
Where any Group entity purchases the Companys equity share capital, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs net of income taxes, is deducted from equity attributable to shareholders.
Where such shares are subsequently sold, reissued or otherwise disposed of, any consideration received is included in equity attributable to shareholders, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects.
Shares held on behalf of employee share schemes are disclosed as such on the balance sheet.
