The Groups principal activity is the provision of engineering and construction services, principally in the oil services sector.
The Consolidated Financial Statements of Kentz Corporation Limited for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 10 April 2012.
Significant accounting policies a Statement of compliance The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and its interpretations adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
b Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are presented in US$, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional currency of the Group, as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are consolidated in accordance with the policies set out in note e iii below.
The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that financial instruments held for trading are recorded at their fair value.
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the Financial Statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 33.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these Consolidated Financial Statements and in preparing an opening IFRS Statement of Financial Position at 1 January 2004 for the purposes of the transition to IFRS.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by Group entities.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
See note 31. ii Acquisition accounting policy The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results of business combinations using the purchase method.
In the statement of financial position, the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are initially recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The results of acquired operations are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the date on which control is obtained.
They are deconsolidated from the date control ceases.
iii Joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control.
Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control such that significant operating and financial decisions require the consent of more than one venturer.
The Group has two types of joint ventures: Jointly controlled entities and Jointly controlled operations A jointly controlled entity is an entity over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The results, assets and liabilities of a jointly controlled entity are incorporated in these Consolidated Financial Statements using the equity method of accounting.

COM Financial statements notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Significant accounting policies continued A jointly controlled operation involves the use of assets and other resources of the Group and other venturers rather than the establishment of a corporation, partnership or other entity.
The Groups proportionate interest in the assets, liabilities, revenue, expenses and cash flows of jointly controlled operations are incorporated into the Groups Financial Statements under the appropriate headings.
iv Non-controlling interest Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries consolidated by the Group are disclosed separately from the Groups Equity in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and in the Consolidated Income Statement.
v Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-Group balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from the intra-Group transactions are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
d International Financial Reporting Standards not yet effective Set out below are new accounting standards and interpretations which will be applicable going forward.
None are expected to have a significant effect on the results of the operation.

e Foreign currency i Functional presentation currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the respective entity operates the functional currency.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in US Dollars, which is the Groups presentation currency.
ii Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated to US$ at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical costs in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to US$ at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
iii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to US$ at foreign exchange rates ruling at the Statement of Financial Position date.
The results and cash flows of foreign operations are translated to US$ at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on re-translation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity.
Significant accounting policies continued iv Net investment in foreign operations Adjustments arising on translation of the results of foreign operations at average rate, and on re-statement of the opening net assets at closing rates, are dealt with in a separate translation reserve within equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation, accumulated currency translation differences are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as part of the overall gain or loss on disposal: the cumulative currency translation differences arising prior to 1 January 2004 the translation date to IFRS have been set to zero for ascertaining the gain or loss on disposal of a foreign operation subsequent to that date.
Translation differences arising after 1 January 2004 are presented as a separate component of equity in the foreign currency translation reserve in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
f Property, plant and equipment i Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, as deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy m. Certain items of property, plant and equipment which had been revalued to fair value on or prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed costs, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
ii Leased assets Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
The Group has entered into various operating leases, the payments for which are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease terms see accounting policy t. iii Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment at the following rates: Buildings 10% Plant and fixtures 10%100% Motor vehicles 20%100% The residual value, if not insignificant, is re-assessed annually.
g Goodwill and intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition of a subsidiary or joint venture, over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is presented separately in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently when there is an indication that the goodwill may be impaired and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses, if any.
Impairment losses previously recognised cannot be reversed see accounting policy m. ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy m. Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an expense as incurred.
iii Amortisation Goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised.
However, they are systematically tested for impairment at each Statement of Financial Position date.
h Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses see accounting policy m. i Long-term contract work in progress Amounts recoverable on construction contracts, which are included in trade and other receivables, are stated at the net sales value of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account.
Cumulative costs incurred, net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, after deducting foreseeable losses and progress payments on account not matched with revenue, are included as construction contract balances within inventories.
Where the progress billings exceed the sum of costs incurred and recognised profit or recognised loss, the balance is shown under trade and other payables.

Significant accounting policies continued j Financial assets All financial assets are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs, except for those financial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs.
Where the effect on fair value at initial recognition of any extended payment terms is not material, no adjustments were made.
The fair value of a financial instrument on initial recognition is normally the transaction price, unless the fair value is evident from observable market data.
Subsequent measurement for financial assets is set out below.
Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables excluding Value Added Taxation, pre-payments and operating lease receivables, loans and cash and cash equivalents that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method less any impairment loss.
Interest income is recognised in profit or loss by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term trade receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Trade receivables are carried at original invoice amount less any impairment loss.
The accounting policy for bank and cash balances is dealt with under cash and cash equivalents set out below.
Trade receivables are carried at anticipated realisable value.
An estimate is made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts at the year end.
Bad debts are written off during the year in which they are identified.
fide-recognition of financial assets The Group fide-recognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity.
k Financial liabilities All financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value, including transaction costs, except for those financial liabilities classified as at fair value through profit or loss, which are initially measured at fair value, excluding transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement for financial liabilities is set out below.
Other financial liabilities not measured at fair value through profit or loss Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on an effective yield basis, except for short-term payables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected life of the financial liabilities or, where appropriate, a shorter period.
fide-recognition of financial liabilities The Group fide-recognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Groups obligations are discharged, cancelled or expired.
On fide-recognition, the difference between the carrying amount of the financial liability, including related unamortised costs, and settlement amount paid are included in profit or loss.
l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Statement of Cash Flows.
Bank overdrafts are included in interest bearing loans and borrowings in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Significant accounting policies continued m Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets see accounting policy u ii, are reviewed at each Statement of Financial Position date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, assets that have an indefinite useful life and intangible assets that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each Statement of Financial Position date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset of its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to cash-generating units group of units and then, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit group of units on a pro rata basis.
Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets were tested for impairment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, even though no indication of impairment existed.
When a decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset has been recognised directly in equity and there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired, the cumulative loss that had been recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss even though the financial asset has not been fide-recognised.
The amount of the cumulative loss that is recognised in profit or loss is the difference between the acquisition cost and current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit or loss.
n Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the Groups Financial Statements in the period in which they are declared by the Company.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
o Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The Groups net obligation in respect of the defined benefit pension plan is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the Statement of Financial Position date on high quality corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The excess of scheme liabilities over scheme assets is included in the Statement of Financial Position under non-current liabilities.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the scheme expected to arise from employee service current service cost in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period of the schemes liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included as other finance income costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to the transition to IFRS are recognised in full in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised and past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
A full actuarial valuation is carried out every three years.
The last actuarial valuation was performed on 1 May 2010. iii Share-based payments Where equity settled share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the vesting period.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments expected to vest at each reporting date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of options granted.
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.
76 KENTZ CORPORATION LTD ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 WWW.
Significant accounting policies continued The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition or where a non-vesting condition is not satisfied.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in the fair value of the options, measured immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the remaining vesting period.
p Provisions A provision is recognised in the Statement of Financial Position when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
q Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their settlement amount.
r Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at proceeds received, net of transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement is at amortised cost.
Finance charges including any premiums payable on settlement are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective rate of interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the Statement of Financial Position date.
s Revenue recognition Contract revenue is recognised under the percentage of completion method.
When the outcome of the contract can be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised by reference to the proportion that accumulated cost of sales up to the year end bear to the estimated total costs of the contract.
When the contract is at an early stage and its outcome cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised to the extent of costs incurred up to the year end which are considered recoverable.
Revenue related to variation orders is recognised when it is probable that the customer will approve the variation and the amount of revenue arising from the variation can be reliably measured.
A claim is recognised as contract revenue when settled or when negotiations have reached an advanced stage such that it is probable that the customer will accept the claim and the amount that it is probable will be accepted by the customer can be measured reliably.
Losses on contracts are assessed on an individual contract basis and provision is made for the full amount of the anticipated losses, including any losses relating to future work on a contract, in the period in which the loss is first foreseen.
t Expenses i Operating lease payments Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
ii Finance lease payments Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
iii Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings, calculated using the effective interest rate method, interest receivable on funds invested and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised in the Income Statement on the date the entitys right to receive payments is established which, in the case of quoted securities, is usually the ex-dividend date.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Significant accounting policies continued u Income tax Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, differences relating to investment in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Statement of Financial Position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
v Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are classified as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability or financial asset.
The Groups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
w Treasury shares Consideration paid for the purchase of treasury shares is recognised directly in equity.
The cost of treasury shares held is presented as a separate reserve the treasury share reserve.
Segmental reporting Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups geographical and business segments.
The primary format, geographical segments, is based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise mainly income-earning assets and revenue, interest-bearing loans, borrowings and expenses, and corporate assets and expenses.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the period to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one period.
i Geographical segments The Group manages its business on a worldwide basis by organising its activities into six distinct regions.
The geographical areas are: Middle East Far East Africa Australasia Americas Europe Europe includes all costs associated with the Groups administrative function.
In presenting the information on the basis of geographical segments, segment revenue and segment assets are based on the geographical location of assets.

Financial Instruments The principal objective of the Groups treasury policy is to ensure that there are sufficient resources to finance the business.
The cash resources of the Group are retained in a combination of central and local bank accounts.
These accounts comprise current, call and short-term deposits with banks approved by the Board.
Financial instruments held by the Group principally comprise financing facilities, cash and other items including receivables and payables, all of which arise directly from its operations.
The risks arising from these financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk.
The Board reviews, agrees and monitors policies for managing each of these risks: these are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged during the period under review.
a Liquidity risk Group cash resources held at banks are monitored regularly by senior management locally and at Group level.
It is the Groups policy to keep sufficient funds in current and call accounts to meet short-term needs.
Surplus funds are retained on short-term interest-bearing deposits.
At the Statement of Financial Position date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The Group also maintains overdraft facilities in certain entities.
b Interest rate risk The financial assets of the Group comprise trade and other receivables and cash and cash equivalents.
The trade and other receivables are non-interest-bearing.
The cash and cash equivalents earn interest at floating rates based on individual bank market rates for the relevant currencies and durations.
The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to bank loans and amounts payable under asset finance leases.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity analysis The impact on the Groups pre-tax profit due to a possible change in interest rates on loans and asset finance leases at the reporting date is demonstrated below: 2011 2010 US$000 US$000 1% movement 270 138 c Foreign currency risk The Financial Statements are prepared in US$, rounded to the nearest thousand which represents the functional currency of the Group as it is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales, purchases, borrowings and net investments in subsidiaries that are denominated in a currency other than the US$.
The principal currencies giving rise to this risk are Australian Dollar, South African Rand, United Arab Emirates Dirham, Saudi Riyal, Qatari Riyal, Kuwaiti Dinar, Euro, Russian Rouble, Canadian Dollar, Botswana Pula, Mozambique Metical and Madagascar Ariary.
Exchange rate risk is managed at the subsidiary levels by ensuring that, as far as possible, income and expenses are denominated in the appropriate functional currency.
Certain subsidiaries enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk of trading and intercompany balances in line with Board-approved policy.
Those contracts outstanding at the relevant period ends are not designated as cash flow, fair value or net investment hedges and are entered into for periods consistent with currency transaction exposures, which are short-term in nature with average duration of 14 months as at 31 December 2011.
The Group does not trade in any derivative financial instruments.
Exchange rate sensitivity analysis The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of profit before tax to selected movements in subsidiary foreign exchange rates with all other variables held constant.
The impact on profit before tax is based on a reasonably possible change in US dollar exchange rates with respect to different floating exchange rate reporting currencies.
The impact on total equity is calculated by changing the exchange rates used in measuring the closing balance sheet.
2011 2010 US$000 US$000 A 10% rate depreciation in these currencies versus US dollar Impact on profit before tax 832 1,842 Impact on total equity 2,132 2,671 d Fair values Forward exchange contracts open at the reporting period ends are marked to market to fair value the contracts.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had foreign exchange contracts outstanding with notional contract values of US$60.2 million and net unrealised gains of US$1.5 million.
The estimated fair values of the remaining financial instruments of the Group approximate to their book values as at the relevant period ends.
The following criteria have been used to assess the fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
Receivables, cash and cash equivalents and payables are based on their book values due to their short maturity period.
Loans are based on their book values which represents the Directors opinion of their fair values.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations approximates their carrying amounts.
As the Groups financing facilities bear interest at floating rates, which represent prevailing market rate, the Directors consider the carrying amount of these borrowings approximates their fair value.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the amounts due to from related companies approximates to the carrying value.

Employee benefits The following pension schemes operate in the Group.
a Irish administered defined benefit scheme The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for certain of its General and Professional Staff.
On 31 December 2010, this defined benefit pension scheme was closed for future service accrual.
Existing members have been invited to join a new company defined contribution scheme with effect from 1 January 2011.
The defined benefit pension plan is administered by independent trustees and is managed externally by independent investment managers.
The pension charge in the Consolidated Income Statement is calculated so as to spread the cost of pension provision over the employees expected working lives with the Group.
The pension cost is determined in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, using the Attained Age method.
An actuarial valuation was prepared for the General and Professional Staff Plan effective 1 May 2010.
The assumptions which most significantly affect the level of pension costs are those relating to the rate of return on the underlying investments of the plan and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions.
The financial assumptions inherent in the actuarial basis underlying the plan assumes that the long-term investment return exceeds the rate of increase in pensionable earnings by 2% per annum.
At the date of the most recent actuarial valuation, the market value of the assets held in General and Professional Plan amounted to 17,822,000 equivalent to US$23,922,000.
The actuarial value of the assets represented 56% of the liability for benefits under the valuation method, for service to the valuation date, based on the assumptions used in the actuarial review.
The actuarial report is not available for public inspection.

Acquisition during the year On 1 February 2011, Kentz Pty Limited acquired 100% of the share capital of RNE Engineering & Projects Pty Limited RNE in South Africa for a total cash consideration of South African Rand 73 million approximately US$10 million.
RNE undertakes project management, engineering and design services including process, mechanical, piping, civil and structural engineering for oil, gas and petrochemical process plants.
The acquisition will support the growth of activity in South Africa as well as the opportunity to jointly tender for select Engineering, Procurement and Construction EPC contracts.
Details of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows: In thousands of USD Fair value Property, plant and equipment 463 Intangible assets 1,687 Inventories 380 Receivables 934 Cash and cash equivalents 723 Payables 295 Deferred tax liability 552 3,340 Fair value of consideration paid: Cash paid 5,680 Deferred consideration at net present cost 4,875 Contingent consideration 3,203 Total consideration 7,352 Goodwill 4,012 The acquisitions costs have been charged to administrative expenses in the consolidated income statement for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The contingent consideration is payable should RNE meet performance targets for the financial years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2013.
A portion of the purchase consideration will be forfeited if the selling shareholders were to leave RNE before 31 December 2013.
The portion of the consideration relating to this is amortised over the three year period in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The liability for the remaining deferred consideration recognised at the acquisition date is measured at the fair value of the obligation at that date.
Differences on the remeasurement of this liability are recognised in profit or loss.
On an undiscounted basis, the total future payments for which the Group may be liable range from US$1.9 million to US$5.1 million.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill are the value of expected synergies arising from the acquisition.
The goodwill recognised will not be deductible for tax purposes.
From the date of acquisition, RNE has contributed US$8.7 million to revenues and US$2.2 million to PBT of the Group.
If the acquisition had taken place on 1 January 2011, revenues would have been US$1,368.5 million and PBT for the Group would have been US$79.7 million.

Critical accounting estimates and judgements Management makes estimates and judgements, including assumptions concerning the future.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows.
Revenue recognition The Group uses the  method in accounting for its contract revenue.
Use of the  method requires management to estimate the stage of completion of a contract to date as a proportion of the total contract work to be performed in accordance with the accounting policy set out in note 2 s. As a result, Kentz Group management is required to estimate the total cost to completion of all outstanding jobs at each period end.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions.
Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
Pension benefits The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions.
The assumptions used in determining the net cost income for pensions include the discount rate.
Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions.
Additional information is disclosed in note 25.
Events after the reporting period a Final dividend The Directors have proposed a final dividend of 7.3 US$ cents per share which would make a total dividend payment of 12.3 US$ cents per share for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The final dividend payment will be made in May 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 27 April 2012. b Kerbet Limited On 4 April 2012, Kerbet Limited disposed of 15 million shares in the Company representing 12.89% of the issued share capital by way of a secondary placing.
