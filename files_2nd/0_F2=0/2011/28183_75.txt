It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and deficits and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Due to the Companys tax status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval of such status in the foreseeable future, the Company and Group have not provided tax on any capital gains arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments held by the Company.
