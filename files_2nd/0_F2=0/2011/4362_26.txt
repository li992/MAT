The Groups policy on impairment of goodwill is set out in Note 2.
Further disclosures in accordance with paragraph 134 of IAS 36, Impairment of assets, are provided where the Group holds an individual goodwill item relating to a CGU that is significant, which the Group considers to be 15.0% of the total net book value, in comparison with the Groups total carrying value of goodwill.
The only significant item of goodwill included in the net book value above relates to BCA, a business within Metal Bulletin, which has a carrying value of 148.4 million 2010 146.7 million, 2009 144.6 million together with intangible assets with a carrying value of 71.8 million 2010 78.0 million, 2009 84.1 million.
The carrying value of BCA has been determined using a value in use calculation in line with IAS 36.
The methodology applied to the value in use calculations reflects past experience and external sources of information including: i Forecasts by the business based on cash flows derived from budgets for 2011.
The Directors believe these to be reasonably achievable.
ii Subsequent cash flows for one additional year increased in line with growth expectations of the business.
iii A discount rate of 8.5% and iv Long-term nominal growth rates of 3.0%.
Using the above methodology the recoverable amount exceeded the total carrying value by 84.0 million.
For this business the Directors performed a sensitivity analysis on the total carrying value of the CGU.
For the recoverable amount to be equal to the carrying value then the discount rate would need to be increased by 3.8% or the long-term growth rate would need to be reduced by 4.0%.
The carrying values of the Groups significant items of goodwill in relation to material business combinations, which the Group considers to be those which have a purchase consideration in excess of 100.0 million, are further analysed as follows: Metal Bulletin plc m Cost At 4th October, 2009 200.4 Exchange adjustment 2.2 At 3rd October, 2010 202.6 Exchange adjustment 1.7 At 2nd October, 2011 204.3 Metal Bulletin plc m Accumulated impairment losses At 4th October, 2009, 3rd October, 2010 and 2nd October, 2011 2.8 Net book value 2009 197.6 Net book value 2010 199.8 Net book value 2011 201.5 DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 119 AT A GLANCE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL POSITION continued SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 18 GOODWILL continued The impairment reversal charge is analysed by major CGU as follows: Intangible 2011 2010 Goodwill asset Discount Discount impairment impairment rate rate Reason for impairment CGU Segment m m % % charge Venue magazine Local media 1.0 9.5% 11.0% Reduced outlook Bristol News and Media titles Local media 7.2 9.5% 11.0% Reduced outlook East Surrey and Sussex News titles Local media 2.4 10.0% 11.5% Loss-making business Nottingham Post Group titles Local media 3.0 10.0% 11.5% Loss-making business Motors.

26 DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In December 2009, the Group sold a 50.0% interest in dmg radio Australia to Illyria Radio Investments Limited Illyria.
As required by IFRS 3 2008 this transaction was accounted for as a disposal of dmg radio Australia and the subsequent acquisition of a 50.0% interest in the jointly controlled business.
As part of this transaction Illyria invested A$37.5 million of equity which corresponded with the acquisition fair value of the Groups 50.0% stake.
In addition, both the Group and Illyria subscribed A$15.0 million each in redeemable preference shares at the time of the transaction.
As a result of the funding and borrowings established during the transaction, a balance of A$112.5 million owed to the Group was repaid.
Since the Group has joint control over the management of this business, the Groups remaining 50.0% interest has been accounted for as a joint venture.
The revenue of the Radio segment was 38.4 million from 17th December, 2009 to 3rd October, 2010.
There was no inter-segment revenue for this segment.

Further details of the Groups borrowing arrangements are set out in the Financial and Treasury Review on pages 38 to 43.
Loan notes The Group has issued loan notes which attract interest at rates of approximately LIBID to LIBID minus 1.0%.
The loan notes are repayable at the option of the loan note holders with a six month notice period and are treated as current liabilities.
32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT The Group is exposed to credit, interest rate and currency risks arising in the normal course of business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposures to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Capital risk management The Group manages its capital, defined as equity shareholders funds and net borrowings, to ensure that entities in the Group are able to continue as going concerns for the foreseeable future.
Debt management The Group borrows on an unsecured basis and arranges its debt to ensure an appropriate maturity profile.
The Groups principal sources of funding are the long-term sterling bond market and committed bank facilities.
The Group is mindful of its credit rating, currently BB and ensures it has sufficient committed bank facilities in order to meet short-term business requirements, after taking into account the Groups holding of cash and cash equivalents together with any distribution restrictions which exist.
The Group aims to maximise the term and flexibility of indebtedness and retain headroom in the form of undrawn committed bank facilities of approximately 100.0 million.
Additionally, the Group arranges its currency borrowings in order that they are in proportion to the ratio of earnings in that particular currency to total Group earnings.
The Directors consider that the Groups bond issuances together with its bank facilities will be sufficient to cover the likely mediumterm cash requirements of the Group.
Associates, joint ventures and other investments in general arrange and maintain their own financing and funding requirements.
In all cases such financing is non-recourse to the Company.

The actual ratio for the year was 1.99 times 2010 2.31 times, 2009 2.99 times.
On a bank covenant basis the ratio uses average exchange rate in the calculation of net debt.
The resultant Net Debt to EBITDA ratio is 1.96 times.
Cash and liquidity risk management The Group monitors cash balances and ensures that sufficient resources are available to meet entities operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to credit risk.
Market risk management The Groups primary market risks are interest rate fluctuations and exchange rate movements.
Interest rate risk management The limit imposed by the Groups bank covenants is at least three times EBITDA to net interest.
The actual ratio for the year was 6.36 times 2010 4.91 times, 2009 4.45 times.
The Groups interest rate exposure management policy is aimed at reducing the exposure of the consolidated businesses to changes in interest rates.
Group policy is to have 70% to 80% of interest exposures fixed with the balance floating.
This is achieved by issuing fixed rate sterling bond debt and entering into derivative contracts that economically swap fixed rate interest into floating rate.
Derivatives are used to hedge or reduce the risks of interest rate and exchange rate movements and are not entered into unless such risks exist.
The derivatives in place to meet Group policy are as follows: i Fixed to floating interest rate swaps hedging a portion of the Groups bonds: Changes in the fair value of the swaps are recognised in the income statement and at the same time the carrying value of the hedged bonds is adjusted for movements in the hedged risk to the extent effective and those adjustments are also recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
These interest rate swaps amount to 75.0 million 2010 75.0 million, 2009 75.0 million with the Group paying floating rates of between 1.24% and 1.61% 2010 1.24% and 3.60%, 2009 1.99% and 6.03%.
ii Cross currency fixed to fixed interest rate swaps.
These amounted to 192.3 million US$355.0 million 2010 227.6 million US$435.0 million 2009 227.6 million US$ 435.0 million resulting in the Group paying fixed US dollar interest at rates of between 4.40% and 6.07% 2010 4.40% and 6.07%, 2009 4.40% and 6.07%, 8.5 million AUS$20.0 million 2010 8.5 million AUS$20.0 million, 2009 18.8 million AUS$45.0 million with the Group paying fixed Australian dollar interest at 6.22% 2010 6.15% and 6.22%, 2009 6.15% and 6.22%.
iii The Group also had a number of outstanding interest rate caps.
The fair values of interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and forward foreign exchange contracts represent the replacement costs calculated using market rates of interest and exchange at 2nd October, 2011.
The fair value of long-term borrowings has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at market rates.
Foreign exchange rate risk management Translation exposures arise on the earnings and net assets of business operations in entities with functional currencies other than that of the parent company.
The net asset exposures are economically hedged, to a significant extent, by a policy of denominating borrowings in currencies where significant translation exposures exist, most notably US dollars.
The Group also designates currency swaps and forward contracts as net investment hedges, hedging the Groups overseas investments.
Credit risk management The Groups principal credit risk relates to its trade and other receivables and non-performance by counterparties to financial instrument contracts.
Trade and other receivables The Groups customer base is diversified geographically and by division with customers generally of a good financial standing.
Before accepting any new customers, the Group assesses the potential customers credit quality and sets credit limits by customer.
The average credit period is 42 days 2010 44 days, 2009 48 days.
The Group considers the credit risk of trade receivables to be low, although the Group remains vigilant in the current economic climate.
The Group reserves the right to charge interest on overdue receivables, although the Group does not hold collateral over any trade receivable balances.
The Group makes an allowance for bad and doubtful debts specific to individual debts.
This provision is reviewed regularly in conjunction with a detailed analysis of historic payment profiles and past default experience.
The Groups receivables are stated net of allowances for doubtful debts and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Institutional counterparty risk The Group seeks to limit interest rate and foreign exchange risks, described above, by the use of financial instruments.
As a result, credit risk arises from the potential non-performance by the counterparties to those financial instruments, which are unsecured.
The amount of this credit risk is normally restricted to the amounts of any hedge gain and not the principal amount being hedged.
The Group also has a credit exposure to counterparties for the full principal amount of cash and cash equivalents.
Group policy is to have no more than 20.0 million deposited or at risk with any AA counterparty, 10.0 million for A rated counterparties.

The Group has no significant concentration of risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is considered low since the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings.
At the period end date the Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows: At At At 2nd October, 3rd October, 4th October, 2011 2010 2009 m m m Expiring in one year or less Trade and other receivables 243.6 262.1 296.1 Bank deposits 174.3 65.7 47.4 Derivative financial instruments 1.1 2.3 17.9 Expiring in more than one year Trade and other receivables 26.0 13.8 11.6 Derivative financial instruments 8.6 8.7 5.5 453.6 352.6 378.5 Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value at the date the derivatives are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value is determined by using market data and the use of established estimation techniques such as discounted cash flow and option valuation models.
The Group designates certain derivatives as: i Hedges of the change of fair value of recognised assets and liabilities fair value hedges : or ii Hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges : or iii Hedges of net investment in foreign operations net investment hedges To qualify for hedge accounting, each individual hedging relationship must be expected to be effective, be designated and documented at its inception and throughout the life of the hedge relationship.
Fair value hedges The Groups policy is to use interest rate swaps to convert a proportion of its fixed rate debt to floating rates in order to hedge the interest rate risk with changes in fair value of the hedging instrument recognised in the income statement for the period together with the changes in the fair value of the hedged item due to the hedged risk, to the extent the hedge is effective.
When the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Gains and losses on the borrowings and related derivatives designated as fair value hedges included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 2nd October, 2011 were: At Fair value At Fair value At 4th September, movement 3rd October, movement 2nd October, 2009 gain loss 2010 gain loss 2011 m m m m m Sterling interest rate swaps 4.4 3.8 8.2 0.1 8.3 Sterling debt 4.4 3.8 8.2 0.1 8.3 Total Cash flow hedges The Groups policy is to use certain derivative financial instruments in order to hedge the foreign exchange risk arising from certain firm commitments or forecast highly probable transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the relevant Group entity.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement.
If a hedged firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time that the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains and losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the Consolidated Income Statement.

At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
All cash flow hedges were effective throughout the year ended 2nd October, 2011.
All amounts deferred in equity at the year end are expected to impact the Consolidated Income Statement in the next 18 months when the related cash flows are expected to occur.
Net investment hedges The Group seeks to manage the foreign currency exposure arising on retranslation of the reporting entitys share of net assets of foreign operations at each reporting date by designating certain derivative financial instruments and foreign currency borrowings as net investment hedging instruments.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments are recognised in equity to the extent that the hedging relationship is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is recognised immediately in the Consolidated Income Statement for the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Gains and losses accumulated in the translation reserve are included in the Consolidated Income Statement on disposal of the foreign operation.
All net investment hedges were effective throughout the year ended 2nd October, 2011.
Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting represent forward contracts which provide a gain or loss equivalent to income tax payable or receivable on foreign exchange gains or losses incurred when intra Group balances are translated to the closing rate at the year end.
These contracts Tax Equalisation Swaps are marked to market with the movement in fair value taken to income.
Tax Equalisation Swaps are not capable of being designated as hedging instruments under IAS 39.

However, changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates may have an impact on the Groups results.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in interest rates would have increased the Groups finance costs by 1.1 million 2010 1.0 million, 2009 3.7 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Groups variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate swaps, at the year end date.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in interest rates would have decreased the Groups finance costs by 1.3 million 2010 1.0 million, 2009 4.0 million.
This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the Groups variable rate borrowings, net of any interest rate swaps, as at the year end date.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that a 10.0% strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have reduced the net loss taken to equity by 55.6 million 2010 51.1 million, 2009 51.4 million and increased the net loss taken to income by nil 2010 nil, 2009 nil.
A 10.0% weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net loss taken to equity by 64.0 million 2010 62.4 million, 2009 63.8 million and decreased the net loss taken to income by nil 2010 nil, 2009 nil.
This sensitivity has been calculated by applying the foreign exchange change to the Groups financial instruments which are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that an increase of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would lead to a decrease in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of 0.2 million 2010 nil, 2009 nil.
At 2nd October, 2011, it is estimated that a decrease of 1.0% in the rate used to discount the expected gross value of payments would lead to an increase in the fair value of acquisition put option commitments of 0.2 million 2010 nil, 2009 nil.

based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted process unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data

33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of pension schemes covering most major Group companies under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The schemes include funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits in addition to a number of defined contribution pension arrangements.
The defined benefit schemes in the UK and some defined contribution plans are administered by trustees or trustee companies and are closed to new employees.
The Group has been progressively introducing a number of PensionSaver group personal pension plans to provide a consistent pensions saving vehicle across all Group divisions.
These plans have replaced the trust-based defined contribution arrangements which are now in the final stages of being wound up.
The assets of all the pension schemes and plans are held independently from the Groups finances.
The total net pension costs of the Group for the year ended 2nd October, 2011 were 16.5 million 2010 27.7 million.
On 16th June, 2011 an amendment to the International Accounting Standard 19 Employee Benefits IAS19 was issued which will be effective from 1st January, 2013.
The principal effect on these financial statements if the amended IAS19 had been applied to the year ended 2nd October, 2011 would have been an increase to Finance Costs as reported in the Consolidated Income Statement of 25.1 million 2010 22.5 million with a corresponding decrease in the actuarial loss reported within Cumulative actuarial loss gain in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income SOCI.
Defined Benefit Schemes With effect from 1st April, 2011 the benefit design of the Harmsworth Pension Scheme changed significantly to align with the Companys objective of controlling risk and cost going forward.
On the same date the Scheme also ceased to be contracted-out of the State Second Pension.
The Scheme continues to operate on a defined benefit basis but total benefits are no longer linked to final salary.
These changes do not affect benefit entitlements accrued by members prior to 1st April, 2011.
Benefits accrued up to 31st March, 2011 are protected on a final salary basis, but they have been fide-linked from pensionable salary.
This part of a members benefit will instead be increased in line with the retail price index RPI, capped at 5%.
From 1st April, 2011 benefits are accrued on a cash basis rather than a pension basis with members building up a retirement account a cash balance which is used to buy an annuity from an insurance company at retirement.
The accumulated retirement account is calculated on a Career Average Revalued Earnings CARE basis using pensionable pay history.
The Company communicated these changes through a formal employee consultation process that ended in February 2011.

These statutory increases previously related to RPI will in future be increased in line with the consumer prices index CPI.
The Scheme was closed to new employees with effect from 1st October, 2009 and will fully close to new entrants on 31st March, 2012.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out triennially by the actuary.
The latest valuation as at 31st March, 2010, was signed on 30th June, 2011 along with a new schedule of contributions.
In view of the closure of the Scheme to new entrants, it was agreed to use a control period, over which the future contribution rate is assessed, equal to the average working lifetime of the active membership, known as the attained age method.
The valuation as at 31 March, 2010 and the funding basis arising from it makes allowance for the scheme changes described above.
The rates of normal cash contributions paid by the Company to the principal scheme under the two schedules of contributions in force during the year were 18.0% of members scheme salaries 2010 18.0 % for the six-month period to 31st March, 2011 with employees contributing either 5.0% or 7.5% depending on which section of the scheme they are in, followed by six months from 1st April, 2011 of the equivalent of 10.0% of members basic salary for the Standard section with members contributing 4% and 15.0% of members basic salary for the Plus section with members contributing 6.0%.
As a part of funding agreements with the trustees of the main schemes the Company has agreed Recovery Plans involving a series of annual funding payments amounting to 265.9 million over a period to end on 5th October, 2023.
The first of these payments amounting to 36.7 million was made post year end on 5th October, 2011.
The normal and deficit funding payments described above are subject to review following subsequent actuarial valuations.
The funding strategy agreed with the trustee of the principal schemes in connection with the 2007 valuation made allowance for assumed future investment returns on the Schemes assets of 3.3% p. a. above price inflation, compared with the real return of some 2.6% p. a. implicit within the calculation of the Technical Provisions i. e. the value of the Schemes benefit liabilities.
The Company agreed with the Trustees that this margin would be covered by a contingent asset and the Company put in place letters of credit of an amount sufficient to cover any potential shortfall in this additional investment return arising prior to the 2010 triennial valuation.
As at 2nd October, 2011, the letters of credit which are due to expire on 31 March, 2012 had a value of 53.6 million 2010 54.5 million.
At 2nd October, 2011, the defined benefit obligation to the Group relating to the DMGT AVC Plan the Plan, as measured for the purposes of this disclosure under the requirements of IAS19, was 60.0 million 2010 61.8 million.
The assets of the Plan were 47.3 million 2010 52.1 million, producing a deficit of 12.7 million 2010 9.7 million deficit.
The Plan is closed to further member contributions.
The last triennial valuation of the Plan showed that the combined accumulated assets as at 31st March, 2008 represented 100.0% of the Plans Technical Provisions in respect of past service benefits.
As at 31st March, 2010 the funding position of the Plan measured on a Technical Provisions basis stood at 92.0%.
Recent quarterly updates provided to the Trustees indicate that the funding position has since deteriorated in common with most other defined benefit plans.
The Group has not been required to make contribution payments in respect of the Plan.
The next actuarial valuation of the Plan is due to take place as at 31st March, 2011 with the results not expected until 2012.
Members of the defined benefit schemes are able to make additional voluntary contributions AVCs into unit-linked funds held within each scheme.
No benefit obligation arises to the Group from these AVCs and the related unit-linked AVC assets have been excluded from the scheme assets reported below.
The figures in this note are based on calculations using membership data as at 30th September, 2011 along with asset valuations and cash flow information from the schemes for the year to 2nd October, 2011.

Having taken account of the rules of the Schemes, the fact that the Schemes remain open to new accrual, and the current and anticipated levels of service cost and cash contributions, the Company considers that recognition of surpluses in the Schemes on its Statement of Financial Position is in accordance with the interpretations of IFRIC 14.
In 2011, 2010 and 2009 all Schemes were in deficit.

The expected return on bonds has been selected having regard to gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
The expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of estimated risk premiums over Government bond yields, the gross redemption yields on bonds, and consensus economic forecasts for future returns.
The actual return on Plan assets was 29.7 million 2010 return of 188.6 million, 2009 loss of 51.7 million representing the expected return plus the associated actuarial gain or loss during the year.
The main financial assumptions are shown as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks 53 weeks ending ending ending 2nd October, 3rd October, 4th October, 2011 2010 2009 % % % Price inflation 3.00 3.10 3.10 Salary increases 2.90 2.90 3.00 Pension increases 2.90 2.90 3.00 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.20 5.00 5.40 Expected overall rate of return on assets 6.70 6.60 7.00 The discount rate for Scheme liabilities reflects yields at the period end date on high quality corporate bonds.
The assumption for salary growth has been adjusted to take account of the limit on the extent to which expected future pay increases will count towards pension accrued and being earned in the Schemes.
All assumptions were selected after taking actuarial advice.
Mortality assumptions take account of Scheme experience, and also allow for further improvements in life expectancy based on medium cohort projections but with a minimum rate of reduction in mortality rates in future of 1.0% per annum.
Allowance is made for the extent to which employees have chosen to commute part of their pension for cash at retirement and for the proportion of members with dependants at retirement eligible for a pension.
The table below illustrates examples of the assumed average life expectancies from age 60 for the principal Schemes: 52 weeks 52 weeks 53 weeks ending ending ending 2nd October, 3rd October, 4th October, 2011 2010 2009 Future life Future life Future life expectancy expectancy expectancy from age 60 from age 60 from age 60 years years years For a current 60-year old male member of the scheme 27.0 25.8 25.6 For a current 60-year old female member of the scheme 28.8 27.7 28.2 For a current 50-year old male member of the scheme 28.6 26.9 26.7 For a current 50-year old female member of the scheme 30.3 28.3 29.2 The amounts charged to the Consolidated Income Statement based on the above assumptions are shown as follows: 52 weeks 52 weeks ending ending 2nd October, 3rd October, 2011 2010 m m Service cost 17.2 23.8 Service cost in respect of salary sacrifice 5.5 6.4 Settlement curtailment 9.5 Charge to operating profit 22.7 20.7 Interest cost 91.8 101.4 Expected return on assets 104.1 99.2 Credit charge to net Finance costs 12.3 2.2 Total net charge to the Consolidated Income Statement 10.4 22.9 148 DAILY MAIL AND GENERAL TRUST PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2011 AT A GLANCE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL POSITION continued SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 33 RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued Pension costs and the size of any pension surplus or deficit are sensitive to the assumptions adopted.

The deferred tax assets disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position in respect of tax losses and tax credits are analysed as follows: At At At 2nd October, 3rd October, 4th October, 2011 2010 2009 m m m UK 19.4 31.1 18.3 North America 62.4 55.1 59.1 Australia 6.8 3.7 1.9 88.6 89.9 79.3 These losses have been recognised on the basis that the Directors are of the opinion based on recent and forecast trading, that sufficient suitable taxable profits will be generated in the relevant territories in future accounting periods, such that it is considered probable that these assets will be recovered.
Of these assets, 45.0 million will expire between 2018 and 2027.
The remaining assets have no expiry date.
Included in the credit to income of 25.2 million 2010 31.2 million, 2009 68.7 million is nil 2010 0.5 million, 2009 15.4 million relating to discontinued operations.
Included in Other deferred tax are deferred tax assets of 5.3 million 2010 3.6 million, 2009 4.9 million in respect of financial instruments and 3.2 million 2010 3.4 million, 2009 4.9 million in respect of capital losses and deferred tax liabilities of 3.2 million 2010 6.6 million, 2009 5.6 million in respect of revaluations and rolled over gains.
The 1.7 million credit to equity 2010 nil, 2009 nil relates entirely to financial instruments.
There is an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 72.9 million 2010 89.2 million, 2009 68.0 million which relates to revenue losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Of these assets 19.6 million will expire between 2018 and 2030.
There is an additional unprovided deferred tax asset relating to capital losses carried forward of 63.1 million 2010 42.2 million, 2009 23.6 million.
No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of 79.8 million 2010 68.2 million, 2009 52.9 million relating to the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The temporary differences at 2nd October, 2011 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of a dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas tax jurisdictions in which these subsidiaries operate.
The UK Government has announced a future decrease in the UK corporation tax rate from 26.0% to 23.0% over the next three years.
The impact of these proposed rate changes would be to reduce the UK deferred tax assets included within non-current assets from 128.6 million to 118.3 million if they were all to reverse at 23.0%.

The options become exercisable after a four year vesting period and lapse after five years and five years from grant date under the 2001 and 2005 option plan respectively.
Previously, the stock issued under the plan was subject to a nine month holding period, which has been subsequently removed during 2007.
The stock issued under the plan is subject to put or call options where DMGT has the right to settle in DMGT A Ordinary shares or cash.
The options plan classification changed from a cash settled plan in June 2005 to an equity settled plan following this change of settlement feature of stock issued under the plan.

Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2010 CAP 2010 The CAP 2010 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 21st January, 2010.
Each CAP 2010 award comprises two equal elements an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25p each in the Company at an exercise price of 0.25p per Ordinary Share, and a right to receive a cash payment.
The awards will vest in two equal tranches.
The first tranche of awards will become exercisable on satisfaction of the primary performance condition, but no earlier than February 2013 and lapse to the extent unexercised by 30th September, 2020.
The second tranche of awards becomes exercisable in the February following a subsequent financial year in which adjusted pre-tax profits of the Euromoney Group again equal or exceed 100.0 million increased to 105.0 million following the acquisition of NDR, but no earlier than February, 2014.
The second tranche only vests on satisfaction of the primary performance condition and an additional performance condition.
The number of options received under the share award of the CAP 2010 is reduced by the number of options vesting with participants from the 2010 Company Share Option Plan see opposite.
The primary performance condition was achieved in the 2011 financial year, two years earlier than expected, when adjusted pre-tax profits were 101.3 million.
However, the internal rules of the plan prevent the awards vesting more than one year early so although the primary condition has been achieved the award pool will be allocated between the holders of outstanding awards by reference to their contribution to the growth in profits of the Group from the 2009 base year to the profits achieved in the 2012 financial year and these awards are expected to become exercisable in February, 2013.
The CAP 2010 options were valued using a fair value model that adjusted the share price at the date of grant for the net present value of expected future dividend streams up to the date of expected exercise.
The expected term of the option used in the models has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

The CSOP 2010 UK was approved by HM Revenue and Customs on 21st June, 2010 and granted on 28th June, 2010.
The CSOP 2010 UK option enables each participant to purchase up to 4,972 shares in the Company at a price of 6.03 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
The options will vest and become exercisable at the same time as the corresponding share award under the CAP 2010 providing the CSOP option is in the money at that time and does not vest before 28th June, 2013.
The CSOP 2010 Canada, granted on 30th March, 2010, enables each participant to purchase up to 19,960 shares in the Company at a price of 5.01 per share, the market value at the date of grant.
No option may vest after the date falling three months after the preliminary announcement of the results for the financial year ended 30th September, 2019 and the option shall lapse to the extent unvested at the time.
The CSOP has the same performance criteria as that of the CAP 2010 as set out above.
The number of CSOP 2010 awards that vest proportionally reduce the number of shares that vest under the CAP 2010, the CSOP is effectively a delivery mechanism for part of the CAP 2010 award.
The CSOP 2010 option exercise price of 6.03 UK and 5.01 Canada will be satisfied by a funding award mechanism and results in the same net gain on the CSOP options calculated as the market price of the Companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price multiplied by the number of options exercised delivered in the equivalent number of shares to participants as if the award had been delivered using 0.0025 CAP options.

The amount of the funding award will depend on the Companys share price at the date of exercise.
Because of the above and the other direct links between the CSOP 2010 and the CAP 2010, including the identical performance criteria, IFRS 2 Share-based Payments combines the two plans and treats them as one plan vesting in two tranches.
As such the long-term incentive expense recognised in the year for the CSOP 2010 and CAP 2010 options including the charge in relation to the cash element was 15.9 million 2010 3.9 million.
Exercise price of Canadian CSOP is 5.01.
Net gain on the CSOP options is the market price of the Companys shares at the date of exercise less the exercise price 6.031 multiplied by the number of options exercised.
Exercise price excludes the effect of the funding award.
Cash-settled options Euromoney has liabilities in respect of three share option schemes that are classified by IFRS 2 Share-based Payments as cash settled.
These consists of the cash element of the CAP 2010 scheme, options held by employees over new equity shares in Internet Securities Inc. a subsidiary of the Group, and, from 2011, options held by employees over equity shares in Structured Retail Products Limited previously Arete Consulting Limited, a subsidiary of the Group.
The total carrying value at 30th September, 2011 included in the Statement of Financial Position is a liability of 10.3 million 2010: 2.1 million.
Of these schemes, options with an intrinsic value of 7,000 2010: 36,000 had vested but are not yet exercised.
The Euromoney Capital Appreciation Plan 2004 CAP 2004 The CAP 2004 executive share option scheme was approved by shareholders on 1st February, 2005.
Each of the CAP awards comprises an option to subscribe for Ordinary Shares of 0.25p each in the Company for an exercise price of 0.25p per Ordinary Share.
The awards become exercisable on satisfaction of certain performance conditions and lapse to the extent unexercised on 30th September, 2014.
The initial performance condition was achieved in the financial year 2007 and the option pool a maximum of 7.5 million shares was allocated between the holders of outstanding awards.
