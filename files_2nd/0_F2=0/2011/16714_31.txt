In July 2011, a reduction in the UK tax rate from 26% to 25%, effective from 1 April 2012, was substantively enacted.
In accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes, the deferred tax liabilities and assets have been calculated using a rate of 25%.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax liabilities assets accordingly.
