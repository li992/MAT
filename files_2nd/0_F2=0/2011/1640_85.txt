The government has also proposed reducing the UK corporation tax rate by a further 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
However, these further rate changes had not been substantively enacted at the Balance sheet date and their effects are not, therefore, included in these financial statements.
We do not expect that the enactment of these changes will have a material impact on the deferred tax balance of the Group.
