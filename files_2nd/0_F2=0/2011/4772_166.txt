During the period, a deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of previously unrecognised losses within the Group.
These amounted to 3.4 million net, of which 2.7 million has been utilised in the period.
These were not recognised previously as due to the nature of these losses, the Directors did not consider that taxable profits would arise in the relevant company from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
The Directors now consider that sufficient taxable profits will arise in the relevant company from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
There are no further unrecognised deferred tax losses within the Group.
Elements of these deferred tax balances may be payable recoverable within one year.
However, the Directors consider that it is not possible to quantify the amount because the level of uncertainty in the timing of events and have therefore classified the whole balance as due after more than one year.
