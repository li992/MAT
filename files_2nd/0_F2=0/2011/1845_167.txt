The Groups operations and financing arrangements expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, credit risks, liquidity risks and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and, accordingly, there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate mitigating actions taken by the central treasury department.
These forecasts are further stress tested at a Group level on a regular basis to ensure that adequate headroom within facilities and banking covenants is maintained.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance, in particular by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to hedge interest rates and currency rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board approves treasury policies and certain day-to-day treasury activities have been delegated to a centralised Treasury Operating Committee, which in turn regularly reports to the Board.
The treasury department implements guidelines that are established by the Board and the Treasury Operating Committee.
a Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will be unable to meet its liabilities as they fall due.

The Groups borrowings are typically cyclical throughout the financial year and peak in April and May and October and November of each year, due to seasonal trends in income.
Accordingly the Group maintains sufficient facility headroom to cover these requirements.
On a normal operating basis the Group has a policy of maintaining headroom of up to 150.0m.
The Group identifies and takes appropriate actions based upon its regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from its operations.
