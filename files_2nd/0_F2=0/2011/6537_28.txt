Genus plc Annual Report 2011 108 Financial Statements Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2011 37.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the current and prior year.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
The Companys financial statements are included in the Genus plc consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2011.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a cash flow statement under the terms of FRS 1 revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements.
The Company is also exempt under the terms of FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures from disclosing transactions with other members of the Genus Group.
Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition or at their latest valuation, less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the assets to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis.
The rates of annual depreciation on tangible fixed assets are as follows: Leasehold land and buildings period of lease Equipment 320 years Motor vehicles 35 years The carrying value of fixed assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments Fixed assets investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Pensions A number of employees are members of defined contribution pension schemes.
Contributions are charged to profit and loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from those of the Company.
Certain current and former employees of the Company are members of one of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes, further details of which are given in note 28 of the Group Financial Statements.
The schemes are all multi-employer defined benefit schemes, the assets and liabilities of which are held independently from the Group.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme and accordingly accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and the laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred taxation assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements and which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of the future remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Company Business Corporate Financial Overview Review Governance Statements Genus plc Annual Report 2011 109 Deferred taxation is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or if appropriate at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Treasury shares The Company has adopted UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, which requires the assets and liabilities associated with the Companys investment in its own shares to be recognised in the Companys financial statements where there is fide facto control of the assets and liabilities.
The Companys own shares held by a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST remain deducted from shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally with employees.
Employee share schemes Executive Directors and Chief Operating Officers of the Company receive part of their remuneration in the form of share awards which vest upon meeting performance criteria over a three year period.
The cost of such awards is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares at the date of the award.
At the end of each financial reporting period an estimate is made of the extent to which those performance criteria will be met at the end of three years and an appropriate charge recorded in the profit and loss account together with a corresponding credit to profit and loss reserves.
Changes in estimates of the number of shares vesting may result in charges or credits to the profit and loss account in subsequent periods.
Share-based payments The Company has implemented the generally accepted accounting principle for accounting for share-based payments with its subsidiary undertaking under UITF 44, whereby the Company has granted the rights of its shares to the employees of its subsidiary undertaking under an equity-settled arrangement and the subsidiaries have not reimbursed to the Company for these rights.
Under this arrangement, the Company treats the share-based payment recognised in the subsidiarys accounts as a cost of investment in the subsidiary and credits equity with an amount equal to the share-based payment recognised by these subsidiaries in their accounts.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging The Companys activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
The Company uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate risk.
The Company also uses forward foreign currency contracts implemented through a medium-term US Dollar cross currency borrowing and related interest rate swap to hedge exposure to translation risk associated with US Dollar net assets of subsidiary entities.
Forward foreign currency contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting in the Parent Company Financial Statements, as the hedged item is not in its balance sheet.
The use of financial derivative instruments is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use on financial derivatives.
Information about the Groups financial risks, the management thereof, and the use of financial instruments and their impact on the Groups risk, profile, performance, and financial condition is included in the notes to the Group Financial Statements.
The fair value of the US Dollar and interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the quoted forward price.
Genus plc Annual Report 2011 110 Financial Statements Notes to the Parent Company Financial Statements continued For the year ended 30 June 2011 37.
Significant accounting policies continued Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Where a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects profit or loss, i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the profit and loss account immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the hedge relationship, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity until such point as the investment to which it relates is disposed.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying value of the debt to which they relate.

The aggregate of the fair values of those options granted was 723,000.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted is based on the fair value of share options granted, measured using a binomial model, with the following inputs: 2011 2010 Assumptions applied in valuation models at grant date Exercise price of options granted in the year nil for awards 729p 655p Expected volatility weighted average volatility 30% 30% Option life expected weighted average life 6.5 years 6.5 years Expected dividends 1.80% 1.80% Risk-free interest rate based on government bonds 2.5% 2.97% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the estimated fair value of the Companys share price over the previous three years.
The option life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Share awards In addition to the outstanding share options above, there are a total of 746,122 conditional share awards which are outstanding at 30 June 2011.
These conditional shares were awarded to Executive Directors and senior management on 19 September 2008, 15 October 2008, 3 March 2009, 15 September 2009, 2 March 2010, 10 September 2010 and 22 September 2010 under the 2004 Performance Share Plan.
