efficiency to cut costs for us and our occupiers, at the same time as reducing carbon emissions.
NEXT YEAR, WE WILL: Roll out our energy optimisation process at more buildings, and pilot it at two shopping centres: In nine of our multi-let office buildings, we recently installed a new energy metering system and implemented a remote monitoring Work closely with building management teams to achieve process to optimise efficiency, following a successful pilot at our projected energy reductions where we have implemented Head Office see below.
This will reduce base-build energy use our optimisation process: common parts and shared services by at least 10% in each Undertake selective base-build energy and water reviews building.
We expect to recoup capital costs within three years which will highlight opportunities for capital investment through energy savings.
to drive further reductions in each building: We also continue to work with our office occupiers to drive energy Where office occupiers are committed to energy reductions in the areas they control, sharing information and reductions, offer to fund energy reviews in their areas.
We provide our office occupiers with sixmonthly building environmental statements, containing detailed, year-on-year building management and occupier performance For our 2011 12 targets visit comparisons.

This year, we reduced British Land influenced energy use at York House by 38% compared to 2008 09 and occupiers reduced energy use in their areas by 11%.
The total savings over the last two years were 2.4 million kWh, cutting emissions by over 1,000 tonnes and saving 141,000.
This is largely thanks to effective day-to-day management and a new energy metering system and optimisation process which we are now rolling out, with occupier agreement, across our office portfolio.
