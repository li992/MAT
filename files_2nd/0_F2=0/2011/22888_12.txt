DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2011 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
General information Dexion Absolute Limited the Company was incorporated with limited liability in Guernsey, Channel Islands as a closed-ended investment company on 26 November 2002.
The Companys ordinary Shares were initially listed on the London Stock Exchange on 19 December 2002.
The Company is authorised as a closed-ended investment company under The Authorised Closed Ended Investment Schemes Rules 2008.
Significant accounting policies a Statement of Compliance The financial statements which give a true and fair view are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and are in compliance with the Companies Guernsey Law, 2008.
Determination and presentation of operating segments IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires a management approach, under which segment information is presented on the same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
The board is of the view that the Company is engaged in the conduct of two business segments, being the management of the Continuing Portfolio for those Shareholders who wished to continue their investment in the Company and the management of the Redemption Portfolio in order to realise the investments attributable to Redeeming Shareholders.
The key measure of performance used by the Board to assess the Companys performance and to allocate resources is the total return on the Companys net asset value on the Continuing Portfolio, as calculated under IFRS.
The key measures of performance used by the Board to assess the performance of the Redemption Portfolio is the timing and extent of realisations to Redeeming Shareholders.
As the valuations of investments of both Portfolios are computed independently and items of income and expense are allocated to each Portfolio in accordance with the discretion of the Directors, no reconciliation is required between the measure of profit or loss used by the Board and that contained in these financial statements.
The Board of Directors has overall management and control of the Company.
Material changes to the investment objective or investment policy can only be made with Shareholder approval.
The Board of Directors has delegated the day to day implementation of this strategy to its Investment Adviser but retain responsibility to ensure that adequate resources of the Company are directed in accordance with their decisions.
The investment decisions of the Investment Adviser are reviewed on a regular basis to ensure compliance with the policies and legal responsibilities of the Board.
The Investment Adviser has been given full authority to act on behalf of the Company, including the authority to purchase and sell securities and other investments on behalf of the Company and to carry out other actions as appropriate to give effect thereto.
Whilst the Investment Adviser may make the investment decisions on a day to day basis regarding the allocation of funds to different investments, any changes to the investment strategy or major allocation decisions have to be approved by the Board, and any material changes to the investment strategy have to be approved by Shareholders, even though they may be proposed by the Investment Adviser and Manager.
The Board therefore retains full responsibility as to the major allocations decisions made on an ongoing basis.
The Investment Adviser will always act in accordance with the investment policy and investment restrictions set out in the Company's latest Prospectus which cannot be radically changed without the approval of the Shareholders.
Applicable new standards and interpretations not yet adopted A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2011, and have not been adopted in preparing these financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the measurement of the amounts recognised in the financial statements of the Company.
IFRS 9, Financial Instruments is not expected to have an impact on the measurement basis of the financial assets since the majority of the Companys financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
32 DEXION ABSOLUTE LIMITED 2011 REPOR T & ACCOUNTS 2.
Significant accounting policies continued a Applicable new standards and interpretations not yet adopted continued IFRS 9 deals with recognition, derecognition, classification and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities.
Its requirements represent a significant change from the existing requirements in IAS 39 in respect of financial assets.
The standard contains two primary measurement categories for financial assets: at amortised cost and fair value.
A financial asset would be measured at amortised cost if it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets in order to collect contractual cash flows, and the assets contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstanding.
All other financial assets would be measured at fair value.
The standard eliminates the existing IAS 39 categories of held to maturity, available for sale and loans and receivables.
For an investment in an equity instrument that is not held for trading, the standard permits an irrevocable election, on initial recognition, on an individual Share by Share basis, to present all fair value changes from the investment in other comprehensive income.
No amount recognised in other comprehensive income would ever be reclassified to profit or loss.
However, dividends on such investments are recognised in profit or loss, rather than other comprehensive income unless they clearly represent a partial recovery of the cost of the investment.
Investments in equity instruments in respect of which an entity does not elect to present fair value changes in other comprehensive income would be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
The standard requires that derivatives embedded in contracts with a host that is a financial asset within the scope of the standard are not separated: instead the hybrid financial instrument is assessed in its entirety as to whether it should be measured at amortised cost or fair value.
IFRS 9 requires that the effects of changes in credit risk of liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss are presented in other comprehensive income unless such treatment would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch in profit or loss, in which case all gains or losses on that liability are presented in profit or loss.
Other requirements of IFRS 9 relating to classification and measurement of financial liabilities are unchanged from IAS 39.
The requirement of IFRS 9 relating to derecognition are unchanged from IAS 39.
The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.
The Company does not plan to early adopt this standard.
IFRS 10, Consolidated financial statements, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.
The standard provides additional guidance to assist in the determination of control where this is difficult to assess.
The new standard is not expected to have any impact on the Companys financial position or performance.
IFRS 11, Joint Arrangements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, provides for a more realistic reflection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its legal form as is currently the case.
The standard addresses inconsistencies in the reporting of joint arrangements by requiring a single method to account for interests in jointly controlled entities.
IFRS 12, Disclosures of interests in other entities, effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013, includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
The new standard is not expected to have any impact on the Companys financial position or performance but may result in additional disclosures.

Significant accounting policies continued a Applicable new standards and interpretations not yet adopted continued IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement becomes effective for accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
IFRS 13 replaces the fair value measurement guidance spread throughout various IFRSs with a single source.
The standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measurement and sets out disclosures requirements.
The standard does not create any new requirements to measure assets and liabilities at fair value.
The disclosures requirements under IFRS 13 are primarily disclosures currently effective within IFRS 7.
In a majority of circumstances it is expected that IFRS 13 will not result in significantly different fair value estimates to those obtained under currently effective standards.
The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the potential effect of this standard.
The standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the disclosures in the financial statements since the majority of the Companys financial assets are designated at fair value through profit or loss.
b Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss, which are measured at fair value.
The financial statements are prepared in pounds sterling, rounded to the nearest thousand pounds, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
They are prepared on a fair value basis for financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and derivative financial instruments.
Other financial assets and financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost.
As a result of the failure of the Continuation Resolution for the Share class in 2011, the Board put forward a Redemption Proposal to the Shareholders including the creation of a 2011 Redemption Portfolio and with the investments contained within it being realised in an orderly and timely manner, and the cash amounts received being distributed to redeeming Shareholders in full satisfaction of redemption monies.
Therefore, on 31 May 2011 a Continuing Portfolio was created for the Shareholders who decided to remain in the Company and a Redemption Portfolio was created for Shareholders who redeemed.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise amounts payable to redeeming Shareholders and are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Net gains losses on this amount is reflected as a net gain loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
As a result of the Redemption Offer to redeem Shares, a Redemption Portfolio was created.
Management and Directors agreed a split of the portfolio which was allocated to the redeeming Shareholders.
Redemptions will be settled solely out of the realisation of the assets comprised in this Redemption Portfolio.
Consequently there are no reserves in the Redemption Portfolio.
The creation of a Redemption Portfolio does not represent a discontinued operation as defined in IFRS 5.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expense.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Information about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment within the next financial year, as well as critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are included in note 4.
The Companys financial position, cash flow and liquidity position are set out in the financial statements.
In order to provide for short-term settlement timing mis-matches with regard to own share buy backs and operating expenses of the Company it has a secured variable funding note from Credit Suisse International of up to 200 million or 30% of net assets whichever is the lower.
There are no fundamental matters known to the directors that would preclude a renewal on the same or similar terms effective August 2012.
The directors will continue to utilise the authority from the Shareholders to buy back up to 14.99% of own shares to assist with the management of discount control should that become necessary.

The and US$ Share classes did not pass their respective Continuation Votes.
After making sufficient and appropriate enquiries of key service providers, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has and will maintain adequate resources to continue in operation for the forseeable future.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements: c Revenue recognition Interest income, including interest income from non-derivative financial assets through profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Income distributions from investment funds are recognised through profit or loss in the statement of comprehensive income as dividend income when declared.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss i Classification The Company designates all of its investments upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss as they are managed and evaluated on a fair value basis.
These include financial assets that are not held for trading purposes and which may be sold and represent a group of financial assets which is managed and its performance is evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the group is provided internally on that basis to the entitys key management personnel.
These are principally investments in unlisted open-ended hedge funds.
Financial instruments held for trading include forward foreign currency contracts, options and futures contracts.
Financial assets that are classified as loans and receivables include cash and cash equivalents, investment sales awaiting settlements and subscriptions paid in advance.
Financial liabilities that are not at fair value through profit or loss include Treasury Shares awaiting settlement, investment purchases awaiting settlement and accounts payable and accrued expenses.
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include amounts payable to redeeming Shareholders in the Redemption Portfolio.
The table in Note 3 details the categories of financial assets and liabilities held by the Company at the reporting date.
ii Initial Recognition The Company recognises financial assets and financial liabilities on the date it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A regular way purchase of financial instruments is recognised using trade date accounting.
From this date any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities are recorded.
iii Measurement Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value generally the transaction price.
Transaction costs on financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are expensed immediately.
Subsequent to initial recognition, all instruments classified as fair value through profit or loss are measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognised through profit or loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.
Financial liabilities, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.

Significant accounting policies continued e Financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss continued iv Fair value measurement principles Investments in underlying funds which are not quoted on a recognised stock exchange or other trading facility are valued at the NAVs provided by such entities or their administrators.
These values may be unaudited or may themselves be estimates.
When NAVs are not available, those investments will be valued by the Investment Adviser using valuation techniques appropriate to those investments.
In determining fair value, the Investment Adviser takes into consideration, where applicable, the impact of suspensions, of redemptions, liquidation proceedings, investments in side pockets and other significant factors.
Actual values may differ from these estimates.
Open forward foreign currency contracts at the reporting date are valued at forward currency rates at that point.
The unrealised appreciation or depreciation on open forward foreign currency contracts is calculated by reference to the difference between the contracted rate and the rate to close out the contract.
Options are fair valued at last traded market prices.
For open option contracts, changes in the fair value of the contracts are recognised as unrealised gains or losses by fair valuing the contract at the reporting date and are included in the movement in unrealised gain or loss on securities in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
When the contract is closed, the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transaction is recorded as a realised gain or loss.
For open futures contracts, changes in fair value of the contracts are recognised as unrealised gains or losses by marking to market the value of the contract at the reporting date.
When the contract is closed, the difference between the proceeds from or cost of the closing transactions and the original transaction is recorded as a realised gain or loss.
v Realised and unrealised gains and losses Net gains and losses from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss includes all realised and unrealised fair value changes and foreign exchange differences, but excludes interest and dividend income, which are presented separately.
Net realised gains from financial instruments at fair value through profit or loss is calculated using the average cost method.
vi Impairment Financial assets that are stated at amortised cost are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective evidence of impairment.
If any such indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If in a subsequent period the amount of an impairment loss recognised on a financial asset carried at amortised cost decreases and the decrease can be linked objectively to an event occurring after the write-down, the write-down is reversed through the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
vii Derecognition The Company derecognises a financial asset when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or when it transfers the financial asset in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the financial asset are transferred or in which the Company neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and does not retain control of the asset.
A sale of a financial instrument is recognised using trade date accounting.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged, cancelled or expired.
The Company uses the average cost method to determine the realised gain or loss on derecognition of assets.
viii Offsetting Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the Statement of Financial Position when, and only when, the Company has a legal right to set off the recognised amounts and it intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Income and expenses are presented on a net basis only when permitted under IFRSs.

Significant accounting policies continued f Foreign currency transactions The financial statements of the Company are presented in pounds sterling.
The Directors have considered the primary economic currency of the Continuing Portfolio and considered the currency in which the original capital was raised, distributions are to be made and ultimately the currency in which capital would be returned on a break up basis.
The Directors believe that pounds sterling best represents the functional currency.
The functional currency of the Redemption Portfolio is US dollar as the base currency of investments to be realised in the Redemption Portfolio is US dollar.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling for the Continuing Portfolio and US dollar for the Redemption Portfolio at the exchange rate prevailing at the reporting date.
Realised and unrealised gains or losses on currency translation are recognised through profit and loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Foreign currency differences relating to investments at fair value through profit or loss are included in gains and losses on investments note 3. g Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents, which are net of bank overdrafts, are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignificant changes in value.
Cash, deposits with banks and bank overdrafts are stated at their principal amount.
h Issue costs Expenses associated with the issue of ordinary Shares other than those arising on the issue or conversion of C Shares are written off against Share premium.
During the year, there were no ordinary Shares issued.
i Treasury Shares Where the Company purchases its own Share capital whether into treasury or for cancellation, the consideration paid, which includes any directly attributable costs net of income taxes is recognised as a deduction from equity Shareholders funds through the special reserve, which is a distributable reserve.
When such Shares are subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is recognised as an increase in equity, and the resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is transferred to from the special reserve.
Shares held in treasury are not taken into account in determining NAV per Share detailed in Note 9 and profit loss per Share detailed in Note 12. j Share Capital The Company classifies financial instruments issued as financial liabilities or equity instruments in accordance with the substance of the contractual terms of the instruments.
Income, expenses, gains and losses are allocated to each Share class based on the percentage each Share class net asset value represents of the total net asset value of the Company.
Class specific expenses and gains losses on forward foreign currency contracts used to hedge foreign exchange exposure on specific Share classes are allocated to those Share classes.
The Company has three classes of Shares in issue:, and US$ that rank pari passu in all material respects and have the same terms and conditions.
The Shares provide investors with the right to require redemption for cash in certain circumstances at a value proportionate to the investors share in the Companys net assets, after deduction of the nominal amount of equity Share Capital, at each redemption date and also in the event of the Companys liquidation.
Shares in the Continuing Portfolio are classified as equity as notwithstanding that these Shares have some characteristics of liabilities, the Directors can exercise discretion in respect of the manner of redemption and conversion of these Shares.
Shares in the Redemption Portfolio are classified as liabilities as following the failure of the Continuation vote for Shares these amounts are payable to the Shareholders who redeemed their Shares.

Financial Risk Management The Continuing Portfolio seeks to achieve its investment objective through investment in an actively managed portfolio of hedge funds, diversified by investment strategy, style and manager, in order to achieve attractive risk-adjusted returns, with little correlation to equity and fixed interest benchmarks.
The Redemption Portfolio seeks to achieve its objective of realising its assets in an orderly way to pay redeeming Shareholders.
At the date of this report 88% of the Redemption Portfolio has been paid to redeeming Shareholders.
Of the remaining 12%, 3.5% US$6m is invested in side pockets that have no definitive redemption date.
a Capital risk management The Company manages its capital to ensure that it is able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to equity holders through the optimisation of equity balance.
The capital structure of the Company consists of Shareholders equity which comprises issued Share capital, and other reserves.
The Company adheres to the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority.
At each Annual General Meeting AGM the Directors seek authority from Shareholders to buy back own Company shares of up to 14.99% of the issued share capital in issue with voting rights as at the date of each AGM.
This authority enables the Directors to assist in the management of the market discount.
The Articles of Association incorporate discount management provisions requiring a continuation vote to be proposed by way of an ordinary class resolution if, in any rolling 12 month period, the Shares have traded, on average, at a discount equal to or in excess of 5% of the average NAV per Share by reference to the weekly NAV estimates released in that period and the closing mid-market Share price 5 business days after each such estimate is released.
If a Continuation Vote is not passed the Directors are required to formulate proposals to be put to Shareholders within 2 months of such failure, offering a redemption of the Shares held in the Company or alternative action with substantially equivalent economic effect.
The techniques and instruments utilised for the purposes of efficient portfolio management are those which are reasonably believed by the Investment Adviser to be economically appropriate to the efficient management of the Company.
The Companys financial instruments include cash, investments in funds, currency hedging, and future contracts.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, currency risk and liquidity risk.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to moderate certain risk exposures.

Financial Risk Management continued b Market price risk management Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes currency risk, interest rate risk and price risk.
Price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents both gains and losses suffered through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Continuing Portfolio and the Redemption Portfolio are exposed to market price fluctuations which are monitored by the Investment Adviser in pursuance of its investment objective and policy.
The Investment Adviser manages price risk through adherence to the Continuing Portfolios investment restrictions set out below which mitigates the risk of excessive exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Not more than 20% of the total assets of the Company will be invested in any one fund at the time the investment is made.
The Company will not make further investment s in any single investment strategy where, immediately following such further investment s, that investment strategy represents 60% or more of the total assets of the Company.
The Company will not borrow more than 40% of its net assets for short term or temporary liquidity purposes, including as may be necessary to facilitate investment and withdrawals from underlying funds or to meet ongoing expenses and to implement the Companys currency hedging strategy.
The Company will avoid cross-financing between businesses forming part of its investment portfolio.
The Company will avoid the operation of common treasury functions as between the Company and investee companies.
Any material change in the investment policies of the Company will only be made with the approval of Shareholders by ordinary resolution.
Not more than 10% of the total assets of the Company in aggregate will be invested in other closed-ended investment funds except for those which themselves have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15% of their gross assets in other closed-ended investment funds.
The portfolios consist of a diversified portfolio of hedge funds which are managed using different hedge fund strategies.
The hedge fund strategies used are described on page 64.
Details of the top 10 holdings of the Continuing and Redemption Portfolios are on pages 44 and 45.
Details of the nature and terms of derivative financial instruments outstanding at the statement of financial position date are set out in note 13.
Price Sensitivity Analysis If the price of the underlying hedge funds increased decreased by 10% the net asset value and profit for the year for the Continuing Portfolio would increase decrease by 64,251,343 2010: 85,767,449.
If the price of the underlying hedge funds increased decreased by 10% the investments at the year end for the Redemption Portfolio would increase decrease by 770,247 2010: N A.
Actual trading results may differ from the above sensitivity analysis.
c Interest rate risk management Substantially all of the Companys assets are non-interest bearing investments and its exposure to interest rate changes is limited.
The Continuing Portfolio has cash and cash equivalents of 19,068,400 2010: 36,112,343, and has a bank overdraft of 69,586,956 2010: 61,706,505 at the year end and is therefore subject to cashflow interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The short term investments included within cash equivalents and bank overdraft have an overnight maturity, and as a result they have a limited exposure to fair value interest rate risk due to fluctuations in the prevailing levels of market interest rates.
The Redemption Portfolio has cash and cash equivalents of 1,736,498.

Financial Risk Management continued d Credit risk management Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
Credit risk is generally higher when a non-exchange traded financial instrument is involved because the counterparty for non-exchange traded financial instruments is not backed by an exchange clearing house.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk on the financial assets with its brokers.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represent the maximum credit risk exposure at the statement of financial position date.
This relates also to financial assets carried at amortised cost, as they have a short-term to maturity.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: Continuing Redemption Company Company Portfolio Portfolio Total Total 2011 2011 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss 642,513 7,702 650,215 857,674 Cash and cash equivalents 19,068 1,736 20,804 36,112 Financial assets held for trading 126 126 929,244 Sales awaiting settlement 67,890 12,460 80,350 62,956 Subscriptions paid in advance 48,662 48,662 Other receivables 23 23 4 Total 778,282 21,898 800,180 1,885,990 Transactions involving over-the-counter derivative financial instruments are usually with counterparties with whom the Company has signed master trading agreements for example, ISDA Master Agreements.
Master trading agreements typically provide for the net settlement of contracts with the same counterparty on the settlement date.
Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered small due to the short settlement period involved and the credit quality of the brokers used.
Investments made by the Company and the funds in which it invests may not be regulated by the rules of any stock exchange or investment exchange or other regulatory body or authority.
The counterparties to such investments have no obligation to make markets in such investments.
Furthermore, the Company will be subject to the risk of bankruptcy of, or the inability or refusal to perform with respect to such investments by, the counterparties with which the Company deals.
The Investment Adviser carries out due diligence procedures before investing in an underlying managers fund.
Procedures are also in place to monitor the managers on a regular basis, thereby ensuring that the Company limits its exposure to credit risk on its underlying funds.
The Company monitors the credit rating and financial positions of the brokers used to further mitigate this risk.
Substantially all of the assets of the Company are held by Northern Trust Guernsey Limited.
All assets of the Company are segregated in the name of the Company at the Custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the Custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the Custodian to be delayed or limited.

Consequently the Continuing Portfolio is exposed to risks that the exchange rate of its currency relative to other foreign currencies may change in a manner that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of the Continuing Portfolios assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Continuing Portfolios operating activities include investing in derivative financial instruments that involve varying degrees of currency risk.
The derivative contracts that the Continuing Portfolio holds from time to time are forward contracts on foreign currencies for hedging non-sterling Share classes, an index option and futures contracts.
Details of forward contracts on foreign currencies and futures contracts held at 31 December 2011 are set out in note 13.
The Redemption Portfolio has no material currency exposure.
The Continuing Portfolios currency risk is managed on a daily basis by the Investment Adviser in accordance with policies and procedures in place as outlined in the prospectus of the Company.

f Liquidity risk management The Company may not be able to liquidate at short notice some of its investments in instruments at an amount close to their carrying value in order to meet liquidity requirements.
However, the Investment Advisor believes that a significant portion of the investments in the Continuing Portfolio can be redeemed at NAV, subject to notice periods being adhered to.
From time to time, the counterparties with which the Company effects transactions might cease making markets or quoting prices in certain of the instruments.
In such instances, the Company might be unable to enter into a desired transaction in currencies or other financial instruments, or to enter into any offsetting transaction with respect to an open position, which might adversely affect its performance.
Similarly, it may not always be possible for the Company to execute a buy or sell order on exchanges at the desired price or to liquidate an open position either due to market conditions or due to the operation of daily price fluctuation limits the maximum fluctuation permitted by some exchanges in the price of a futures or options contract during any trading day.
If trading on an exchange is suspended or restricted, the Company may not be able to execute trades or close out positions on terms which the Investment Adviser believes are desirable.
The Investment Adviser manages liquidity risk in accordance with the Companys investment restrictions, its committed facilities that include provision for settlement timing mismatches and also have access to the Custodian position reports by an on-line system.
Upon raising fresh capital, the Manager seeks to arrange increased facilities as required.
On a quarterly basis or more frequently, if deemed appropriate the Board reviews and considers the overall liquidity risk of the portfolio.

Financial Risk Management continued g Fair value measurements IFRS 7 requires the Company to classify fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurements.
IFRS 7 establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritises the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3 measurements.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7 are as follows: Level 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices : Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety is determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
For this purpose, the significance of an input is assessed against the fair value measurement in its entirety.
If a fair value measurement uses observable inputs that require significant adjustment based on unobservable inputs, that measurement is a Level 3 measurement.
Assessing the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgement, considering factors specific to the asset or liability.
The determination of what constitutes observable requires significant judgement by the Company.
The Company considers observable data to be that market data that is readily available, regularly distributed or updated, reliable and verifiable, not proprietary, and provided by independent sources that are actively involved in the relevant market.
