2 Litigation The group has a number of activities in a wide variety of geographic areas and is subject to certain legal claims incidental to its operations.
Inthe opinion of the directors, after taking appropriate legal advice, these claims are not expected to have, either individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect upon the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
These include claims made by certain former employees in Ecuador arising out of events which took place before the groups investment in Ecuador in 2005, in respect of which, based on legal advice that they have no valid legal basis, the directors have determined that no provision is required and that they should continue to be contested.
Other SABMiller and Altria entered into a tax matters agreement the Agreement on 30 May 2002, to regulate the conduct of tax matters between them with regard to the acquisition of Miller and to allocate responsibility for contingent tax costs.
SABMiller has agreed to indemnify Altria against any taxes, losses, liabilities and costs that Altria incurs arising out of or in connection with a breach by SABMiller of any representation, agreement or covenant in the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
The group has exposures to various environmental risks.
