Share capital continued Rights and restrictions relating to share capital Convertible participating shares Altria is entitled to require the company to convert its ordinary shares into convertible participating shares so as to ensure that Altrias voting shareholding does not exceed 24.99% of the total voting shareholding.
If such an event occurs, the convertible participating shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares in all respects and no action shall be taken by the company in relation to ordinary shares unless the same action is taken in respect of the convertible participating shares.
On distribution of the profits whether by cash dividend, dividend in specie, scrip dividend, capitalisation issue or otherwise, the convertible participating shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares.
On a return of capital whether winding-up or otherwise, the convertible participating shares will rank pari passu with the ordinary shares.
Altria is entitled to vote its convertible participating shares at general meetings of the company on a poll on the basis of one-tenth of a vote for every convertible participating share on all resolutions other than a resolution: i proposed by any person other than Altria, to wind-up the company: ii proposed by any person other than Altria, to appoint an administrator or to approve any arrangement with the companys creditors: iii proposed by the board, to sell all or substantially all of the undertaking of the company: or iv p roposed by any person other than Altria, to alter any of the class rights attaching to the convertible participating shares or to approve the creation of any new class of shares, in which case Altria shall be entitled on a poll to vote on the resolution on the basis of one vote for each convertible participating share, but, for the purposes of any resolution other than a resolution mentioned in iv above, the convertible participating shares shall be treated as being of the same class as the ordinary shares and no separate meeting or resolution of the holders of the convertible participating shares shall be required to be convened or passed.
Upon a transfer of convertible participating shares by Altria other than to an affiliate, such convertible participating shares shall convert into ordinary shares.
Altria is entitled to require the company to convert its convertible participating shares into ordinary shares if: i a t hird party has made a takeover offer for the company and if such offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects it would result in the voting shareholding of the third party being more than 30% of the total voting shareholding: and ii A ltria has communicated to the company in writing its intention not itself to make an offer competing with such third party offer, provided that the conversion date shall be no earlier than the date on which the third partys offer becomes or is declared unconditional in all respects.
Altria is entitled to require the company to convert its convertible participating shares into ordinary shares if the voting shareholding of a third party should be more than 24.99%, provided that: i t he number of ordinary shares held by Altria following such conversion shall be limited to one ordinary share more than the number of ordinary shares held by the third party: and ii s uch conversion shall at no time result in Altrias voting shareholding being equal to or greater than the voting shareholding which would require Altria to make a mandatory offer in terms of rule 9 of the City Code.
If Altria wishes to acquire additional ordinary shares other than pursuant to a pre-emptive issue of new ordinary shares or with the prior approval of the board, Altria shall first convert into ordinary shares the lesser of: i s uch number of convertible participating shares as would result in Altrias voting shareholding being such percentage as would, in the event of Altria subsequently acquiring one additional ordinary share, require Altria to make a mandatory offer in terms of rule 9 of the City Code: and ii a ll of its remaining convertible participating shares.

A total of 46.2 million new shares in The South African Breweries Limited SAB, representing 8.45% of SABs enlarged issued share capital, were issued.
The shares in SAB will be exchanged at the end of the estimated ten-year scheme term for shares in SABMiller plc based on a repurchase formula linked, inter alia, to the operating performance of SAB.
No performance conditions and exercise prices are attached to these shares, although the employee component has a four-year vesting period.
The weighted average fair value of each SAB share at the grant date was ZAR40.
Weighted average fair value assumptions The fair value of services received in return for share awards granted is measured by reference to the fair value of share awards granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a binomial model approach except for the awards under Performance Share Award schemes, the Executive Share Award Plan 2008 including value share awards and the BBBEE scheme which have been valued using Monte Carlo simulations.
The Monte Carlo simulation methodology is necessary for valuing share-based payments with TSR performance hurdles.
This is achieved byprojecting SABMiller plcs share price forwards, together with those of companies in the same comparator group, over the vesting period and or life of the awards after considering their respective volatilities.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in these option pricing models during the year.
2011 2010 Share price South African share option scheme ZAR 226.66 204.19 BBBEE scheme SAB share price ZAR 162.68 All other schemes 19.49 12.23 Exercise price South African share option scheme ZAR 222.55 203.64 All other schemes 8.80 7.21 2 Expected volatility BBBEE scheme 27.1% All other schemes 29.2% 30.6% Dividend yield BBBEE scheme 4.9% All other schemes 2.5% 4.0% Annual forfeiture rate South African share option scheme 5.0% 5.0% All other schemes 3.0% 3.0% Risk-free interest rate South African share option scheme 8.7% 9.0% BBBEE scheme 8.3% All other schemes 2.9% 2.9% 1 The calculation is based on the weighted fair value of issues made during the year.
