com Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Operating segments The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Groups strategic business units.
Car Servicing became a reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010.
The strategic business units offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing strategies.
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores.
The operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from autocentres.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors.
Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the Executive Directors on a monthly basis.
Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit.
Management believes that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions.
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Groups reportable segments.
Performance is measured based on segment operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors.
These internal reports are prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements.
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK.
The Groups revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major customer or group of customers.
All revenue is from external customers.

Non-recurring items For the period 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 1 April 2011 2 April 2010 m m Non-recurring operating expenses: 1 Lease guarantee provision 7.5 2 Central Europe closure 7.4 Non-recurring items before tax 7.5 7.4 3 Tax on non-recurring items 2.1 1.4 Non-recurring items after tax 5.4 6.0 1 A non-recurring expense of 7.5m was incurred in the year.
This expense relates to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities arising from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989.
An estimate of the potential liability relating to these guarantees was previously disclosed as a contingent liability in the Interim financial statements.
The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased by Payless DIY now part of Focus DIY when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under the ownership of the Ward White Group.
Focus DIY entered into administration in May 2011.
2 Exit costs associated with the closure of all seven stores in Central Europe.
Results for Central Europe for the period was 1.9m 2010: 5.9m, generating an operating loss before non recurring items of 0.4m 2010: 2.5m.
3 This represents the tax credit at 28% on these non-recurring costs: in 2010 this credit was lower than the UK corporation tax standard rate of 28% due to the non-deductibility of certain legal expenses and depreciation associated with store infrastructure.

Taxation For the period 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 1 April 2011 2 April 2010 m m Current taxation UK corporation tax charge for the period 35.7 35.5 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 4.1 1.1 31.6 34.4 Deferred taxation Origination and reversal of timing differences 0.2 2.5 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 1.2 0.8 1.0 1.7 Total tax charge for the period 32.6 32.7 The tax charge is reconciled with the standard rate of UK corporation tax as follows: For the period 52 weeks to 52 weeks to 1 April 2011 2 April 2010 m m Profit before tax 118.1 109.7 UK corporation tax at standard rate of 28% 2010: 28% 33.1 30.7 Factors affecting the charge for the period: Depreciation on expenditure not eligible for tax relief 1.2 1.8 Employee share options 1.2 0.2 Non-taxable income 0.7 Other disallowable expenses 0.7 0.7 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 2.9 0.3 Total tax charge for the period 32.6 32.7 On 22 June 2010 the Chancellor announced that the main rate of UK corporation tax will reduce from 28% to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011.
This tax change became substantively enacted in July 2010 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction on the deferred tax balances as at 1 April 2011 has been included in the figures above.
On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor announced a further reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
This change became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and therefore the effect of the rate reduction has been reflected in the figures above as it was substantively enacted prior to the balance sheet date.
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014, but these changes have not yet been substantively enacted.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of this further 3% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future current tax charge and reduce the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities accordingly.
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax standard rate was 28% 2010: 28%.
The effective tax rate of 27.6% 2010: 29.8% differs from the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure, the reassessment of anticipated future tax deductions from employee share schemes and the reassessment of historic tax provisions required against tax uncertainties.
The tax charge of 32.6m 2010: 32.7m includes a credit of 2.1m 2010: 1.4m in respect of the tax on non-recurring costs, as detailed in note 5.
An income tax credit of 1.1m 2010: 0.6m charge on other comprehensive income relates to the fair value of forward currency contracts outstanding at the year end.
No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.

It will be paid on 6 August 2011 to shareholders who are on the register of members on 1 July 2011.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust see note 21 and has been adjusted for the issue purchase of shares during the period.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011.

Acquisition of subsidiary undertaking in prior year On 17 February 2010 the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Nationwide Autocentres Holdings Limited and subsidiary undertakings Nationwide Autocentres for cash consideration of 74.9m including transaction costs of 2.6m.
Nationwide Autocentres, now Halfords Autocentres, is a group of companies involved in car servicing and repair.
This transaction was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Preacquisition Recognised carrying Fair value values on amounts adjustments acquisition m m m Acquirees net assets at the acquisition date Property, plant and equipment 5.4 0.2 5.2 Intangible assets 18.2 18.2 Inventories 1.2 1.2 Trade and other receivables 5.7 5.7 Trade and other payables 16.6 0.4 17.0 Provisions 0.7 1.7 2.4 Current tax liabilities 0.9 0.4 1.3 Deferred tax liabilities 0.3 4.7 4.4 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 5.6 10.8 5.2 Goodwill on acquisition see note 11 69.7 Consideration paid 74.9 The fair value adjustments primarily relate to intangible assets in respect of customer relationships and favourable leases, see note 11.
There have been no subsequent changes to the fair value of the net assets acquired at the time of purchase.
Contingent consideration The cash consideration payable for the acquisition was reduced by 1.7m to reflect additional cash consideration payable to certain shareholders remaining as Directors, contingent on their remaining as employees of the Group as of the first and second anniversary of the acquisition or, in the event of any of them having terminated their employment, said employment having been terminated in circumstances of being a good leaver.
1.0m of the additional cash consideration was payable on 17 February 2011 and was settled on that date.
The remaining 0.7m is payable on 17 February 2012.
The deferred consideration of 0.9m has been settled in the year.

Included in computer software are internally generated assets of 0.3m 2010: 0.4m.
Product rights of 0.2m, which are fully amortised, have been included within Brand names and trademarks.
Goodwill of 253.1m arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is allocated to the Retail segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cashgenerating units.
Goodwill of 69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 and is allocated to the car servicing segment.
The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to a future income to be generated from new retail, fleet customer contracts and related relationships, b the Nationwide workforce, c the value of immaterial other intangible assets and d operating synergies.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on value-in-use calculations for each of the two groups of cash-generating units, being Retail and Car Servicing.
This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, which is not higher than the Groups operating segments as reported in note 1.
These calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period with growth no higher than past experience and after consideration of all available information and expectations for future market developments.
The key assumptions, to which the Group of cash-generating units recoverable amounts are most sensitive, used to determine value-in-use of goodwill held at 1 April 2011 and 2 April 2010 are as follows: Retail Car Servicing Notes 2011 2010 2011 2010 Discount rate 1 14.2% 12.2% 14.9% 13.9% Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% Notes: 1.
Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.

The Group has renegotiated its debt facility with effect from 5 November 2010 and secured a four-year 300m revolving credit facility from that date with an option to extend by a further year.
While variable in line with the level of Group debt, at the Groups optimal gearing level of 1.5 EBITDA, the facility carries an interest margin of approximately 200bps.
With revised facilities in place the Board has determined that it has sufficient working capital and undrawn financing facilities to service its operating activities and ongoing capital investments following the signing.
The Board retains its preference for financial flexibility and lower gearing whilst pursuing high return investments.
Accordingly the Groups pro forma gearing at the end of the period was 0.7 EBITDA.

The distribution reorganisation provision represents the costs associated with the re-configuration and consolidation of the Groups distribution and warehousing infrastructure.
Property related provisions consist of costs associated with vacant property, rent reviews and dilapidations.
Also included in the current period are 7.5m of non-recurring costs note 5 relating to liabilities in respect of previous assignments of leases where the lessee has entered into administration subsequent to the period end.
Other trading provisions comprises a sales returns provision and a provision for the costs associated with the cessation of the stand-alone cycle concept, including closure of stores where necessary.
Restructuring provisions A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either has commenced or has been announced publicly.
Future operating losses are not provided for.
Key assumptions within the Central Europe exit and Distribution reorganisation provisions were the timing of the exit from leases that were contracted into, the timing of redundancies and the extent of dilapidation costs.
The sensitivities to these assumptions were not considered material due to the time value of money being minimal over the period over which the costs would be incurred.
Property related provisions A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
The main uncertainty is the timing of the amounts payable, and the time value of money has been incorporated into the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
A rent review provision is recognised when there is expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of the Groups unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts.
The provision is based on managements best estimate of the rent payable after the review.
Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred.
Sensitivity to this uncertainty is not expected to be material to the provision in total.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there is an expectation of future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties arising from events such as lease renewals or terminations.
Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due.

Financial instruments and related disclosures Treasury policy The Groups treasury departments main responsibilities are to: Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group: Manage the interest risk of the Groups debt: Invest surplus cash: Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group: and Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Finance Director FD.
The FD controls policy and performance through the line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee.
The Treasury Committee meets regularly to monitor the performance of the Treasury function.
Monthly Treasury Reports provide management information relating to treasury activity.
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis.
The Groups debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group.
The Group has a syndicated four-year revolving credit facility totalling 300m that provides the Group with committed bank facilities until November 2014, which are extendable by a further year.
The Business Plan and cash flow forecasts are subject to key assumptions such as interest rates and the significance of these risks is dependent upon the level of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation and the strength of the balance sheet.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows: Market risk The Groups exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk.
These are discussed further below.
Commodity risk is due to the Groups products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials whose prices fluctuate.
The Group mitigates this risk through, for example, transferring the risk to suppliers by negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest rate risk The Groups policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants.
The Groups borrowings are currently subject to floating rate and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market.
At the reporting date the interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments was: Financial liabilities 2011 2010 Carrying Carrying amount amount m m Finance leases 11.8 12.0 Variable rate instruments 90.0 180.0 101.8 192.0 The Group does not account for any fixed rate financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss: therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss or equity.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to interest rates changes: 2011 2011 2010 2010 Increase in Reduction in Increase in Reduction in finance cost equity finance cost equity m m m m 1% increase in sterling interest rates 0.9 1.8 A 1% decrease in interest rates would have an equal and opposite effect.
The movement in the income statement reflects the effect on finance costs on the unhedged borrowings of the Group as shown in the table.
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do not present a material exposure to the Groups balance sheet.

Financial instruments and related disclosures continued Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing, direct sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the trade being in US dollars.
The Groups policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% excluding increases in the base cost of the product.
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2011, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75%80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 12-month basis.
Hedging is performed through the use of foreign currency bank accounts, monitoring of spot rates and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows based on notional amounts: 1 April 2011 2 April 2010 GBP USD Other GBP USD Other m m m m m m Cash and cash equivalents 6.0 1.4 33.7 0.1 2.7 Trade and other receivables 42.0 42.9 Long-term borrowings 90.0 180.0 Trade and other payables 128.1 13.6 0.3 116.2 15.0 0.3 182.1 13.6 1.1 219.6 14.9 2.4 The following significant exchange rates applied during the current and prior period: Reporting date Average rate spot rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 USD 1.56 1.60 1.60 1.53 EUR 1.18 1.13 1.13 1.13 The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the Groups derivatives are denominated.
2011 2010 Increase Increase decrease decrease in equity in equity m m 10% appreciation of the US dollar 11.0 8.4 10% depreciation of the US dollar 8.7 7.5 A strengthening of sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 1 April 2011 would have increased decreased equity and profit or loss by the amounts shown above.
This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain constant.
There are no material movements in the income statement.
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Groups forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.

com Credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2011 2010 m m Cash and cash equivalents 2.7 36.5 1 Loans and receivables 12.5 15.5 Forward exchange contracts used for hedging assets 0.3 3.0 Total financial assets 15.5 55.0 The 12.5m 2010: 15.5m maximum exposure to credit risk, at the reporting date for loans and receivables related to the UK.
The Group does not have any individually significant customers.
The following table shows the age of such financial assets that are past due and for which no provision for bad or doubtful debts has been raised: 2011 2010 m m Not past due 10.0 12.7 Past due by 130 days 0.9 1.4 Past due by 3190 days 1.3 0.6 Past due by 91180 days 0.3 0.8 12.5 15.5 The Group believes that the unimpaired amounts that are past due by more than 30 days are still collectable, based on historic payment behaviour and extensive analysis of the underlying customers credit ratings.
Based on historic default rates, the Group believes that, apart from the above, no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
Liquidity risk The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan.
The minimum liquidity level is currently set at 30.0m, such that under Treasury Policy the maximum drawings would be 270m of the 300m available facility.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an A credit rating at the time of refinancing November 2010.
Ancillary business, in the main, is directed to the five banks within the club banking group.
At the time of the drawdown of the bank facility in November 2010 all banks within the club were A grade.
The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would lead to an Event of Default.
Calculations are submitted bi-annually to the Club bank agent.
Reporting on covenant compliance forms part of the Treasury Report.
There have been no breaches of covenants during the reported periods.

Liquidity risk is managed through regular review of the forthcoming cash requirements, and use of the available borrowing facilities when needed.
Fair value disclosures The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions: Trade receivables, trade payables and finance The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity lease obligations, short-term deposits and of these instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long-term finance lease borrowings obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the closing spot rate at the balance sheet date and the outright contract rate.

com Fair value hierarchy Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels: Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
Cash flow hedges Forward currency contracts Forward dated foreign exchange contracts are undertaken to hedge known exposure to foreign purchases in US dollars.
The fair value of such derivatives is shown in the table on page 128.
Borrowing facilities The Group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available during the period in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2011 2010 m m Expiring within 1 year 1.0 1.0 Expiring between 1 and 2 years 120.0 Expiring between 2 and 5 years 210.0 211.0 121.0 The facilities expiring within one year were annual facilities subject to review at various dates during the period.
The facility of 210.0m relates to the Groups revolving credit facility.
All these facilities incurred commitment fees at market rates.
Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Between June 2006 and September 2009, the Group managed its capital structure partly through a share buy-back scheme and a new share buy-back scheme was initiated on 7 April 2011.
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios.
These ratios are lease adjusted net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation EBITDA and fixed charge cover.
Lease adjusted net debt is calculated as being net debt and leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges.
Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of interest and operating lease charges.
As a result of the current economic conditions and the attitude towards debt the Group has decided to reduce the level of net debt and operates favourably to these target metrics.

Share-based payments The Group has three share award plans: 1.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme CSOS 2.
Halfords Company Share Option Scheme The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since.
Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant.
The contractual life of an option is ten years.
Options granted will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a three-year performance condition.
For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share EPS over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 5% per year for the 2005 scheme and 3.5% for options granted subsequently.
In the case of grants in excess of 150% of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year.
Exercise of an option is subject to continued employment.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004.
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise.
The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds.
Options were valued using the BlackScholes option-pricing models.
No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.

Halfords Sharesave Scheme The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service.
Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company.

Performance Share Plan The introduction of a Performance Share Plan PSP was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the executive Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares.
Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Companys performance over the three-year period following the award date.
The vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR performance and the vesting of the other 50% by the Companys absolute EPS performance against RPI.
The Companys TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 general retailers as a comparator group.
No retesting will be permitted.
The TSR element of the options granted under the 2007 scheme has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte.
The Deloitte model uses the Groups share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo model.
For the 2006 scheme the TSR element of the options were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model.
The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation were as follows: 3 August 3 August 7 August 12 July Grant date 2010 2009 2008 2007 Share price at grant date 4.8550 3.4583 2.962 4.02 Number of employees 25 20 20 21 Shares under option 320,288 824,927 866,340 539,893 Shares representing dividends reinvested 6,524 38,957 Vesting period years 3 3 3 3 Expected volatility 41% 41% 30% 22% Option life years 3 3 3 3 Expected life years 3 3 3 3 Expected dividend yield 4.08% 4.49% 4.83% 4.10% Possibility of ceasing employment before vesting 30% 30% 30% 30% Expectations of meeting performance criteria 100% 100% 100% 100% Fair value per option 3.65 2.74 1.97 2.69 Expired during the period 13,865 19,203 18,046 Forfeited during the period 128,687 Number of shares outstanding 1 April 2011 326,542 734,171 691,417 Share options exercised during the period by scheme grant date: 2011 2010 Exercise Number of Number of price shares shares 11 July 2006 0.00 311,716 12 July 2007 0.00 39,168 295,700 7 August 2008 0.00 86,099 125,267 607,416 As the PSP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value and therefore is excluded from the above table.
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares.
This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive remuneration.
Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2009 under the Performance Share Plan earned final dividends of 14p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of 4.81 per share.
Shares awarded in both 2009 and 2010 under the PSP earned interim dividends of 8p per share and were reinvested in shares at cost of 4.10 per share 18559 20 06 2011 Proof 6 Halfords Group plc Online version 135 Annual Report & Accounts for period ended 1 April 2011 halfords.
