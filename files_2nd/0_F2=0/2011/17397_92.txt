On 9 September 2010 the Company passed a resolution adopting new articles of association.

Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plans Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2006 onwards A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
There are different performance targets for different categories of management.
Awards made to executive directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the start of the performance period.
Full vesting of this portion of the award will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking, with pro-rata vesting for intermediate performance.
No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the award made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Companys real growth in normalised earnings per share EPS over the performance period.
For the 2006 and subsequent awards, the growth target required the increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index RPI in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting: if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI then there will be no vesting.
A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition.
As a general rule, awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited.
In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest.
