Page 36 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 PRINCIPAL ACTIVITY The principal activity of the Company is that of an investment trust company within the meaning of Section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys annual financial statements for the period from 19 April 2010 to 31 March 2011 have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union, and with the Association of Investment Companies AIC Statement of Recommended Practice SORP.
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these financial statements are summarised below.
All of the Companys activities are inter-related and each activity is dependent on the others.
Accordingly, all significant operating decisions are based upon analysis of the Company as one segment and therefore segmental information is not required.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Changes in accounting policy and disclosures At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective 1 January 2013 : Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets Amendments to IFRS 7 effective 1 July 2011 : and Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes effective 1 January 2012.
It is anticipated that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material financial impact on the financial statements of the Company.
However, additional disclosures may be necessary and will be considered on their application.
c Presentation of the Income Statement In order to better reflect the activities of an investment trust company and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been prepared alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under Section 833 of the Companies Act 2006, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividends.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the Directors believe appropriate in assessing the Companys compliance with certain requirements set out in Section 1159 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010. d Revenue Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established, normally the ex-dividend date.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Where appropriate certain derivatives, such as contracts for difference, are used.
Income derived from these is included in the revenue column in the Income Statement.
e Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
f Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged as follows: Any performance fee due is allocated entirely to capital, as the Board believes it reflects capital performance of the Companys investments: The investment management fee and finance costs are allocated equally between revenue and capital: and All other expenses are allocated in full to revenue with the exception of those directly attributable to share issues.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Page 37 Notes to the Financial Statements g Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of taxation currently payable and deferred taxation.
Taxation currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from profit before taxation as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Companys liability for current taxation is calculated using taxation rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the taxation expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding taxation bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment companies which have approval as such under section 1158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred taxation assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the taxation rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred taxation is charged in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in equity.
h Foreign currency The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
i Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value, which is taken to be their cost.
Subsequently, the investments are valued at fair value, which is measured as bid or last prices depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, where available, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations.
In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes transaction costs within investment movements and has disclosed them in Note 10 on page 43. j Derivative instruments Where appropriate, certain permitted transactions involving derivative instruments are used.
Derivative transactions into which the Company may enter include forward currency contracts, CFDs, futures and options, and are measured at fair value.
The fair value is the quoted trade price for the contract.
Where such transactions are used to increase portfolio returns, if the circumstances support this, then the income and expenses derived from them are included in net derivative income via the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included in losses on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the period end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within current assets and current liabilities.
Premiums received on written options are taken to capital and are recognised within the gains losses on derivative instruments via the capital column of the Income Statement.
CFDs are measured at fair value which is the difference between the settlement price and the value of the underlying shares in the contract.
All gains and losses in the fair value of the CFDs are included in losses on derivative instruments held at fair value through profit or loss in the capital return column of the Income Statement and are calculated in accordance with accounting policy 2 i.
Income received from dividends on CFDs and derivative expenses related to them are included in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Page 38 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements k Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash at bank.
Cash equivalents are short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
l Loans Loans are initially included in the financial statements at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, net of any issue costs relating to the borrowing.
After initial recognition, the loans are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
The amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
m Capital reserve The following are accounted for in capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments, including derivatives: Changes in the fair value of investments, including derivatives, held at the period end: Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Performance fee: 50% of the investment management fee: 50% of finance costs: and Dividends receivable which are capital in nature.
As a result of technical guidance by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10: Distributable Profits, changes in fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Balance Sheet.
At the balance sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash.
n Dividends Dividends payable to equity shareholders are recognised when the Companys obligation to make payment is established.
o Share issue costs Costs incurred directly in relation to the offer for subscription and placing of ordinary shares and the C share offer together with additional share listing costs have been deducted from equity.
All other costs not directly attributable to the share issues have been charged to revenue.

In addition, the Investment Managers are entitled to an annual performance fee of 15% of any change in the NAV attributable to performance which is more than 2% above the returns on the MSCI China Index subject to a maximum performance fee payable in any year equal to 1.5% of the arithmetic mean of the value of net assets calculated at the end of each month during the year.
Any outperformance above this cap will be carried forward.
If the Company underperforms 2% above the returns on the MSCI China Index in any year, the underperformance must be made good before any further performance fee becomes payable in future years.
Both the NAV and the MSCI China Index will be calculated on a total return basis, and the NAV will be based on the weighted average number of shares in issue.
For the period from 19 April 2010 to 31 March 2011, although the NAV outperformed the Index it did not do so by more than 2%.
Therefore, no performance fee is payable.

The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
Market price risk Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through price movements in its investment positions.
The Managers are responsible for actively monitoring the portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly to do with underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in accordance with the Companys Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
The Board meets quarterly to review the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing was provided by a 364 day revolving credit facility for HK$ 775,000,000, or the equivalent amount in other currencies entered into on 19 April 2010.
This facility was amended on 1 April 2011 into a 364 day revolving credit facility for US$ 150,000,000, or the equivalent in other currencies.
The Company is exposed, therefore, to a fair value interest rate risk if interest rates change.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The Company is exposed to cash flow interest risk on forward currency contracts, cash at bank and amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers.
The Company was exposed to a fair value interest rate risk on the fixed rate bank loan of US$ 99,500,000 at 31 March 2011.
The net exposure to forward currency contracts is shown in Note 11 on page 44 and cash at bank and amounts held at futures clearing houses and brokers are shown in the Balance Sheet on page 35.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Page 47 Notes to the Financial Statements Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and balance sheet can be affected by exchange rate movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency which is sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: movements in exchange rates affecting the value of investments and the bank loan movements in exchange rates affecting short term timing differences movements in exchange rates affecting income received The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
Financial assets The Companys financial assets comprise equity investments, derivative instruments, short term debtors and cash.
The currency profile of these financial assets as at 31 March 2011 is shown below.

Page 48 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements Financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital, reserves and borrowings.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise derivative instruments, bank loans and other payables.
The currency profile of these financial liabilities as at 31 March 2011 is shown below.
derivatives held at fair value through bank other profit or loss loans payables total 000 000 000 000 Hong Kong dollar 1,561 5,241 6,802 UK sterling 3,313 3,313 US dollar 21 62,013 2,756 64,790 1,582 62,013 11,310 74,905 Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities to meet funding commitments as necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing facilities are explained in Note 13 on page 45 to the financial statements.
Counterparty risk All securities and derivative instruments are transacted with brokers and carry the risk that the counterparty to a transaction may not meet its financial obligations.
All counterparties for any type of trading are assessed by the credit research and analysis function of the Managers.
Exposures to counterparties are monitored by the Manager.
Margin on exchange-traded derivatives mitigates counterparty risk exposure in accordance with the terms outlined in market standard ISDA derivative legal contracts.
Credit risk The Company may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All investment transactions are carried out with brokers that have been approved by the Managers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis.
Limits are established for each broker which are kept under review by the Managers.
Exposure to credit risk arises on cash and cash equivalents, outstanding investment transactions, equity linked notes and the derivative instruments.
Maturity analysis of contractual liabilities The financial liabilities of the Company are shown in notes 13 and 14 on page 45.
The major liabilities are the loan tranches which were both repayable on 9 April 2011.
Other liabilities comprise amounts due to brokers and accruals.
All are paid under contractual terms.
For amounts due to brokers, this is normally the purchase date plus three business days.
For accruals, this is normally within 30 business days of invoicing.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 18 to 20 of the Directors Report.
An increase of 10% in the fair value of the investments excluding derivatives at 31 March 2011 would have increased the profit after tax and total assets by 65,880,000.
A decrease of 10% in the fair value of investments would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Page 49 Notes to the Financial Statements Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis At 31 March 2011, if interest rates had increased by 0.5% the profit after taxation and total assets would have increased by 126,000.
If interest rates had decreased by 0.5% the profit after taxation and total assets would have decreased by 21,000.
The sensitivity is based on the Companys total cash balances held at 31 March 2011, with all other variables held constant.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis At 31 March 2011, if sterling had strengthened or weakened by 10% in relation to the other currency exposures, then with all other variables held constant, the profit after taxation and total assets would have been impacted by the amounts shown below.
If sterling had strengthened by 10%: 31.03.11 000 Chinese renminbi 48 Hong Kong dollar 47,183 Korean won 790 Japanese yen 1,486 Singapore dollar 681 Taiwan dollar 331 US dollar 11,267 61,786 If sterling had weakened by 10%: 31.03.11 000 Chinese renminbi 59 Hong Kong dollar 57,668 Korean won 966 Japanese yen 1,816 Singapore dollar 833 Taiwan dollar 405 US dollar 13,771 75,518 Derivative instruments exposure sensitivity analysis The Company invests in CFDs to gain exposure to the equity market.
A 10% fall in the price of shares underlying the CFDs at 31 March 2011 would have resulted in a decrease of 3,466,000 in the profit after taxation and total assets.
A rise of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Page 50 Fidelity China Special Situations PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
As explained in Note 2 i and j on page 38 investments are shown at fair value which is bid or last market price.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the US dollar denominated bank loans, whose fair value as at 31 March 2011, given below, has been calculated by discounting future cash flows at current US dollar interest rates.
31.03.11 31.03.11 fair value book value 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured bank loan @ 1.63% per annum 40,025 40,012 Fixed rate unsecured bank loan @ 1.88% per annum 22,009 22,001 62,034 62,013 Fair value hierarchy Under IFRS 7, the International Accounting Standards Board requires investment companies to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the Accounting Policies Notes 2 i and j on page 38.
