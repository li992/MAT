Share-based payments continued Share-based payment charges Share-based payment charges are calculated by spreading the fair value of an option over the vesting period having taken into account any performance conditions when estimating the number of options expected to vest.
The vesting period is typically three years from date of grant or the beginning of the bonus year in respect of grants under the MSEBP.
All options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model except grants under the LTIP and TIP which use the Monte Carlo option pricing model as they have market performance conditions which are included in the fair value calculation.
The following assumptions have been used in the option pricing models: Type of arrangement 2011 2010 2009 Risk-free interest rate % 0.6-1.99 0.6-2.2 0.5-5.0 Dividend yield % nil nil nil 1 Volatility of Misys plc ordinary shares % Share option schemes nil cost 32-47 41-57 39-65 Share option schemes market value 39-47 42-46 41-61 Savings-related share option schemes 44-46 45-46 38-46 Expected lives years of options granted under: Share option schemes nil cost 1-6.5 1.0-6.5 0.4-6.5 Share option schemes market value 6.5-6.5 3.0-6.5 3.0-6.5 Savings-related share option schemes 3.1-3.3 3.1-3.3 3.1-3.3 1 Expected volatility was calculated using the share price history for the period equivalent to the expected life.

This covers a numbers of countries where deferred tax assets are now considered likely to be utilised against future profits arising in the corresponding tax jurisdiction.
A number of changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are not therefore included in these financial statements.
The effect of the changes expected to be enacted in the Finance Act 2011 would be to reduce the deferred tax asset provided at the balance sheet date by 1.0m.
This 1.0m decrease in the deferred tax asset would decrease profit by 0.9m and decrease other comprehensive income by 0.1m.
This decrease in the deferred tax asset is due to the reduction in the corporation tax rate from 26 per cent to 25 per cent with effect from 1 April 2012.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 25% to 23%, if applied to the deferred tax balance at the balance sheet date, would be to further reduce the deferred tax asset by an additional 1.9m being 0.9m decrease in profit and 0.1m decrease in other comprehensive income in 2013 and a further 0.9m decrease in profit in 2014.

The recoverable amounts of the Banking, TCM and Misys Sophis CGUs were determined based on value-in-use calculations and no impairment was identied during the year.
Misys Sophis was acquired on 28 February 2011.
Management has reviewed post acquisition trading which was in line with expectation.
Where the recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations, these calculations use pre-tax cash ows for each CGU based on approved budgets and management forecasts which are consistent with the recent financial performance of the relevant CGU.
For Banking and TCM value-in-use calculations, it was not necessary to look at cash ows beyond five years as cash ows within this time horizon were signicantly in excess of the carrying amounts of the CGUs and hence no terminal value was assigned.
The value-in-use calculation for Misys Sophis includes long term cash ow growth of 2%.
Direct and indirect costs and corporate overheads have been calculated using the same percentage of revenue as for the recent budget and incorporates planned margin improvement.
Management determined budgeted operating margin based on past performance and its expectations of market development as outlined in the business review section.
Sensitivity analyses have been performed around the base case assumptions with the conclusion that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be less than the carrying amount.
For the value-in-use calculations, the first three years cash ows were based on budget and management forecasts and thereafter growth rates based on current and expected future performance as reected in the table below.
The following assumptions have been used in order to determine recoverable amounts based on value-in-use calculations: Growth rates Growth rates Pre-tax Pre-tax for cash ows for cash ows discount rate discount rate CGU years 1-3 years 4-5 2011 2010 Banking 8% 3% 10% 10% TCM 10% 9% 12% 12% Misys Sophis 15% 13% 13% 100 Annual Report 2011 Financial statements Misys Leading technology and innovation Acquisition of Sophis On 28 February 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Sophis for consideration of 235.5m.
As a result of this acquisition, the Group has established its position as the number one application software and services provider in capital markets as Misys Sophis buy-side solutions are complementary to the Groups sell-side strengths.
An analysis of the net assets acquired is shown below: Provisional Provisional fair value fair value at All gures in millions Book value adjustments 28 Feb 2011 Intangible assets 212.2 212.2 Property, plant and equipment 1.2 1.2 Deferred tax assets liabilities 8.0 26.5 18.5 Cash 18.0 18.0 Other assets 29.5 1.0 28.5 External debt 161.8 1.6 163.4 Other liabilities 10.7 3.4 14.1 Net assets acquired 115.8 179.7 63.9 Goodwill 171.6 Total consideration 235.5 An analysis of the enterprise value of Sophis is shown below: All gures in millions 2011 Consideration paid in cash 208.6 Consideration held in escrow 21.3 External debt net of cash acquired 145.4 Net cash outow on acquisition of subsidiaries 375.3 Equity consideration shares issued 5.6 Enterprise value of Sophis 380.9 The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Sophis is principally attributable to the anticipated profitability achieved through perceived cost and revenue synergies.
The fair value adjustments are based on an independent valuation at the time of acquisition and primarily relate to identied intangible assets technology, customer relationships and brand name and related deferred tax and other taxation.
Acquisition costs of 7.7m have been recognised as an exceptional expense in the current year.
Included in the profit for the year is an 8.6m loss attributable to the additional business generated by the Sophis Group.
Had this business combination been effected at 1 June 2010, the results of the combined Group from continuing operations would have been revenue of 417.3m, operating profit of 22.2m, adjusted operating profit of 84.4m and profit after tax of 11.0m.
The directors consider these pro-forma numbers to represent an approximate measure of the performance of the combined Group on an annualised basis and to provide a reference point for comparison in future periods.
In determining the pro-forma revenue and profit of the Group had Sophis been acquired at the beginning of the current reporting period, the directors have: s calculated depreciation of plant and equipment and intangibles acquired on the basis of the fair values arising in the initial accounting for the business combination rather than the carrying amounts recognised in the pre-acquisition financial statements: s calculated borrowing costs based on the funding levels, credit ratings and debt equity position of the Group after the business combination: and s calculated the effect of alignment of accounting policies from 1 June 2010.

Hedge accounting is not applied and the gains and losses are recorded in the income statement under finance income cost.
Embedded derivatives Certain long-term software licensing contracts are priced in currencies usually US dollars, sterling or euros other than those of the functional currencies of the customer and IPR holder entering into the contracts or the commonly used functional currency of that market.
Under IAS 39, such contracts may contain an embedded foreign currency derivative which must be extracted from the host contract and measured separately at each balance sheet date.
Gains or losses on these derivatives are charged or credited to the income statement in operating costs.
The contracts are generally of up to 10 years duration and this is therefore the period over which the assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet are expected to crystallise.

Financial instruments: risk management Misys operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks associated with the Groups activities under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the Group uses derivative financial instruments.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and species the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, instrument types, transaction limits and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash, short term deposits, bank loans, overdrafts, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investment in foreign operations.
Management has established a policy requiring Group companies to manage their foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Group companies are required to hedge on a monthly basis.
Group Treasury nets and consolidates the global prescribed hedges in the market with external forward contracts.
Additionally, Group Treasury reviews the actual non-sterling exposure cushion of the Group and hedges those exceeding the levels set by the Group foreign exchange policy with external forward contracts.
The Groups net exposure to foreign currency risk is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in note 37.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash ow interest rate risk on oating rate bank loans, overdrafts and cash held on deposit.
The Groups borrowings are primarily at variable interest rates set for periods of six months or less.
Based on the various scenarios, the Group manages its cash ow interest rate risk by using interest rate hedging instruments such as caps or swaps which are used to protect the Group against significant increases in interest rates.
Under the interest rate swap, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between the specified swap rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
The Groups cash balances are kept in interest bearing current accounts and on short-term deposit to maximise the level of return while maintaining an adequate level of liquidity.
The Group does not generally invest surplus funds in long-term xed interest securities and therefore its exposure to fair value interest rate risk is not generally significant.
The Groups net exposure to interest rate risk is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in note 37. Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions but primarily from outstanding trade receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has policies in place to ensure that sales are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative and cash transactions are limited to high-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
For customer contracts, the Group and each reporting subsidiary have specified risk control and authorisation procedures in place to assess the credit quality of a customer.
Where there is no independent risk rating for a customer, such an assessment takes into account financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk, with exposures spread over a large number of customers and counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within risk parameters set by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The long-term forecast cash and borrowings prole of the Group is monitored to ensure that adequate headroom remains under current and projected committed borrowing facilities.
