Intangible assets continued Acquired intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which are on average five years and the charge is included within administration expenses in the income statement.
Other intangible assets are in relation to licences and other agreements which are amortised over their useful lives or term, being three to five years, and are expensed within cost of sales or selling costs.
The remaining amortisation periods of the acquired intangible asset balances arising in relation to customer list and current technology are both 4.1 years.
Annual impairment test Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the Performance Analysis cash-generating unit at 30 November 2011, the annual impairment testing date, has been determined based on a value in use calculation using managements cash flow projections over a five year period.
The cash flows are derived from the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year, as approved by the Board, and the Groups three year strategic plan.
Cash flows for years four and five are then extrapolated based on long range plans.
The key factor in the cash flow forecasts is the ability to forecast revenue.
Cash flows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.75 per cent growth rate 2010 2.75 per cent which management estimates to be the approximate average long term growth rate for the industries in which this unit operates.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 14.9 per cent 2010 14.6 per cent.
The recoverable amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no impairment has been recognised.
Key assumptions for the annual impairment test The key assumptions used in the value in use calculation were: Revenue growth rates Gross margin Operating expenses Discount rate Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the five year period covered by managements projections Projections are denominated in the same currency as the denomination of the goodwill balance to eliminate the effect of fluctuating exchange rates.
Revenue growth rates used in managements projections are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served and take into account historic levels of growth, expected future developments in products and technology and macro-economic conditions.
The cash flows used in the impairment review have been approved by the Board.
Gross margins and operating expenses are based on historical values adjusted for the effect of revenue growth.
The discount rate applied to the cash flows is determined based on Spirents weighted average cost of capital by taking the risk free rate for ten year government bonds and making an adjustment to reflect both the increased risk of investing in equities and the systematic risk of the specific cash-generating unit.
In making this adjustment, inputs required are the equity market risk premium and the risk adjustment, beta, applied to reflect the risk of Spirent relative to the market as a whole.
