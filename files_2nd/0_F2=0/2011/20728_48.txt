Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
Before recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 000 2011 2010 Private equity asset management business - 297 - 297 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the next five years and extrapolates cash flows for the following five years based on an estimated growth rate of 5% 5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 15% post tax 15%.
Management have announced their intention to close the private equity asset management business as part of our strategy to focus on delivering investment performance from our quoted equity and fixed income portfolios.
Consequently the projected future cash flows were not sufficient to justify carrying forward any goodwill for this CGU and this was therefore fully amortised in the year.
