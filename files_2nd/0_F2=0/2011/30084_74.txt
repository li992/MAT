These expenses will only be utilised if the Group has profits chargeable to corporation tax in future accounting periods.
It is considered too uncertain that the Group will generate such profits and, on this basis, the deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
In respect of properties held in subsidiaries, provision for capital gains tax has been made for revaluation surpluses not sheltered by brought forward capital losses or non-trade debits.
TR Property Investment Trust 73 THE GROUP COMPANY Notes to the Financial Statements continued 8 Taxation continued On 23 March 2011 as part of the 2011 Budget, the UK Government announced its intention to legislate to reduce the rate of Corporation Tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011, which was subsequently enacted under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968.
The effect of this reduction is reflected in the unrecognised deferred tax assets disclosed in Note 8 b above.
