Cash-generating units are tested for impairment if there are indications of impairment at the balance sheet date.
Recoverable amounts for cash-generating units are mainly based on value in use, which is generally calculated from cash flow projections for five to 20 years using data from the Groups latest internal forecasts, the results of which are reviewed by the Board.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in margins.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the cash-generating units.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
The forecasts are extrapolated beyond five years based on estimated long-term growth rates of 2% to 5% 2010 1% to 4%.
The pre-tax discount rates used to calculate value in use range from 6% to 14% 2010 6% to 14% depending on the specific conditions in which each store operates.
These discount rates are derived from the Groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
