Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk sensitivity continued d Floating interest rate to fixed interest rate swap A decrease of 100 basis points on 30 year interest rates as at 31 December 2011 would have a direct effect on the fair value of the swap and net assets.
Based on the position as at 31 December 2011, over a full year, a decrease of 100 basis points would have decreased the gains on investments and net return on ordinary activities after taxation by 12,020,000 2010 9,617,000 and would have decreased the net asset value per share by 15.08p 2010 12.03p.
An increase of 100 basis points would have had an equal but opposite effect.
iii Foreign Currency Risk The Companys reporting currency is sterling, but investments are made in overseas markets as well as the United Kingdom and the asset value can be affected by movements in foreign currency exchange rates.
Furthermore many companies trade internationally both through foreign subsidiaries, and through exports.
The greatest foreign currency risk occurs when companies have a divergence in currencies for costs and revenues.
A much less risky exposure to currency is straight translation of sales and profits.
The List of Investments on pages 16 to 20 breaks down the portfolio by geographic listing.
However the location of the stock market quote only has a limited correlation to the costs, revenues and even activities of those companies, and so this note should not be regarded as a reliable guide to the sensitivity of the portfolio to currency movements.
For example, the holdings in the portfolio that have suffered most from US$ weakness are UK companies with dollar revenues and sterling costs.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
Overseas income is subject to currency fluctuations.
The Company does not hedge these currency fluctuations because it is impossible to quantify the effect for the reasons stated above.
However, from time to time the Manager takes a view by holding financial assets or liabilities in overseas currencies.
