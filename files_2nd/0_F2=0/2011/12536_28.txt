86 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Oil and gas assets continued b Development and production assets Development and production assets are accumulated generally on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets, as outlined in accounting policy a above.
The cost of development and production assets also includes the cost of acquisitions and purchases of such assets, directly attributable overheads, finance costs capitalised, and the cost of recognising provisions for future restoration and decommissioning.
Depreciation of producing assets The net book values of producing assets are depreciated generally on a field-by-field basis using the unit-of-production method by reference to the ratio of production in the year and the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
Producing assets are generally grouped with other assets that are dedicated to serving the same reserves for depreciation purposes, but are depreciated separately from producing assets that serve other reserves.
Pipelines are depreciated on a unit-of-throughput basis.
c Impairment of development and production assets An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances, arising during the development or production phase, indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the asset, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depreciation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since the impairment.
d Acquisitions, asset purchases and disposals Acquisitions of oil and gas properties are accounted for under the acquisition method when the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute a business.
Transactions involving the purchase of an individual field interest, or a group of field interests, that do not constitute a business, are treated as asset purchases irrespective of whether the specific transactions involve the transfer of the field interests directly or the transfer of an incorporated entity.
Accordingly, no goodwill and no deferred tax gross up arises, and the consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities purchased on an appropriate basis.
Proceeds on disposal are applied to the carrying amount of the specific intangible asset or development and production assets disposed of and any surplus is recorded as a gain on disposal in the income statement.
e Decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
The amount recognised is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related oil and gas property.
This is subsequently depreciated as part of the capital costs of the production facilities.
Any change in the present value of the estimated expenditure is dealt with prospectively as an adjustment to the provision and the oil and gas property.
The unwinding of the discount is included as a finance cost.
Inventories Inventories, except for petroleum products, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Petroleum products and under and overlifts of crude oil are recorded at net realisable value, under inventories and other debtors or creditors respectively.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 87 Tax The tax expense credit represents the sum of the tax currently payable recoverable and deferred tax movements during the year.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill excess of fair value over cost or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
The group reassesses its unrecognised deferred tax asset each year taking into account changes in oil and gas prices, the groups proven and probable reserve profile and forecast capital and operating expenditures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on tax laws and rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority and the group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Translation of foreign currencies In the accounts of individual companies, transactions denominated in foreign currencies, being currencies other than the functional currency, are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates as of the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rate subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets held at historic cost are translated at the date of purchase and are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are generally translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the year in which the operation is disposed of.
Group retirement benefits Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Payments made to statemanaged retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the groups obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, which requires contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is also recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of plan assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to unrecognised past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
88 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Royalties Royalties are charged as production costs to the income statement in the year in which the related production is recognised as income.
Leasing Rentals payable for assets under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the groups balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the year in which they arise.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly relating to the construction or production of a qualifying capital project under construction are capitalised and added to the project cost during construction until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use, i. e. when they are capable of commercial production.
Where the funds used to finance a project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings of the group during the period.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at their nominal value.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and oil price fluctuations.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost, including transaction costs.
Derivatives are subsequently carried at fair value.
Apart from those derivatives designated as qualifying cash flow hedging instruments, all changes in fair value are recorded as financial income or expense in the year in which they arise.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedging relationships may be of three types: fair value hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: cash flow hedges are hedges of particular risks that may change the amount or timing of future cash flows: and hedges of net investment in a foreign entity are hedges of particular risks that may change the carrying value of the net assets of a foreign entity.
Currently the group only has cash flow hedge relationships.
To qualify for hedge accounting the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditions on documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement.
If these conditions are not met, then the relationship does not qualify for hedge accounting.
In this case the hedging instrument and the hedged item are reported independently as if there were no hedging relationship.
In particular any derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value included in financial income or expense.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value.
The portion of any change in fair value that is an effective hedge is included in equity, and any remaining ineffective portion is reported in financial income.
If the hedging relationship is the hedge of a firm commitment or highly probable forecasted transaction, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset or liability at the time it is recognised.
For all other qualifying cash flow hedges, the cumulative changes of fair value of the hedging instrument that have been recorded in equity are included in financial income at the time when the forecasted transaction affects net income.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
Embedded derivatives which are closely related to host contracts, including in particular price caps and floors within the groups oil sales contracts, are not separated and are not carried at fair value.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 89 Derivative financial instruments continued Fair value is the amount for which a financial asset, liability or instrument could be exchanged between knowledgeable and willing parties in an arms length transaction.
It is determined by reference to quoted market prices adjusted for estimated transaction costs that would be incurred in an actual transaction, or by the use of established estimation techniques such as option pricing models and estimated discounted values of cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and short-term deposits, less overdrafts.
Cash equivalents comprise funds held in term deposit accounts with an original maturity not exceeding three months.
Share-based payments The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The main assumptions are provided in note 19.
Convertible bonds The net proceeds received from the issue of convertible bonds are split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, is included in equity and is not re-measured.
The liability component is carried at amortised cost.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component is charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate, at the time of issue, for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component of the instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible bonds.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty Details of the groups significant accounting judgements and critical accounting estimates are set out in these financial statements and include: carrying value of intangible exploration and evaluation assets note 8 : carrying value of property, plant and equipment note 9 : proved and probable reserves estimates note 9 : decommissioning costs note 16 : derivative financial instruments note 17 : tax and recognition of deferred tax assets note 18 : share-based payments note 19 : and pensions note 23.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the profit after tax and on the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year.
In May 2011, the company conducted a 4:1 share split.
In accordance with IAS 33 Earnings per Share the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Basic and diluted earnings per share are calculated as follows: Weighted average Profit after tax number of shares Earnings per share 2010 2010 2011 2010 2011 restated 2011 restated $ million $ million million million cents cents Basic 171.2 129.8 467.4 464.0 36.6 28.0 Contingently issuable shares 75.8 39.6 Diluted 171.2 129.8 543.2 503.6 31.5 25.8 The inclusion of the contingently issuable shares in the 2011 and 2010 calculations produces diluted earnings per share.
The contingently issuable shares include any expected additional share issues due to future share-based payments and for the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc, as detailed in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
At 31 December 2011 37,349,360 2010 restated: 37,349,360 potential Ordinary Shares in the company that are underlying the companys convertible bonds and that may dilute earnings per share in the future have not been included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share because they are anti-dilutive for the year 2010: anti-dilutive.
If the contingently issuable shares for the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc were excluded, diluted earnings per share would increase to 35.5 cents.

These amounts are written off to the income statement as exploration expense unless commercial reserves are established or the determination process is not completed and there are no indications of impairment.
The outcome of ongoing exploration, and therefore whether the carrying value of E&E assets will ultimately be recovered, is inherently uncertain.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 101 9.
Acquisitions in the current year relate to the purchase of the additional equity interest in the Wytch Farm field.
The group has assessed this transaction and concluded that it does not constitute a business under IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
Other fixed assets include items such as leasehold improvements, motor vehicles and office equipment.
Amortisation and depreciation of oil and gas properties is calculated on a unit-of-production basis, using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of proved and probable reserves on an entitlement basis at the end of the period plus production in the period, on a field-by-field basis.
Proved and probable reserve estimates are based on a number of underlying assumptions including oil and gas prices, future costs, oil and gas in place and reservoir performance, which are inherently uncertain.
Management uses established industry techniques to generate its estimates and regularly references its estimates against those of joint venture partners or external consultants.
However, the amount of reserves that will ultimately be recovered from any field cannot be known with certainty until the end of the fields life.
During the year, a net reversal of previous impairments of producing oil and gas properties was recognised.
The main elements were credits of US$33.5 million and US$6.5 million for reversal of previously recorded impairments in respect of the Scott and Chinguetti fields, offset by impairment charges of US$7.3 million and US$6.8 million in respect of the Balmoral and Brenda fields.
The reversals resulted from an increased estimate of the quantities of hydrocarbons recoverable from the Scott field coupled with a positive change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the impairment losses were recognised, most notably an increase in base price assumption for hydrocarbons due to the sustained high oil price environment.
The impairment charges arose mainly as a result of reduced estimates of the quantities of hydrocarbons recoverable from the Balmoral and Brenda fields.
102 Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 9.
Property, plant and equipment continued The impairment charges and reversals were calculated by comparing the future discounted cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves the value-in-use against the carrying value of the asset.
The future cash flows were estimated using an oil price assumption equal to the Dated Brent forward curve in 2012 and 2013 and US$75 bbl in real terms thereafter 2010: fixed price of US$75 bbl and were discounted using a discount rate of 10 per cent 2010: 10 per cent.
Assumptions involved in impairment measurement include estimates of commercial reserves and production volumes, future oil and gas prices and the level and timing of expenditures, all of which are inherently uncertain.
Investments Principal subsidiary undertakings At 31 December 2011, the company had investments in the following 100 per cent owned subsidiaries which principally affected the profits or net assets of the group.

Subsequent to year-end, the company completed the acquisition of EnCore Oil plc.
Further details are given in note 25 to the consolidated financial statements.
Joint ventures The group has a 49 per cent interest in Premco Energy Projects Company LLC, a company registered in the United Arab Emirates and a 50 per cent interest in Premco Energy Projects BV, a company registered in The Netherlands.
The results of these two jointly controlled entities, which are indirectly held through subsidiary undertakings and which are involved in business development opportunities across the Middle East and North Africa region, are accounted for using proportionate consolidation and were immaterial to the group in 2011 and 2010.

A maturity analysis showing the ageing profile of the total borrowings is shown in note 17.
During the year, the group undertook a private placement of senior loan notes of US$244.0 million and 75.0 million.
At the year-end date, the groups principal credit facilities comprised a US$175.0 million term loan and a NOK 150.0 million US$25.1 million exploration financing facility, both maturing in 2012, and a US$300.0 million term loan, a US$456.8 million revolving credit facility and a 394.7 million US$611.8 million letter of credit facility, all maturing in 2015.
Convertible bonds In June 2007, the group issued bonds at a par value of US$250.0 million which are convertible into Ordinary Shares of the company at any time from 6 August 2007 until six days before their maturity date of 27 June 2014.
At the initial conversion price of 15.82 per share there were 8,003,434 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
In April 2009, the conversion price was adjusted from 15.82 per share to 13.56 per share, as a result of the companys four for nine rights issue of new Ordinary Shares.
At the adjusted conversion price of 13.56 per share there were 9,337,340 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
In May 2011, the conversion price was adjusted from 13.56 per share, as a result of the companys 4:1 share split.
At the adjusted conversion price of 3.39 per share there are 37,349,360 Ordinary Shares of the company underlying the bonds.
If the bonds have not been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, they will be redeemed at par value on 27 June 2014.
Interest of 2.875 per cent per annum will be paid semi-annually in arrears up to that date.

Borrowings continued The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds were split between a liability element and an equity component at the date of issue.
The fair value of the liability component was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the convertible bonds and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the group, was included in equity reserves.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds based on their relative carrying amounts at the date of issue.
The portion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.
2011 2010 $ million $ million Liability component at 1 January 218.1 210.1 Interest charged 15.6 15.2 Interest paid 7.2 7.2 Total liability component at 31 December 226.5 218.1 The total interest charged for the year has been calculated by applying an effective annual interest rate of 6.73 per cent 2010: 6.73 per cent to the liability component for the period since the bonds were issued.
The non-cash accrual of interest will increase the liability component as the cash interest is only paid at 2.875 per cent to US$250.0 million at maturity.
There is no material difference between the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible bonds and its fair value.
This fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at the market rate.
Capital management The primary objective of the groups capital management policy is to ensure that it maintains healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and increase shareholder value.
The group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions.
No changes were made to the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
The group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by net assets plus net debt.
The groups policy is to keep the long-term gearing ratio below 50 per cent.
Net debt comprises interest-bearing bank loans, senior loan notes and convertible bonds, less cash and short-term deposits.

These provisions have been created based on the groups internal estimates and, where available, operators estimates.
Based on the current economic environment, assumptions have been made which the management believe are a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the future liability.
These estimates are reviewed regularly to take into account any material changes to the assumptions.
However, actual decommissioning costs will ultimately depend upon future market prices for the necessary decommissioning works required, which will reflect market conditions at the relevant time.
Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning is likely to depend on when the fields cease to produce at economically viable rates.
This in turn will depend upon future oil and gas prices, which are inherently uncertain.
New provisions and changes in estimates result from an increase in decommissioning estimates for non-operated fields in the UK and further provisions for fields in development in the UK, Indonesia and Vietnam, offset by an increase in the discount rate used to 5.20 per cent 2010: 3.25 per cent.
The change in discount rate used in 2011 increased the unwinding of discount charge by US$10.6 million.
Financial instruments Financial risk management objectives and policies The groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivative financial instruments derivatives, comprise accounts payable, bank loans, convertible bonds and senior loan notes.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage shortterm cash flow and to raise finance for the groups capital expenditure programme.
The group has various financial assets such as accounts receivable and cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
It is group policy that all transactions involving derivatives must be directly related to the underlying business of the group.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative exposures.
The main risks that could adversely affect the groups financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are commodity price risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain of these risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the groups policies and approved by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
Derivative financial instruments The group uses derivatives to manage its exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations and to changes in interest rates and foreign currency.
Oil and gas hedging is undertaken with collar options, reverse collars, swaps and hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements.
Oil is hedged using Dated Brent oil price options.
Indonesian gas is hedged using HSFO Singapore 180cst which is the variable component of the gas price.
The groups exposure to interest rates is managed by maintaining an appropriate mix of both fixed and floating interest rate borrowings within its debt portfolio.
However, given the very low level of fixed interest rates available relative to historical rates, substantially all of the current drawings have been converted to fixed interest rates using the interest rate swap markets.
As the group reports in US dollars, since that is the currency in which the majority of the groups transactions are denominated, significant exchange rate exposures currently relate only to certain local currency receipts and expenditures within individual business units.
Exchange rate exposures are managed within approved policy parameters utilising forward foreign exchange contracts.

Financial instruments continued Fair value hierarchy In line with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement the group uses the following hierarchy for determining the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 31 December 2011, the group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value excluding any primary financial instruments such as cash and bank loans : Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2011: Oil reverse collars 48.8 48.8 Gas forward sale contracts 0.3 0.3 Total 49.1 49.1 2010: Oil reverse collars 65.7 65.7 Total 65.7 65.7 Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss: At 31 December Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 $ million $ million $ million $ million 2011: Oil collars 100.8 100.8 Oil forward sale contracts 0.4 0.4 Gas collars 23.7 23.7 Interest rate swaps 19.3 19.3 Forward foreign exchange contracts 1.0 1.0 Cross currency swap 9.6 9.6 Total 154.8 154.8 2010: Oil collars 69.9 69.9 Oil forward sale contracts 4.2 4.2 Gas collars 21.5 21.5 Interest rate swaps 12.9 12.9 Forward foreign exchange contracts 0.6 0.6 Total 109.1 109.1 All of the above fair values are based on Level 2 techniques.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 107 17.
Financial instruments continued Commodity price risk Oil At 31 December 2011, the group had 1.8 million barrels of Dated Brent oil hedged with collars at an average floor price of US$40.0 bbl and an average cap of US$100.0 bbl, all of which are embedded through offtake agreements to the end of 2012.
The group also has oil collars with banks which are marked to market through profit or loss.
Additionally, the group has executed reverse collars with certain oil trading companies at strike prices identical to the bank collars.
Similar to the bank collars, these reverse collars are derivatives that must be marked to market through profit or loss.
They effectively offset each other, resulting in no net impact on the income statement or balance sheet.
The hedges embedded in long-term crude offtake agreements are not fair valued as they qualify for own-use exemption under IAS 39.
In addition, 2.1 million barrels of Dated Brent oil were hedged through forward sales for 2012 at an average price of US$105.3 bbl.
During the year, embedded oil price collars for 3.24 million barrels matured generating a net cost of US$101.3 million 2010: US$8.0 million.
This cost has been offset against sales revenues.
Indonesian gas At the year-end date, 162,000 metric tonnes mt of Singapore 180 HSFO, which underlies the pricing mechanism for Indonesian gas sold into the Singapore market, was subject to collars covering the period to mid-year 2013, with a floor of US$250.0 mt and a cap of US$500.0 mt.
An additional 132,000 mt have been sold under monthly forward sales contracts for 2012 at an average price of US$622.0 mt.
During the year, Singapore 180 HSFO contracts for 120,000 mt matured generating a cash cost of US$17.8 million 2010: US$0.1 million which have been offset against sales revenues.
All of these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
In the current year, US$6.0 million of the movement in the fair value of these contracts was credited to the income statement 2010: credit of US$20.4 million, as this movement related to the time-value portion of hedges under IAS 39.
The remaining movement, being a charge of US$6.3 million 2010: charge of US$12.0 million, related to the intrinsic value of such instruments and was recognised directly in retained earnings.

Financial instruments continued Commodity contract sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of net income and equity to a 10 per cent increase and a 10 per cent decrease in this variable: Oil Gas Total Increase decrease in mark to market value $ million $ million $ million Ten per cent increase 22.1 8.6 30.7 Ten per cent decrease 18.7 8.0 26.7 Deferred revenue related to oil reverse collars Deferred revenue has been created due to first-day gains arising from offtake agreements and related oil reverse collars.
This deferred revenue is being released to the income statement over the life of each individual offtake agreement as shown below: Oil Gas Total Asset liability $ million $ million $ million At 1 January 2010 54.1 54.1 Credit to income statement for the year 18.2 18.2 At 31 December 2010 35.9 35.9 Credit to income statement for the year 27.5 27.5 At 31 December 2011 8.4 8.4 Interest rate risk At 31 December 2011, US$450.0 million of the groups long-term bank borrowings have been swapped from floating rate to fixed rate.
Under these interest rate swap contracts, the group has agreed to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates and the cash flow exposure on the issued variable rate debt held.
These contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges and were assessed to be effective.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the forward curves at this date.
The movement in fair values is shown in the table below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2010 0.8 Cash settlement for swaps 7.0 Charge to income statement for the year 7.0 Charge to retained earnings for the year 12.1 At 31 December 2010 12.9 Cash settlement for swaps 8.9 Charge to income statement for the year 8.9 Charge to retained earnings for the year 6.4 At 31 December 2011 19.3 Interest rate swaps sensitivity analysis The key variable which affects the fair value of the groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future interest rates.
The following illustrates the sensitivity of comprehensive income to an increase of 50 basis points in this variable: Total Increase decrease in mark to market value $ million Increase of fifty basis points 4.4 A decrease of 50 basis points in this variable has not been considered appropriate due to the current very low level of floating interest rates.
Premier Oil plc 2011 Annual Report and Financial Statements 109 17.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency exchange risk During the year, the group issued 75.0 million long-term senior loan notes which have been hedged under a cross currency swap in US dollars at a fixed rate of US$1.423:.
The fair value of this cross currency swap at the reporting date is shown below: Total Asset liability $ million At 1 January 2011 Charge to income statement for the year 9.5 Charge to retained earnings for the year 0.1 At 31 December 2011 9.6 To cover sterling exposures an amount of 182.0 million was purchased with forward contracts during the year 2010: 198.0 million.
Premiers activities are largely conducted in US dollars.
The majority of borrowings at year-end were denominated in US dollars to match the currency of the assets.
The impact of variations in foreign exchange rates on the groups results would be immaterial.
Other financial instruments Credit risk The groups credit risk is attributable to its trade receivables and its bank deposits.
The amount of receivables presented in the balance sheet is net of allowances for doubtful receivables, which were immaterial in 2011 and 2010.
The group does not require collateral or other security to support receivables from customers or related parties.
