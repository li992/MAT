Share based payments The total charge for the year in respect of share based remuneration schemes was 3.5m 2010: 3.4m.
In addition, as the Company has issued options over its own shares to employees of its subsidiary companies, the Company has to increase the cost of its investment in the relevant subsidiary by the fair value of the options granted.
The key elements of each scheme along with the assumptions employed to arrive at the charge in the profit and loss account are set out below.
Where appropriate the expected volatility has been based on historic volatility considering daily share price movements over periods equal to the expected future life of the awards and the risk free rate is based on the Bank of Englands projected nominal yield curve with appropriate duration.
Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme SAYE The SAYE scheme, established in 1983, grants options annually in September to employees of the Group at a fixed exercise price, being the market price of the Companys shares at the grant date discounted by up to 20%.
Employees then enter into a savings contract over three years and, subject to continued employment, purchase options at the end of the period based on the amount saved.
Options are then exercisable for a six month period following completion of the savings contract.
As the option is equity settled, under FRS 20 charges are only made in respect of options granted after 7 November 2002.
For options granted in the year, the fair value per option granted and the assumptions used in the calculation of the value are as follows: Grant date 2011 2010 Share price at grant date 1789p 1431p Exercise price 1432p 1144p Number of employees 436 370 Shares under option 88,371 94,501 Vesting period 3 years 3 years Expected volatility 35% 35% Option life 6 months 6 months Expected life Risk free rate 0.8% 1.3% Dividend yield 2.8% 1.7% Possibility of forfeiture 7.5% p. a.
