The fair value of the Groups investment and development properties as at 31 December 2011 was determined by independent external valuers Jones Lang LaSalle for Earls Court & Olympia excluding Empress State, and CB Richard Ellis for the remainder of the Groups investment and development property.
The valuation conforms with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors RICS Valuation Standards, and was arrived at by reference to market transactions for similar properties.
Fees paid to valuers are based on fixed price contracts.
The main assumptions underlying the valuations are in relation to market rent or business profitability, taking into account forecast growth rates and yields based on known transactions for similar properties and likely incentives offered to tenants.
Valuations are based on what is determined to be the highest and best use.
The Groups investment at Earls Court, and Seagrave Road, a car park supporting Earls Court, have been valued as a site with development potential.
There are certain restrictions on the realisability of investment property when a credit facility is in place.

Certain leases provide for payment of contingent rent, usually a proportion of net rental income, in addition to the rents above.
Finance lease liabilities are effectively secured obligations, as the rights to the leased asset revert to the lessor in the event of default.
27 OPERATING LEASES The Group earns rental income by leasing its investment properties to tenants under operating leases.
In the United Kingdom standard commercial leases vary considerably between markets and locations but typically are for a term of five to 15 years at market rent with provisions to review to market rent every five years.

The majority of the Groups financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policies for managing each of these risks and the principal effects of these policies on the results for the year are summarised below.
Market risk a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises both cash flow and fair value risks.
Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
Fair value risk is the risk that the fair value of financial instruments will fluctuate as a result of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk, whereas borrowings issued at fixed interest rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Bank debt is typically at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
It is Group policy, and often a requirement of our lenders, to eliminate substantially all short and medium-term exposure to interest rate fluctuations in order to establish certainty over medium-term cash flows by using floating to fixed interest rate swaps.
Swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating to fixed rates.
Interest rate collars protect the Group by capping the maximum interest rate paid at the collars ceiling but sacrifices the profitability of interest rate falls below a certain floor.
Interest rate swaptions provide the Group with the right but not the obligation to enter into an interest rate swap on a specific future date at a set rate.
As a consequence, the Group is exposed to market price risk in respect of the fair value of its fixed rate derivative financial instruments, as discussed in the financial review on pages 38 to 43.
The table below shows the effects of derivative contracts that are linked to the borrowings profile of the Group: Fixed Floating Fixed Floating 2011 2011 2010 2010 m m m m Borrowings 8.9 544.4 6.8 657.8 Derivative impact nominal value of derivative contracts 515.1 515.1 624.7 624.7 Borrowings profile net of derivative impact 524.0 29.3 631.5 33.1 Interest rate protection 94.6% 95.0% Group policy is to ensure that interest rate protection is within the range of 75 per cent to 100 per cent.
The weighted average rate of interest rate swaps currently effective is 4.5 per cent 2010 4.8 per cent.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift upwards in the level of interest rates would have a positive impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the income statement of 10.0 million 2010 9.8 million.
The approximate impact of a 50 basis point shift downwards in the level of interest rates would have a negative impact on the movement in fair value of derivative financial instruments recognised in the income statement of 10.0 million 2010 9.8 million.
In practice, a parallel shift in the yield curve is highly unlikely.
However, the sensitivity analysis above is a reasonable illustration of the possible effect from the changes in slope and shifts in the yield curve that may actually occur and represents managements assessment of possible changes in interest rates.
Because the fixed rate derivative financial instruments are matched by short-term floating rate debt, the overall effect on Group cash flow of such a movement would be very small.
b Foreign exchange risk The Groups largest exposure to foreign exchange movements is in respect of its investments in the Chinese investment fund which is denominated in US dollars.
The Groups policy is generally not to hedge foreign currency exposures that are less than 15 per cent of its net assets.
Foreign currency exposures in excess of this amount, as far as practicable, will be hedged by borrowing in foreign currencies and through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent strengthening of sterling against the US dollar would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by 1.8 million 2010 6.0 million.
The approximate impact of a 10 per cent weakening of sterling against the US dollar would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by 2.0 million 2010 6.6 million.
This represents managements assessment of possible changes in exchange rates.
com 97 o ur financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED c Market price risk The financial results are subject to movements in the value of underlying investment properties, interest rates and economic sentiment.
A one percent increase in the valuation of investment and development property would increase the valuation of investment and development property in the income statement by 16.2 million.
A one per cent decrease in the valuation of investment and development property would decrease the gain on revaluation of investment and development property in the income statement by 16.2 million.
For further information on covenant positions on investment and development property refer to page 118.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is managed to ensure that the Group is able to meet future payment obligations when financial liabilities fall due.
Liquidity analysis is intended to provide sufficient headroom to meet the Groups operational requirements and investment commitments.
The Groups treasury policy also includes maintaining adequate cash, as well as maintaining adequate committed facilities.
A key factor in ensuring existing facilities remain available to the Group is the borrowing entities ability to meet the relevant facilities financial covenants.
The Group has a process to monitor regularly both current and projected compliance with the financial covenants.
A detailed analysis of the Groups financial covenant position is set out on page 118.
The Groups policy is to seek to minimise its exposure to liquidity risk by managing its exposure to interest rate risk and to refinancing risk.
The Group seeks to borrow for as long as possible at the lowest acceptable cost.
The Group regularly reviews the maturity profile of its financial liabilities and will seek to avoid concentrations of maturities through the regular replacement of facilities and by staggering maturity dates.
Refinancing risk may be reduced by reborrowing prior to the contracted maturity date, effectively switching liquidity risk for market risk.
This is subject to credit facilities being available at the time of the desired refinancing.
The tables below set out the maturity analysis of the Groups financial liabilities based on the undiscounted contractual obligations to make payments of interest and to repay principal.
Where interest payment obligations are based on a floating rate the rates used are those implied by the par yield curve.

98 understanding our business our business performance How we govern our business our financial statements 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a tenant or counterparty fails to meet an obligation under a contract.
Credit risk arises primarily from trade receivables relating to tenants but also from the Groups undrawn commitments and holdings of assets such as cash deposits and loans with financial counterparties.
Credit risk associated with trade receivables is actively managed: tenants are managed individually by asset managers, who continuously monitor and work with tenants, anticipating and wherever possible identifying and addressing risks prior to default.
Prospective tenants are assessed through an internally conducted review process, including obtaining credit ratings and reviewing financial information.
As a result deposits or guarantees may be obtained.
The amount of deposits held as collateral at 31 December 2011 is 2.0 million 2010 1.7 million.
In relation to the Groups exhibition income, receivables greater than 90 days are fully provided against.
Additionally, specific provisions are made for trade receivables less than 90 days where active credit control highlights recoverability issues.
Due to the nature of tenants being managed individually by asset managers, it is the Groups policy to calculate any impairment specifically on each contract.
The amounts of trade receivables presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables, past due but not impaired, is as follows: Group Group 2011 2010 m m Up to three months 15.5 9.8 Over three months 0.4 Trade receivables 15.5 10.2 Also included within receivables are 3.4 million 2010 6.3 million of loan notes.
All loan notes have been reviewed for potential impairment and are considered to be receivable as at the year end.
In 2011 trade receivables impaired amounted to 0.3 million 2010 0.4 million, this is considered to be an immaterial amount and within budgeted levels given current economic conditions.
The credit risk relating to cash, deposits and derivative financial instruments is actively managed by Group Treasury.

The Group uses a mix of equity, debt and financial instruments and aims to access both debt and equity capital markets with maximum efficiency and flexibility.
The key ratios used to monitor the capital structure of the Group are the debt to assets ratio and the interest coverage ratio.
The Group aims not to exceed an underlying debt to asset ratio of more than 45 per cent and to maintain interest cover above 125 per cent.
These are discussed in the financial review on pages 38 to 43.

com 101 o ur financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 28 FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Fair value estimation The table below analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by valuation method.
The different levels are defined as follows: Level 1: valuation based on quoted market prices traded in active markets.
Level 2: valuation based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that maximise the use of observable data either directly from market prices or indirectly derived from market prices.
Level 3: where one or more inputs to valuation are not based on observable market data.
Valuations at this level are more subjective and therefore more closely managed, including sensitivity analysis of inputs to valuation models.
Such testing has not indicated that any material difference would arise due to a change in input variables.

All of the Groups Level 3 financial instruments are unlisted equity investments.
These investments are externally valued quarterly, with valuations performed by examining expected yields of the underlying property and expectations relating to the property market and wider economic factors.
102 understanding our business our business performance How we govern our business our financial statements 29 DEFERRED TAX PROVISION Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, provision is made for the deferred tax assets and liabilities associated with the revaluation of investment properties at the corporate tax rate expected to apply to the Group at the time of use.
For United Kingdom properties the relevant tax rate will be 25 per cent 2010 27 per cent.
The movements in the year in deferred tax both recognised and unrecognised mainly reflect the tax effect of property revaluation gains arising in the year as well as availability of Group losses previously not recognised.
The recognised deferred tax liability on investment properties calculated under IAS 12 was 14.1 million at 31 December 2011 2010 nil.
The IAS 12 calculation does not necessarily reflect the expected amount of tax that would be payable if the assets were sold.
The Group estimates that calculated on a disposal basis, by reference to the properties original historic tax base costs, the tax liability on a sale at 31 December 2011 would be nil 2010 10.4 million.
This is due to a number of factors including the availability of losses and indexation relief, the Group holding structure for certain properties and the application of the REIT provisions to disposals within 2 years of the demerger date May 2010.
The tax basis of properties formerly within the REIT regime will be revised in May 2012 the second anniversary of the demerger from their original historic tax base cost to the value at the time of exit.
If this latter tax basis had applied at 31 December 2011, the tax liability on a disposal basis would again have been nil.

com 107 o ur financial statements NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 38 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED Share Option Scheme Market value options to subscribe for ordinary shares may be awarded under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Performance Share Plan.
Exercise is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions determined by the Remuneration Committee at the time of grant.
For awards made in 2010 and 2011, awards are subject to performance conditions relating to: a the Companys total return TR over three consecutive financial years the TR Performance Period relative to the median of the TRs over the equivalent period of Capital Shopping Centres Group PLC, Land Securities Group PLC, British Land Company plc, Hammerson plc, Segro plc, Derwent London plc, Great Portland Estates plc and Shaftesbury plc the Comparator Group : and b the Companys total shareholder return TSR over a period of three years the TSR Performance Period relative to the median of the TSRs over the same period of the Comparator Group.
One half of each award will be subject to the TR performance condition and the other half to the TSR performance condition.
TR is the growth in the adjusted, diluted net asset value per ordinary share plus dividends per ordinary share paid during the TR performance period.
In calculating TR for a company which is not a REIT, any provision for contingent capital gains tax will be added back.
For full vesting to be achieved, the target is median 2.5 per cent per annum.
TSR is the increase in the price of an ordinary share plus the value of any dividends paid during the TSR performance period re-invested in ordinary shares.
For full vesting to be achieved, the target is median 4 per cent per annum.
For performance at median, 33 per cent of an award will vest.
For intermediate performance above median, vesting will be on a straight-line basis from 33 per cent to 100 per cent.
In order for any awards to vest, the Committee must satisfy itself that TR and TSR performance figures are a genuine reflection of underlying financial performance.
Where events occur which cause the Committee to consider that the performance conditions have become inappropriate or impractical, the Committee may amend, relax or waive such conditions as it deems appropriate, provided that the conditions after the changes are not materially tougher or easier to achieve than was intended at the outset.
During any performance period, the Committee may, at its discretion, remove from the Comparator Group a company which has ceased to be quoted or to exist or the relevance of which as a comparator has, in the opinion of the Committee, significantly diminished.
The Committee may also, at its discretion, add to the Comparator Group whether to replace a removed member or otherwise if it believes that such addition will enhance the relevance of the Comparator Group.
The options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
In general options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
A schedule to the PSP was approved by HMRC as a CSOP scheme on 15 March 2011, therefore the company now makes a proportion of awards as approved options.
Share options outstanding at 31 December 2011 were exercisable between 103.87 pence and 176.33 pence and have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 9.2 years.
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of share options for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 1.7 million 2010 0.5 million.

Matching Share Plan Under the Capital & Counties Properties PLC Matching Share Plan, deferred shares may be awarded as part of any bonus.
Awards may also be made as nil cost options.
The release of deferred share awards is not dependent on the achievement of any further performance conditions other than that participants remain employed by the Group for a specified time, typically three years, from the date of the award.
Awards of nil cost options were made in 2011.
The fair value of share awards will be determined by the market price of the shares at the grant date.

The matching share award comprises the same number of shares as are purchased or deferred except in certain circumstances where the matching awards may comprise or be increased to 200 per cent of the number of shares purchased or deferred.
Vesting of matching shares and matching nil cost options is subject to appropriately challenging performance conditions.
Vesting of matching shares will occur on the later of the third anniversary of grant and the date on which the performance outcome is finally determined.
The matching nil cost options have a vesting period of three years and a maximum contractual life of ten years.
The performance conditions that apply to the awards of matching shares made in 2011 are the same as those that apply to the awards of options made under the Performance Share Plan during 2010 and 2011.
Matching shares and matching nil cost options generally lapse if the Director leaves the Company or sells any of the related purchased or deferred shares.
