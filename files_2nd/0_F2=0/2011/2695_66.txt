Capital management The Group defines capital as net debt and shareholders equity.
It does not have any externally imposed requirements for managing capital, other than those imposed by company law.
The Group manages its capital to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to achieve its strategic objectives and to minimise cost of finance, taking into account: a the liquidity required in light of the projected funding requirements of the Groups operating businesses with an appropriate level ofcontingency: b the level of financial strength required to maintain the Groups terms of trade taking account of its operational cash generation: c the relative post-tax cost of debt and equity: and d the extent to which external debt finance is, or is likely to be, available to the Group on acceptable terms.
In order to maintain or adjust capital structure, the Group may vary the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, issue new shares, return capital to shareholders, or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Articles of Association of the Company permit borrowing up to three times the adjusted capital and reserves of the Group.
Further, relationships are maintained with a selected group of major international banks to ensure appropriate funding capacity is available.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders.
This process is managed through the Groups budget and longer-term forecasting process.
The Group is required to maintain a net debt to EBITDA ratio not exceeding 2:1, EBITDA to interest cover of at least 5:1 and to exceed specified minimum trading cash flow limits, in any given period under its revolving credit facilities.
