Notes to the parent company financial statements 1 PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Convention The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
As permitted by s. 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no profit and loss account is presented for Reckitt Benckiser Group plc.
Foreign Currency Translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of foreign currency transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except where hedge accounting is applied.
Taxation The tax charge credit is based on the result for the period and takes into account taxation deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided for in full and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are considered recoverable.
A net deferred tax asset is considered recoverable if it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Fixed Assets Fixed asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and their recoverable amount, which is determined as the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
A review for the potential impairment of an investment is carried out by the Directors if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investment may not be recoverable.
Such impairment reviews are performed in accordance with FRS 11, Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Employee Share Schemes Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and restricted share schemes.
Any shortfall between the cost to the employee and the fair market value of the awards at date of grant is charged to the income statement over the period to which the performance criteria relate, with the credit taken directly to the profit and loss account.
Additional employer costs in respect of options and awards are charged to the income statement account over the same period with the credit included in equity.
Where awards are contingent upon future events an assessment of the likelihood of these conditions being achieved is made at the end of each reporting period and reflected in the accounting entries made.
Where the Company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of the Group, and such share based compensation is accounted for as equitysettled in the consolidated financial statements of the Group, FRS 20 Share Based Payments requires the subsidiaries to record an expense for such compensation, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Debtors Debtors are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Share Capital Transactions When the Company repurchases equity share capital, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a charge to equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury in order to satisfy employee options, or cancelled and, in order to maintain capital, an equivalent amount to the nominal value of the shares cancelled is transferred from the profit and loss account to the capital redemption reserve.
Cash Flow Statement Reckitt Benckiser Group plc has presented a Group cash flow statement in its Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011, therefore as permitted by FRS 1 revised 1996, Cash Flow Statements, the Directors have not prepared a cash flow statement for the Company.
