i Estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Significant items subject to such assumptions and estimates include the fair value of investment properties, the measurement and recognition of provisions, the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for potential corporation tax, amortisation of intangible assets and the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
The most critical accounting polices in determining the financial condition and results of the Group are those requiring the greatest degree of subjective or complex judgements.
These relate to property valuation, business combinations and goodwill, intangible assets, investment in associates, derivative financial instruments, provisions and taxation and these are discussed in the policies below.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
Iftherevisionaffects both current and future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.

The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner or realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which theasset can beutilised.

l Segmental reporting An operating segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that engages in business activities, earns revenue and incurs expenses, whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the Groups chief operating decision-makers and for which discrete financial information isavailable.
The Group has one business activity, being property investment and development and operates in the United Kingdom.
The Groups investment properties are managed as a single portfolio by an asset management team whose responsibilities are not segregated by asset type or location, but on an asset by asset basis.
The Board receives financial information for the portfolio as a whole and not as separate businesses or divisions.
The Directors have considered the nature of the business, how the business is managed and how they review performance and, in their judgement believe that the Group has only one reportable business segment.
m Capital management policy The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return tostakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
In managing its capital, the Groups primary objective is to ensure its continued ability to provide a consistent return for its equity shareholders through a combination of capital growth and distributions.
In order to achieve this objective, the Group seeks to maintain a gearing ratio thatbalances risks and returns at an acceptable level and also maintain a sufficient funding base to enable the Group to meet its working capital and strategic investment needs.
In making decisions to adjust its capital structure to achieve these aims, either through altering its dividend policy, new share issues, or the reduction of debt, the Group considers not only its short-term position but also its long-term operational and strategic objectives.

b Financial risk management Financial risk factors The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potentialadverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain riskexposures.
The Groups operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The exposure to each risk, how it arises and the policy formanaging each risk is summarised below: i Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a client or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash balances and deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its cash deposits and trade receivables, the balance of which represents the Groups maximum exposure tocredit risk.
The trade receivable amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and therefore the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Cash is placed on deposit with a number of different reputable banks with strong credit ratings and for varying periods of time, therebyspreading risk.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited due to the Groups policy of monitoring counterparty exposures with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of these instruments.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, withexposure spread over a large number of counterparties.
ii Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of working capital and the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
It is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Group actively maintains a mixture of long-term and short-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and committed investments.
The Groups undrawn committed borrowing facilities are monitored against projected cash flows.
The Group prepares annual budgets and working capital forecasts to assess future cash requirements.
The Group had no available and undrawn bank loan facilities at 31 March 2011 2010: 150 million.
iii Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rate fluctuations.
Financial statements Governance Operating and financial review Overview London & Stamford Property Plc 46 Report and Accounts 2011 Notes forming part of the Group financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2011 15 Borrowings and financial instruments continued iv Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk from long-term borrowings at a variable rate.
It is Group policy that a reasonable portion ofexternal borrowings are at a fixed interest rate.
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate exposure and hedge future interest rate risk for the term of the bank loan.
Although the Board accepts that this policy neither protects the Group entirely from the risk of paying rates in excess of current market rates noreliminates fully the cash flow risk associated with interest payments, it considers that it achieves an appropriate balance of exposure totheserisks.
At 31 March 2011 the Group had 351 million of hedges in place, and its debt was 91% fixed.
Consequently, based on year end debt levels, a 1% change in interest rates would increase or decrease the Groups annual profit before tax by 1.0 million and 1.3 million respectively.
The average interest rate payable by the Group on all bank borrowings at 31 March 2011 net of undrawn facility commitment fees was 4.08% 31March 2010: 5.83%.
v Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not theGroups functional currency.
The Group has not entered into any foreign currency transactions.
vi Capital risk management The Group defines its equity as share capital, other reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups objectives when maintaining capitalare tosafeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern so that it can provide returns to shareholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and other financial assets, and equity comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment ofdividends, new share issues as well as the issue of new debt or the redemption of existing debt.

The market values of hedging products change with interest rate fluctuations, but the exposure of the Group to movements in interest rates isprotected by way of the hedging products listed above.
In accordance with accounting standards, fair value is calculated on areplacement basis using mid-market rates.
For all derivative financial instruments this equates to a Level 2 fair value measurement asdefined by IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Thevaluation therefore does not reflect the cost or gain to the Group of cancelling its interest rate protection at the balance sheet date, whichisgenerally a marginally higher cost or smaller gain than a market valuation.
