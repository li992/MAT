Financial statements Notes to the accounts 1 Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and interpretations adopted by the European Union.
During 2011, the following pronouncements either had no impact on the financial statements or resulted in changes to presentation and disclosure only: Revised IAS 24 Related Party disclosures: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010 Amendments to IFRS 1 Limited Exemption from Comparative IFRS 7 Disclosures: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010 At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards and guidance relevant to the Group were in issue but not yet effective: Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures: effective for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013 Amendments to IAS 12 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012 Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of items of other comprehensive income: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 July 2012 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair value measurement: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements: effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 These pronouncements, when applied, will either result in changes to presentation and disclosure, or are not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis as explained in the Directors Report on page 65.
The financial statements are presented in sterling.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that investment and development properties, owner-occupied properties, other investments and derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period.
If the revision affects both current and future periods, the change is recognised over those periods.
Significant judgements and key estimates The preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that may affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Property valuations The property portfolio, which is carried in the balance sheet at fair value, is valued six-monthly by professionally qualified external valuers and the Directors must ensure that they are satisfied that the valuation of the Groups properties is appropriate for the accounts.
The independent valuations are based on a number of assumptions such as appropriate discount rates and estimates of future rental income and capital expenditure.
Property valuations are one of the principal uncertainties of the Group, as noted on page 24.
76 Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 Overview Business & financial review Governance Financial statements Property portfolio Other information Financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued Other investments The Company holds other investments which are classified as available for sale and held at fair value on the balance sheet.
The fair value of these investments is based on the Directors valuation, having regard to external valuations of the underlying properties and the Groups interest in these properties.
Accounting for acquisitions Management must assess whether the acquisition of property through the purchase of a corporate vehicle should be accounted for as an asset purchase or a business combination.
As noted in the accounting policy below, where the acquired company contains significant assets or liabilities in addition to property, the transaction is accounted for as a business combination.
Where there are no such items, the transaction is treated as an asset purchase.
Accounting for joint ventures The accounting treatment for our joint ventures requires an assessment to determine the degree of control or influence which the Group may exercise over them and the form of any control.
Hammersons interest in its joint ventures is commonly driven by the terms of partnership agreements which ensure that control is shared between the partners.
As a result, these are accounted for as jointly controlled entities and are included in the financial statements on a proportionate consolidation basis in accordance with IAS 31.
REIT and SIIC status The Company has elected for UK REIT and French SIIC status.
To continue to benefit from these tax regimes, the Group is required to comply with certain conditions as outlined in notes 8E and 8F to the accounts.
Management intends that the Group should continue as a UK REIT and French SIIC for the foreseeable future.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control is assumed when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity, or business, to benefit from its activities.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where properties are acquired through corporate acquisitions but there are no significant assets or liabilities other than property, the acquisition is treated as an asset acquisition.
In other cases, particularly where there is an integrated set of activities and assets, capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return, the business combination approach method is used.
Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups proportionate share of assets, liabilities, results and cash flows of joint ventures.
Associates Associates are those entities over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are accounted for using the equity method.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted for post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the acquired entity over the Groups interest in the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Where the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired is greater than the cost, the excess, known as negative goodwill, is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at exchange rates approximating to the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date and, unless they relate to the hedging of the net investment in foreign operations, differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 77 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The operating income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at the average exchange rates for the year.
Significant transactions, such as property sales, are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of each transaction.
The principal exchange rate used to translate foreign currency-denominated amounts in the balance sheet is the rate at the end of the year, 1 1.197 2010: 1 1.167.
The principal exchange rate used for the income statement is the average rate, 1 1.153 2010: 1 1.166.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal of the foreign operation.
Borrowings, interest and derivatives Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, after taking account of any discount on issue and attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, borrowings are held at amortised cost, such that discounts and costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the borrowing at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to economically hedge its exposure to foreign currency movements and interest rate risks.
Hedge accounting is applied in respect of net investments in foreign operations.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value, which equates to cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value, with changes in fair value being included in the income statement, except that a gain or loss on the portion of an instrument that is an effective hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation is recognised in the hedging reserve.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially measured at fair value, subsequently measured at amortised cost and, where the effect is material, discounted to reflect the time value of money.
Net finance costs Net finance costs include interest payable on borrowings, net of interest capitalised, interest receivable on funds invested, and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Capitalisation of interest Interest is capitalised if it is directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of development properties or the redevelopment of investment properties.
Capitalisation commences when the activities to develop the property start and continues until the property is substantially ready for its intended use.
Capitalised interest is calculated with reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, for that part of the development cost financed out of general funds, to the average rate.
Property portfolio Investment properties Investment properties are stated at fair value, being market value determined by professionally qualified external valuers, and changes in fair value are included in the income statement.
Development properties Properties acquired with the intention of redevelopment are classified as development properties and stated at fair value, being market value determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Changes in fair value are included in the income statement.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a development property are capitalised.
When development properties are completed, they are reclassified as investment properties.
78 Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 Overview Business & financial review Governance Financial statements Property portfolio Other information Financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued Leasehold properties Leasehold properties that are leased out to tenants under operating leases are classified as investment properties or development properties, as appropriate, and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the freeholder or superior leaseholder for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception.
Payments to the freeholder or superior leaseholder are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding liability.
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Contingent rents payable, such as rent reviews or those related to rental income, are charged as an expense in the periods in which they are incurred.
Depreciation In accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment and development properties, which are carried at fair value.
Leasehold property occupied by the Group owner-occupied property is depreciated where material over its expected useful life, giving due consideration to its estimated residual value.
Net rental income Rental income from investment property leased out under an operating lease is recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Contingent rents, such as turnover rents, rent reviews and indexation, are recorded as income in the periods in which they are earned.
Rent reviews are recognised when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Lease incentives and costs associated with entering into tenant leases are amortised over the period to the first break option or, if the probability that the break option will be exercised is considered low, over the lease term.
Property operating expenses are expensed as incurred and any property operating expenditure not recovered from tenants through service charges is charged to the income statement.
Gains on sale of properties Gains on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion of contract, and are calculated by reference to the carrying value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure.
Tenant leases Management has exercised judgement in considering the potential transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership in accordance with IAS 17 Leases for properties leased to tenants and has determined that such leases are operating leases.
Plant, equipment and owner-occupied property Owner-occupied property held under a finance lease is stated at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life, which is generally between three and five years, or in the case of leasehold improvements, the lease term.
Other investments Other investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
Where a significant or prolonged decline in fair value is identified, the investment is considered impaired and any cumulative revaluation gain or deficit is recycled through the income statement.
Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 79 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans comprises the amount of future benefit that employees have earned, discounted to determine a present value, less the fair value of the pension plan assets.
The discount rate used is the yield on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified external actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in equity.
Where the assets of a plan are greater than its obligation, the asset included in the balance sheet is limited to the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reduction in future contributions to the plan.
Share-based employee remuneration Share-based employee remuneration is determined with reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted and charged to the income statement over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
The fair value of share options is calculated using the binomial option pricing model and is dependent on factors including the exercise price, expected volatility, option life and risk-free interest rate.
The fair value of the market-based element of the Long-Term Incentive Plans is calculated using the Monte Carlo Model and is dependent on factors including the expected volatility, vesting period and risk-free interest rate.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment has been applied to share options granted.
Tax Tax is included in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case the related tax is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates applicable at the balance sheet date, together with any adjustment in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.

Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 81 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 3 Segmental analysis The factors used to determine the Groups reportable segments are the geographic locations UK and Continental Europe and sectors in which it operates, which are generally managed by separate teams and are the basis on which performance is assessed and resources allocated.
Gross rental income represents the Groups revenue from external customers, or tenants.
Net rental income is the principal profit measure used to determine the performance of each sector.
Total assets are not monitored by segment and resource allocation is based on the distribution of property assets between segments.
Further details are set out in note 21C.

6 Pensions Defined benefit pension schemes Hammerson Group Management Limited Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme The Scheme is funded and the funds, which are administered by trustees, are independent of the Groups finances.
The Scheme, which was closed to new entrants on 31 December 2002, provides a pension linked to final salary at retirement.
Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Scheme The unfunded scheme provides pension benefits to two former Executive Directors: one in the UK and one in France.
The amount of pension is linked to final salary at retirement.
The accrued benefits in respect of the former Executive Directors remain within the scheme and are now paid directly by the Group.
US Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Scheme The US unfunded pension commitment relates to obligations to four former employees and their spouses.
Defined contribution pension schemes The Company operates the UK funded approved Group Personal Pension Plan and the UK funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme, both of which are defined contribution pension schemes.

Deferred tax is not provided on potential gains on investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures when the Group can control whether gains crystallise and it is probable that gains will not arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2011 the total of such gains was 206 million 2010: 168 million and the potential tax effect before the offset of losses was 52 million 2010: 45 million.
If a UK REIT sells a property within three years of completion of development, the REIT exemption will not apply.
At 31 December 2011, the value of such completed development properties was 217 million 2010: 854 million and the potential tax charge that would arise if these properties were to be sold was nil 2010: nil.
E: UK REIT status The Group elected to be treated as a UK REIT with effect from 1 January 2007.
The UK REIT rules exempt the profits of the Groups UK property rental business from corporation tax.
Gains on UK properties are also exempt from tax, provided they are not held for trading or sold in the three years after completion of development.
The Group is otherwise subject to UK corporation tax.
As a REIT, Hammerson plc is required to pay Property Income Distributions equal to at least 90% of the Groups exempted net income.
To remain a UK REIT there are a number of conditions to be met in respect of the principal company of the Group, the Groups qualifying activity and its balance of business.
F: French SIIC status Hammerson plc has been a French SIIC since 1 January 2004 and all the major French properties are covered by the SIIC tax-exempt regime.
Income and gains are exempted from French tax but the French subsidiaries are required to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc, which will then designate UK dividends paid to its shareholders as SIIC distributions.
Dividend obligations will arise principally after property disposals but for the Hammerson group there will be a period of around four years after a disposal for dividends to be paid to shareholders.
Outstanding SIIC dividend obligations arising on disposals and earnings prior to 31 December 2011 amount to 127 million 2010: 203 million and are expected to be settled within dividends paid by Hammerson plc over the following four years.
A further 281 million 2010: 239 million of dividends would be payable if the properties were realised at their 31 December 2011 values.
Since 1 July 2009, qualifying foreign dividends have been exempt from UK tax and therefore no deferred tax provision is recognised.
If Hammerson plc ceased to qualify as a French SIIC before 1 January 2014, tax penalties of 163 million 2010: 199 million would be payable.
To continue to qualify, at least 80% of assets must be employed in property investment and, with limited temporary exceptions, no shareholder may hold 60% or more of the shares.
Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 89 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 9 Dividends The proposed final dividend of 9.3 pence per share was recommended by the Board on 23 February 2012 and, subject to approval by shareholders, is payable on 27 April 2012 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 16 March 2012.
7.0 pence will be paid as a PID, net of withholding tax if applicable, and the remainder of 2.3 pence per share will be paid as a normal dividend.
There will be no scrip alternative.
The aggregate amount of the 2011 final dividend is 66.2 million.
This has been calculated using the total number of eligible shares outstanding at 31 December 2011.
The interim dividend of 7.3 pence per share was paid on 7 October 2011.
5.5 pence per share was paid as a PID, net of withholding tax where appropriate, with the remaining 1.8 pence per share paid as a normal dividend.
The total dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 will be 16.6 pence per share 2010: 15.95 pence per share.

Variable rate borrowings bear interest based on LIBOR, with the exception of certain euro borrowings whose interest costs are linked to EURIBOR.
Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 99 Financial statements Notes to the accounts continued 21 Financial instruments and risk management Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Further discussion of these issues is set out in Risk management and principal uncertainties on page 24.
The Groups risk management policies and practices with regard to financial instruments are as follows: A: Debt management The Group generally borrows on an unsecured basis on the strength of its covenant in order to maintain operational flexibility.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short-term liquidity.
Acquisitions may be financed initially using short-term funds before being refinanced for the longer-term when market conditions are appropriate.
Short-term funding is raised principally through syndicated revolving credit facilities from a range of banks and financial institutions with whom Hammerson maintains strong working relationships.
Long-term debt mainly comprises the Groups fixed rate unsecured bonds.
B: Interest rate management Interest rate swaps are used to alter the interest rate basis of the Groups debt, allowing changes from fixed to variable rates or vice versa.
Clear guidelines exist for the Groups ratio of fixed to variable rate debt and management regularly reviews the interest rate profile against these guidelines.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had interest rate swaps of 100.0 million 2010: 100.0 million, 60.7 million 2010: 60.7 million and 41.2 million 2010: nil maturing in 2013, 2015 and 2018 respectively.
Under these swaps the Group pays interest at fixed rates of 4.725%, 2.455% and 3.075% respectively and receives interest linked to LIBOR and EURIBOR.
At 31 December 2011, the fair value of interest rate swaps was a liability of 10.6 million 2010: 8.5 million.
The fair value of interest rate swaps excludes derivatives embedded within 100 million of unsecured bank loans maturing in 2013 in accordance with IAS 39.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
C: Foreign currency management The impact of foreign exchange movements is managed by financing the cost of acquiring euro denominated assets with euro borrowings.
The Group borrows in euros and uses currency swaps to match foreign currency assets with foreign currency liabilities.
To manage the foreign currency exposure on its net investments in subsidiaries in Continental Europe, the Group has designated all euro borrowings, including euro denominated bonds and currency swaps, as hedges.
The carrying amount of the bonds at 31 December 2011 was 583.8 million 2010: 598.5 million and their fair value was 604.1 million 2010: 622.7 million.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had currency swaps of 476.2 million, being 552.0 million sold forward against sterling: 372.0 million for value in March 2012 at a rate of 1 1.162 and 180.0 million for value in June 2012, at a rate of 1 1.146.
At 31 December 2010, the Group had currency swaps of 501.3 million, being 590.1 million sold forward against sterling: 187.5 million for value in January 2011, at a rate of 1 1.182 and 402.6 million for value in February 2011, at a rate of 1 1.175.
The fair value of currency swaps is shown in note 21I.
The exchange differences on hedging instruments and on net investments in foreign subsidiaries are recognised in equity.
D: Profit and loss account and balance sheet management The Group maintains internal guidelines for interest cover, gearing and other ratios.
Management monitors the Groups current and projected financial position against these guidelines.
Further details of these ratios are provided in the Financial review on pages 39 to 41.
E: Cash management and liquidity Cash levels are monitored to ensure sufficient resources are available to meet the Groups operational requirements.
Short-term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
Longer-term liquidity requirements are met with an appropriate mix of short and longer-term debt as explained in note 21A above.
100 Hammerson plc | Annual Report 2011 Overview Business & financial review Governance Financial statements Property portfolio Other information Financial statements 21 Financial instruments and risk management continued F: Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank and cash balances, short-term deposits, trade and other receivables and investments.
The Groups credit risk is attributable to its trade and other receivables, cash and short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments.
Trade receivables consist principally of rents due from tenants.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and the Groups tenant base is diversified geographically, with tenants generally of good financial standing.
The majority of tenant leases are long-term contracts with rents payable quarterly in advance and the average unexpired lease term at 31 December 2011 was 8.4 years 2010: 8.8 years.
Rent deposits and personal or corporate guarantees are held in respect of some leases.
Taking these factors into account the risk to the Group of individual tenant default and the credit risk of trade receivables are considered low.
The Groups most significant tenants are set out in the Financial review on page 42.
Loans receivable and other receivables include balances due from joint venture partners, available for sale investments and VAT receivables.
These items do not give rise to significant credit risk.
The receivables in notes 16 and 17 are presented net of allowances for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
An analysis of trade receivables and the related provisions is shown in note 17.
The credit risk on short-term deposits and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks, who are committed lenders to the Group, with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
At 31 December 2011, the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk was 268.1 million 2010: 252.1 million.
G: Financial maturity analysis The following table provides a maturity analysis for income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities.

Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 December 2011, it is estimated that an increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have increased the Groups annual profit before tax by 2.8 million 2010: increase of 3.3 million and a decrease of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Groups annual profit before tax by 4.4 million 2010: decrease of 3.5 million.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings and loans receivable, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The decrease in the Groups annual profit before tax with a reduction in interest rates is due to the change in fair value of interest rate swaps having a greater charge than the saving on floating rate borrowings.
It is estimated that, in relation to financial instruments alone, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro, would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by 95.0 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity for the year ended 31 December 2011 by 116.1 million.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, a 10% strengthening of sterling against the euro would have increased the net gain taken directly to equity by 101.5 million.
A 10% weakening of sterling against the euro would have decreased the net gain taken directly to equity by 124.1 million.
However, these effects would be more than offset by the effect of exchange rate changes on the euro denominated net assets included in the Groups financial statements.
In relation to financial instruments alone, there would have been no impact on the Groups profit before tax.
This has been calculated by retranslating the year end euro denominated financial instruments at the year end foreign exchange rate changed by 10%.
Forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in this estimate.
I: Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of borrowings, currency and interest rate swaps, together with their carrying amounts included in the balance sheet, are as follows: 2011 2010 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Borrowings, excluding currency swaps 2,079.9 2,229.6 1,916.2 1,993.7 Currency swaps 15.0 15.0 4.4 4.4 Total 2,064.9 2,214.6 1,920.6 1,998.1 Interest rate swaps 10.6 10.6 8.5 8.5 At 31 December 2011, the fair value of financial instruments exceeded their book value by 149.7 million equivalent to 21 pence per share on an adjusted net asset value per share basis.
At 31 December 2010, the book value of financial instruments exceeded their fair value by 77.5 million, equivalent to 11 pence per share on an adjusted net asset value per share basis.
