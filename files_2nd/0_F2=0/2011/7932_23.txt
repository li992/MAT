Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 88 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Segment Information Imperial Tobacco comprises two distinct businesses Tobacco and Logistics.
In addition to regularly reviewing results and plans for the Tobacco and Logistics businesses, the Operating Executive which superseded the Chief Executives Committee on 1 October 2010 as the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of IFRS 8 regularly reviewed during the year the performance and plans of the Tobacco business analysed on a geographic basis, reflecting the importance of certain individual markets and geographic groupings.
The segments presented below are therefore the Groups six Tobacco regions and the Logistics business.
The information provided to the Operating Executive is used as the basis of the segment revenue and profit disclosures provided below, with the geographic analysis of Tobacco based on the location of customers, and central Group costs allocated consistently based on managements assessment of the level of support provided.
The main measure of profit used by the Operating Executive to assess performance is adjusted operating profit.
Segment balance sheet information is not provided to the Operating Executive.
The Tobacco business comprises the manufacture, marketing and sale of tobacco and tobacco-related products, including sales to but not by the Logistics business.
The Logistics business comprises the distribution of tobacco products for tobacco product manufacturers, including Imperial Tobacco, as well as a wide range of non-tobacco products and services.
The Logistics business is run on an operationally neutral basis ensuring all customers are treated equally, and consequently transactions between the Tobacco and Logistics businesses are undertaken on an arms length basis reflecting market prices for comparable goods and services.
For the purposes of the analysis below, Rest of European Union comprises the EU member states plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland.
The Cuban joint ventures are included in the Rest of the World.
All of the Logistics business is located in the European Union.

8 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the owners of the parent and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding shares held to satisfy the Groups employee share schemes and shares purchased by the Company and held as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by taking into account the weighted average number of shares that would be issued if rights held under the employee share schemes were exercised.
No instruments have been excluded from the calculation for any period on the grounds that they are anti-dilutive.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 95 Supply agreements includes Logistics customer relationships and exclusive supply arrangements in Cuba.
The exclusive supply arrangement in Morocco became fully amortised during the year ending 30 September 2011.
All were acquired under the purchase of Altadis.
The 41 million reduction in goodwill in 2010 reflects an adjustment in respect of the Reemtsma acquisition and is more fully described in note 28.
Amortisation and impairment in respect of acquired intangible assets are treated as reconciling items between reported operating profit and adjusted operating profit.
The adjustment comprises the amortisation and impairment charges in respect of goodwill, trademarks and supply agreements.
Goodwill and intangible asset impairment review Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are allocated to the Groups cash-generating units CGUs.
For the Tobacco business these are based on the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
A summary of the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives is set out below.
2011 2010 Intangible Intangible assets with assets with million Goodwill indefinite lives Goodwill indefinite lives Spain 1,511 1,520 Other European Union 4,814 126 4,836 127 Americas 1,842 106 1,828 105 Rest of the World 2,868 340 2,885 341 Cuban cigar joint ventures 291 252 289 250 Tobacco 11,326 824 11,358 823 Logistics 1,688 1,697 13,014 824 13,055 823 Goodwill has arisen principally on the acquisitions of Reemtsma in 2002 mainly Other European Union and Rest of the World, Commonwealth Brands in 2007 Americas and Altadis in 2008 all CGUs.
The Group tests goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are any indications that impairment may have arisen.
The value of a cash-generating unit is based on value-in-use calculations which use cash flow projections derived from three year financial plans which are approved by the Board annually.
The plans are based on detailed bottom-up market-by-market forecasts of projected sales volumes for each product line, and reflect, on an individual market basis, numerous assumptions and estimates regarding anticipated changes in market size, prices and duty regimes, consumer uptrading and downtrading, consumer preferences and other changes in product mix.
The estimates and assumptions are based on long-term market trends, market data, anticipated regulatory developments, and management experience and expectations.
We consider that pricing, market size, market shares and cost inflation are the key assumptions used in our plans.
The compound annual growth rates implicit in these value-in-use calculations are shown below.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using estimated long-term growth rates of between 2.7 per cent and 3.0 per cent per annum.
Discount rates used are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the different risk profiles of the CGUs.
Pre-tax discount rates ranged from 8.7 per cent to 11.3 per cent.
Growth rates used Initial Long-term growth rate rate Spain 10.9% 2.7% Other European Union 4.2% 3.0% Americas 10.4% 3.0% Rest of the World 11.8% 3.0% Cuban cigar joint ventures 7.6% 3.0% Logistics 4.3% 3.0% The initial growth rate is the weighted average compound annual growth rate based on the first three years cash flows used in the value-in-use calculations as described above and using 2011 as the base year.
For Other European Union, Rest of the World and Cuban cigar joint ventures these initial growth rates are broadly consistent with the actual constant currency growth rates since 2009 i. e. after, and excluding the effects of, the acquisition of Altadis.
The initial growth rate for Spain, at 10.9 per cent, is in part a reflection of 2011, the base year from which growth rates are calculated, having been adversely impacted by three specific factors.
Firstly, changes to excise duty in January 2010 and December 2010 led to increases in retail prices for consumers.
Secondly, the January 2011 extension of the ban on smoking in public places, particularly in combination with the increased retail prices following duty increases, contributed to a reduction in market volumes.
Thirdly, competitor pricing activity in the spring and summer months of 2011 significantly reduced margins during that period, although pricing in Spain is now back to the levels before the competitor activity took place.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 96 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 9 Intangible Assets continued Our experience in other markets is that the introduction or extension of smoking bans has a one-off adverse effect on volumes, but that this is shortly followed by longer term trends returning to normal patterns.
In addition, market activity in Spain in the latter part of 2011 has provided evidence of amelioration of the unusual recent conditions.
Consequently, management believes that, with the one-off effects of the smoking ban having passed, and with a more stable pricing environment having now emerged and expected to continue, there are reasonable prospects for growth in the Spanish market over the next three years and beyond.
The initial growth rate for the Americas, at 10.4 per cent, reflects the anticipated benefits of the re-organisation of our Americas business to combine our cigarette and mass market cigar sales forces, aligned with a single unified support structure, together with a number of other related initiatives.
The initial growth rate for our Logistics unit reflects the realisation of future benefits from our ongoing programme to reduce costs and to develop profitable lines of business.
Long-term growth rates are the weighted average compound annual growth rates used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial three years.
They are based on managements long-term expectations, taking account of industry specific factors such as the nature of our products, the role of excise in government fiscal policy, and relatively stable and predictable long-term macro trends in the Tobacco industry.
The long-term growth rate for Spain has been reduced from 3.0 per cent to 2.7 per cent in light of current uncertainty over prospects for the Spanish economy.
Sensitivity of impairment tests to changes in assumptions The impairment test for Spain indicated headroom of 30 million, and that an impairment would result in the event of either an increase in the discount rate of 10 basis points from 10.6 per cent, or a reduction of 30 basis points in the initial growth rate, or a 10 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate, or a 1 per cent reduction in the value of overall cash flows.
The impairment test for Americas indicated headroom of 410 million, and that an impairment would result in the event of either an increase in the discount rate of 110 basis points from 11.3 per cent or a 130 basis point reduction in the long-term growth rate.
In addition to the initial growth rates shown above applied to cash flows arising in existing markets, the valuation of the Cuban cigar joint ventures includes assumptions about the timing and extent of cash flows from entry to new markets.
The impairment test for the Cuban cigar joint ventures indicated headroom of 160 million, and that an increase of 160 basis points in the discount rate from 10.0 per cent would result in an impairment.
We do not consider any other reasonable movement in assumptions relating to Spain, the Americas and Cuban cigar joint ventures would result in an impairment.
For the rest of the Group, any reasonable movement in the assumptions used in the impairment tests would not result in an impairment.
No impairment charges have been recognised in the year in respect of goodwill and intangible assets.

Certain spares and consumables of individually low value have been reclassified from plant and equipment to other inventory as this better reflects their nature and pattern of use.
The net book value of these items was 31 million.
Also during the year a number of other items were reclassified including 8 million, at net book value, of software from fixtures and motor vehicles to intangible assets.

It is generally recognised industry practice to classify leaf tobacco inventory as a current asset although part of such inventory, because of the duration of the processing cycle, ordinarily would not be consumed within one year.
We estimate that around 120 million 2010: 140 million of leaf tobacco held within raw materials will not be utilised within a year of the balance sheet date.
During the year 31 million of spare parts were reclassified from plant and equipment to other inventories as this better reflects their nature and pattern of use.

It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions.
The Group Treasury Committee GTC oversees the operation of Group Treasury in accordance with terms of reference set out by the Board.
The Board reviews and approves all major treasury decisions.
The GTC currently comprises the Finance Director: Director of Finance Group Sales and Group Marketing: Director of Investor Communications: Cigar Business Unit Finance Director: Group Financial Controller: Senior Group Management Accountant Manufacturing: Group Treasurer and Interim Deputy Group Treasurer.
The GTC agrees a framework which sets out the current expectations and boundaries to assist in the effective oversight of Group Treasury activities, covering all key areas within Group Treasury.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including the provision of a monthly treasury report which is also provided to the GTC.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates due to its commercial trading transactions denominated in foreign currencies, foreign currency cash deposits, borrowings and non-sterling derivatives.
In 2011, 83 per cent of revenue 2010: 82 per cent and 81 per cent of adjusted profit from operations 2010: 80 per cent was in markets outside the UK.
Certain sales in these markets are invoiced in currencies other than the functional currency of the selling company.
Material costs denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of subsidiaries include the purchase of tobacco leaf, which is sourced from various countries but purchased principally in US dollars, and packaging materials which are sourced from various countries and purchased in a number of currencies.
After taking into account other US dollar inflows the Group currently does not consider this foreign exchange cash flow risk to be material enough to hedge.
The Group has a policy of managing its balance sheet translation risk by funding acquisitions and the underlying business assets with borrowings post cross currency swaps in the currency of the underlying net assets.
This also results in foreign currency profits from operations being partially offset by foreign currency interest costs thereby minimising the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group issues debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and has a policy of using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and foreign exchange swaps where necessary, to change the debt into the desired currency.
At 30 September 2011, approximately 36 per cent 2010: 27 per cent of adjusted net debt was denominated in sterling, 48 per cent in euro 2010: 50 per cent and 16 per cent in US dollars 2010: 23 per cent.
The Groups sterling dividend to shareholders is partly sourced from foreign subsidiary earnings.
In order to manage the foreign exchange cash flow risk, and to provide greater certainty as to the amount of sterling available to pay expected future dividends, the Group has entered into transactional cross currency swaps maturing between now and 2015 that will convert expected euro dividends from subsidiaries into sterling.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 100 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents.
Borrowings at variable rates expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Group Treasury monitors the Groups borrowing levels using adjusted net debt which excludes interest accruals, the fair value of derivative financial instruments providing commercial cash flow hedges and finance lease liabilities.
The Groups financial results are currently principally exposed to gains or losses arising from fluctuations in sterling, euro and US dollar interest rates.
In order to manage the interest rate risk on its borrowings, the Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and uses derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps where necessary, to change the debt into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
The Group then transacts interest rate swaps at other times for different notional amounts and for different maturities to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate risk.
At 30 September 2011, 24 per cent 2010: 29 per cent of adjusted net debt was at a floating rate of interest, 76 per cent 2010: 70 per cent at a fixed rate of interest and none 2010: 1 per cent floating within a set range.
The Group manages its interest rate exposure on a regular basis and reports the position monthly to the Board and GTC.
This report shows the profit or loss impact of a defined interest rate shift for each of the major currencies of borrowings and the forecast percentage of debt fixed for at least the next ten years.
The Group has no material interest rate repricing risk since the interest rates of derivative financial instruments reset quarterly, resulting in the interest being paid or received approximating current market rates.
Sensitivity analysis IFRS 7 requires a sensitivity analysis that illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and other comprehensive income due to hypothetical changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group has considered movements in interest rates and sterling foreign exchange rates over the last three years and has concluded that the rates shown in the table below represent reasonably possible changes.
The impacts on income and other comprehensive income of these changes are shown in the table below.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the amount of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives portfolio, and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the net investment hedge designations in place at 30 September 2011.
The sensitivity analysis does not reflect any change to revenue or non-finance costs that may result from changing interest or exchange rates.
All financial assets and liabilities held in the functional currency of subsidiary companies are excluded from the analysis.
The analysis also excludes instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.

The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange rate movements primarily relates to financial instruments that commercially hedge net investments, but are not accounted for as hedges under IAS 39 although they are commercially effective.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the commercially hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net impact on shareholders funds of zero.
Any gain or loss which arises is excluded from our adjusted performance measures.
The other comprehensive income impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value will be more than fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 101 Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk arising from its trade receivables due from customers, as well as from cash and cash deposits and the mark-to-market of derivative financial instruments transacted with financial institutions.
The Group considers its maximum credit risk to be 4,613 million at 30 September 2011 2010: 4,153 million.
The Group has some significant concentrations of customer credit risk.
However, the Group has implemented policies to ensure that sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history and obtains guarantees or other means of credit support to reduce the risk where this is considered to be necessary.
Analysis of trade and other receivables is provided in note 13.
The Group has a policy of having no concentrations of credit risk from financial institutions that are in excess of limits agreed by the Board.
The Group has placed cash deposits and entered into derivative financial instruments with a diversified group of financial institutions with suitable credit ratings in order to manage its credit risk to any one financial institution.
The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating and balances at 30 September 2011: 30 September 2011 30 September 2010 Maximum Maximum exposure to exposure to S&P credit risk S&P credit risk Counterparty credit rating million credit rating million Financial institution A A 223 A 137 Financial institution B AA 131 AA 80 Financial institution C AA 127 AA 49 Financial institution D AA 112 AA 23 Financial institution E A 98 A 16 Financial institution F A- 95 AFinancial institution G A 90 A 58 Management do not expect these counterparties to default on their current obligations.
Liquidity risk The Group is exposed to liquidity risk, which represents having insufficient funds to meet the financing needs of the Group.
To manage this risk the Group has a policy of actively maintaining a mixture of short, medium and long-term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for the forecast requirements of the Group over the short to medium term.
At 30 September 2011 the Group had 2,498 million 2010: 1,798 million of undrawn committed facilities, maturing in December 2015.
As well as forecasting and monitoring the Groups core liquidity needs, the Group Treasury function is in regular dialogue with subsidiary companies to ensure their liquidity needs are met.
Subsidiary companies are funded by a combination of share capital and retained earnings, loans from central finance companies on commercial terms, or through local borrowings by the subsidiaries in appropriate currencies.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by subsidiary companies are remitted to Group Treasury where practical and possible.
The table below summarises the Groups financial liabilities by maturity based on their contractual cash flows.
The contractual cash flows disclosed in the table include interest to be paid, are undiscounted and have been calculated using spot rates at the relevant balance sheet date.
The balance sheet amounts disclosed in the table for derivative financial liabilities include collateral of 278 million 2010: 243 million which has been transferred to counterparties in respect of certain derivatives with a negative fair value.
The future cash inflows arising from collateral transferred have not been allocated to time periods since there is no reasonable basis upon which to do so.

The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in that there may be fluctuations in the price of tobacco leaf.
As with other agricultural commodities, the price of tobacco leaf tends to be cyclical as supply and demand considerations influence tobacco plantings in those countries where tobacco is grown.
Also, different regions may experience variations in weather patterns that may affect crop quality or supply and so lead to changes in price.
The Group seeks to reduce this price risk by sourcing tobacco leaf from a number of different countries and counterparties and by varying the levels of tobacco leaf held.
Capital risk management The Group manages the capital structure in an efficient manner in order to minimise the cost of capital whilst ensuring that we have access to ongoing sources of finance such as the debt capital markets.
The Group defines capital as adjusted net debt see note 26 and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company see Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.
The only externally imposed capital requirements for the Group are interest cover and gearing covenants under the terms of the Senior Bank Facility, with which we have fully complied during both the current period and the prior period.
The Group manages the capital structure to maintain an investment grade credit rating and has taken and will continue to take the appropriate measures to maintain this, including consideration of the efficient return of capital to shareholders through an appropriate mix of share buy backs and dividends.
Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 103 Fair value estimation The fair values of financial assets and liabilities with maturities less than one year, other than derivatives, are considered to be approximate to their book values.
In accordance with the IFRS 7 classification hierarchy all derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2.
This means that they are valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data such as yield curves and foreign exchange rates.

Imperial Tobacco Group PLC|Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategy Risk Performance Governance Financials 106 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16 Borrowings and Derivative Financial Instruments continued iv Derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires that all derivative financial instruments are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the income statement unless the instrument satisfies the hedge accounting rules under IFRS and the Group chooses to designate the derivative financial instrument as a hedge.
The Group hedges underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict hedging requirements of IAS 39 may lead to some commercially effective hedge positions not qualifying for hedge accounting.
As a result, and as permitted under IAS 39, the Group has decided not to apply cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for its derivative financial instruments.
However, the Group does apply net investment hedging, designating certain borrowings and derivatives as hedges of the net investment in the Groups foreign operations, as permitted by IAS 39, in order to minimise income statement volatility.
See section vi below for details.
The information contained in sections ii and iii above shows the underlying borrowing position before the effect of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps.
The Group separates its borrowing activities from its interest rate risk management decisions by issuing debt in the market or markets that are most appropriate at the time of raising new finance and using derivative financial instruments, such as cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps, to change the debt into the desired currency and into floating interest rates shortly after issue.
The following tables set out the Groups borrowings and derivative financial instruments at 30 September 2011, and demonstrate the Groups use of derivative financial instruments to manage the Groups foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate exposures.
The tables present the nominal value of such instruments used to calculate the contractual payments under such contracts, analysed by maturity date, together with the related weighted average interest rate where relevant.
Seven of the interest rate swaps have embedded options and assumptions have been made based on market information and from counterparties expectations at 30 September 2011 to determine whether, and if so when, such options are likely to be exercised in order to determine the probable maturity date.
Details of these options and the expected maturity dates are included in the footnotes to the relevant tables.
The actual maturity date could be earlier or later depending upon future market conditions and a cancellation would not result in a cash flow other than in respect of interest outstanding at the cancellation date.
The effect of the cancellation of any of these interest rate swaps would be to reduce the proportion of the Groups borrowings that were at a fixed rate, increasing the Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.
Shortly after any such cancellation Group Treasury would, if deemed necessary as part of the management of interest rate risk, transact further interest rate swaps to replace the cancelled swaps.
It is currently believed that there is sufficient appetite amongst counterparties for such transactions.

Where a portion of a derivative financial instrument is to be cash settled within 12 months of the balance sheet date this portion has been classified as current with the remainder being classified as non-current.
Any collateral transferred to counterparties in respect of derivative financial instruments with negative fair values has been classified as current or non-current in line with the classification of the underlying derivative financial instrument since the substance of the collateral transactions is to extinguish the liabilities to counterparties.
Any excess collateral transferred to counterparties has been classified as current since it is reasonably expected to be returned within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
The overall effect of the interest rate swaps live at 30 September 2011 is to convert 6,711 million of borrowings into fixed rates in order to manage the Groups exposure to cash flow interest rate risk.

Gains or losses on the retranslation of these borrowings and derivatives are recognised as other comprehensive income to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the Groups foreign operations.
Permanent intragroup loans with a fair value of 6,365 million 2010: 6,365 million have been treated as a reduction in investments in the Groups foreign operations.
vii Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying amounts and fair values of all financial liabilities that are carried in the financial statements at amounts other than fair values.
All financial assets and liabilities are carried at amortised cost, other than derivative financial instruments that are carried at fair value.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables and trade payables are approximate to their fair value and so are excluded from the analysis below.
Derivative financial instruments are excluded as they are carried at fair value.

Deferred tax assets of 18 million 2010: 14 million have not been recognised due to the potential uncertainty of the utilisation of the underlying tax losses in certain jurisdictions.
Of these unrecognised deferred tax assets 12 million 2010: 11 million will expire within five years.
Also within other temporary differences, deferred tax assets of 113 million 2010: 90 million are recognised for tax credits carried forward to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 8 billion 2010: 7 billion.
A provision of 8 million 2010: 8 million has been made for taxation expected to arise on a planned future dividend payment of 117 million from one subsidiary.
No liability has been recognised in respect of other differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The rate of UK corporation tax was reduced by 2 per cent from 28 per cent to 26 per cent from 1 April 2011 and a further reduction to 25 per cent from 1 April 2012 was enacted at the balance sheet date.
Further reductions of 1 per cent per annum are expected to be enacted each year resulting in a reduction to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014.
The overall effect of a further reduction to 23 per cent, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September 2011, would be to reduce the deferred tax liability by 4 million.
18 Retirement Benefit Schemes The Group operates a number of retirement benefit schemes for its employees, including both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The Groups two principal schemes are final salary defined benefit schemes and are operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited in the UK and Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH in Germany.
The UK schemes assets are held in trustee administered funds while the German scheme is unfunded.
The UK defined benefit scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 October 2010 and new employees are now offered a defined contribution scheme instead.
The results of the most recent actuarial valuation for the principal UK scheme have been updated to 30 September 2011 by Towers Watson Limited, actuaries and consultants, in order to determine the amounts to be included in the balance sheet and income statement.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of other schemes of the Group were made as at or updated to 30 September 2011 by the various actuaries to those schemes.

The bond return is based on current market yields.
The corporate bond yield has been reduced to allow for an element of default risk.
The return on equities and property is based on a number of factors including the income yield at the measurement date, the long-term growth prospects for the economy in general, the long-term relationship between each asset class and bond returns, and the movement in market indices since the previous measurement date.

This level of contribution will be reviewed again at the next triennial valuation in 2013 at which time future payments may be increased or decreased.
In relation to the triennial valuation, the assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the ITPFs liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return on the ITPFs existing assets, the rates of increase in pay and pensions and estimated mortality rates.
On the basis that the ITPF is continuing, it was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5.5 per cent per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 5.0 per cent and 3.5 per cent respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2010 the market value of the invested assets of the ITPF was 2,622 million.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 100 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 88 per cent of the total benefits that had accrued to members for past service and future service benefits for current members.

They affect sales and marketing, manufacturing and central support functions in a number of markets and have largely been implemented.
The remaining provisions are expected to be used over a number of years.
Other provisions principally relate to commercial legal claims and disputes.
The majority of other provisions represent the fair value at acquisition of current and potential Altadis commercial disputes, litigation and duty claims arising in the normal course of business.
These liabilities are expected to crystallise within the next five years.

Share Matching Scheme Awards are made to eligible employees who are invited to invest a proportion of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC shares for a period of three years, after which additional shares are awarded on a 1:1 ratio.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP Awards of shares under the LTIP are made to the Executive Directors and senior executives at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
They vest three years after grant and are subject to performance criteria based on adjusted EPS growth and total shareholder returns compared to the FTSE 100 and a comparator group.
Sharesave Plan Options are granted to eligible employees who participate in a designated savings scheme for a three or five year period.
Further details of the schemes including additional criteria applying to directors and some senior executives are set out in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 60 to 74.

The vesting period remaining and the exercise price of options outstanding are weighted averages.
Participants in the Sharesave Plan have six months from the maturity date to exercise their option.
Participants in the LTIP have seven years from the end of the vesting period to exercise their option.
The exercise price of the options is fixed over the life of each option, except that following the rights issue in 2008, adjustments were made to the share plans outstanding at that time.
In respect of the Share Matching Scheme, the Trustees sold sufficient rights nil paid to enable the balance of the rights to be taken up.
In the case of the Sharesave Plan and LTIP, the number of shares under option or subject to awards were adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.
In the case of the Sharesave Plan the option price was also adjusted by the relevant bonus factor.
Pricing For the purposes of valuing options to calculate the share-based payment charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been used for the Share Matching Scheme and Sharesave Plan.

The purchase of shares by the Trusts has been financed by a gift of 19.2 million and an interest free loan of 181.9 million.
In addition the Group has gifted treasury shares to the Trusts.
None of the Trusts shares has been allocated to employees or Executive Directors as at 30 September 2011.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the Trusts are charged to the income statement as they accrue.
The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amounts in respect of these cases in the consolidated financial statements.
In 2003 the Office of Fair Trading OFT commenced an investigation under the Competition Act 1998 into the operation of the UK tobacco supply industry in the period from 2000 to 2003.
In a decision dated 15 April 2010, the OFT concluded that certain of the Groups promotional arrangements with tobacco retailers had the object of restricting competition and imposed a fine of 112.3 million on the Group.
At the same time it confirmed that two other allegations included in its 2008 statement of objections had been dropped.
The Group takes compliance with competition law very seriously and continues to reject any suggestion that it acted in breach of the Competition Act or in any way contrary to the interests of consumers.
On 15 June 2010 the Group submitted an appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal against the OFTs findings of infringement and the level of the fine.
Five tobacco retailers also submitted appeals against the OFTs decision.
The appeal is currently being heard by the Competition Appeal Tribunal which may uphold, quash or vary the OFTs decision or the fine that has been imposed.
As part of its appeal the Group has asked for the fine to be quashed in its entirety.
Consequently, the Group has not provided for any amount in the consolidated financial statements.

2010 During 2010, agreement was reached with the sellers of Reemtsma regarding the reimbursement and settlement of costs incurred by the Group as a consequence of investigations into alleged foreign trading violations prior to our acquisition of Reemtsma in 2002.
Reimbursement of 27 million received in cash and 14 million of costs settled directly by the sellers on behalf of the Group have been treated as an adjustment to the cost of the Reemtsma acquisition and so are reflected as a reduction to goodwill of 41 million in note 9.
To the extent that costs were settled directly by the sellers they have been shown as a non-cash movement of 14 million to arrive at operating cash flow before movement in working capital in note 25.
Costs of 24 million incurred in 2010 have been recognised in the 2010 consolidated income statement in administrative and other expenses, and have been excluded from our adjusted performance measures since the costs did not relate to the trading performance of the Group.
