Further information on these items is shown in notes 1, 4, 5, 7 and 28. Business to be closed closed businesses comprise PC City Spain for which plans for its closure were announced on 14 April 2011 and Markantalo and PC City Sweden whereby these store based businesses were closed on 10 May 2009 and 20 May 2009, respectively.
