In accordance with FRS 17, fide La Rue plc accounts for its contributions as though it were a defined contribution scheme.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme cover the Company and a number of its subsidiaries and those assets and liabilities cannot be split between each subsidiary on a consistent and reasonable basis.
Full details of the scheme and its deficit measured on an IAS 19 basis can be found in note 24 to the consolidated Financial Statements.
