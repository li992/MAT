Segmental information The Group is organised on a geographical basis and derives its revenue from the provision of colocation and related services in France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom.
Due to similarities in services, customers, regulatory environment and economic characteristics across the countries in which the Group operates, theGroup aggregates certain operating segments in order to provide more meaningful analysis.
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board of Directors the Board.
The Board reviews the Groups internal reporting in order toassess performance and allocate resources.
Management has determined the reportable segments based on these reports.
The Board considers the business from a geographic perspective and principally assesses the performance of the UK and the Rest of Europe.
When further detail is required the results of individual countries are reviewed.
Therefore the Board has determined the reportable segments to be the UK andtheRest of Europe.
Following the acquisition of Data Electronics note 17 the Ireland business is no longer managed as part of the UK business.
As such Ireland is now included in the Rest of Europe segment: previously it was included in the UK and Ireland segment.
The comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Treasury and financing is managed on a Group-wide basis: as such it is not practical to allocate costs below operating profit to an individual reportingsegment.
The above segmental results are shown after eliminating inter-segment trading of 1,989,000 2010: nil.
The Group had no customers from which greater than 10% of revenue was derived during the year.
74 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 3.
Segmental information continued The Board assesses the performance of the reportable segments based primarily on key performance indicators KPIs which are set out below.
These KPIs have been chosen because they are considered to be the main indicators of the Groups performance.
To the extent it is not practical to measure a KPI by reportable segment due to, for example, the common financing structure, the Group KPI is given.
Other information provided to the Board is measured in a manner consistent with that in the financial statements.

The following table shows the Groups assets and liabilities allocated to segments.
Segment assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets, trade and other receivables, and cash and cash equivalents.
Segment liabilities principally comprise trade and other payables, deferred income and provisions for other liabilities and charges.
Certain assets and liabilities, for example Group treasury cash balances and bank borrowings, are managed on a central basis and as such have not been allocated to individual segments.

Accordingly, the Groups UK profits for 2011 were taxed at an effective rate of 26.5% and will be taxed at 26% in the future.
This is expected to reduce both the UK current and deferred tax charges in future from what they otherwise would have been.
In addition to the amounts that have been charged to the income statement, the following amounts of tax have been charged directly to equity: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 000 000 Tax effect of interest rate cash flow hedges 39 366 Tax on net investment items 1,375 1,414 366 Overview Business model and Financial review Governance review Financial statements Investor information operating review 79 Telecity Group plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Financial statements Independent auditors report Consolidated income statement Consolidated statement  Consolidated statement of changes in equity Company statement of changes in equity Consolidated balance sheet Company balance sheet Consolidated cash flow statement Notes to the financial statements Directors report 12.

During the prior year, the Group recognised previously unrecognised tax losses totalling 4,906,000.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset only when they arise in the same tax jurisdiction, the amounts are expected to reverse in similar periods and the amounts would be available for offset.
The analysis of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities is as follows: 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Group 000 000 Deferred tax assets: deferred tax assets to be recovered after more than 12 months 1,837 4,818 deferred tax assets to be recovered within 12 months 4,096 1,841 5,933 6,659 Deferred tax liabilities: deferred tax liabilities to be recovered after more than 12 months 18,026 5,009 deferred tax liabilities to be recovered within 12 months 18,026 5,009 Deferred tax assets net 12,093 1,650 The analysis of deferred income tax assets and liabilities, without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction, is as follows: Intangible customer Tax Accelerated tax contract Onerous lease losses depreciation valuation liability Other Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 1 January 2010 17,281 8,114 4,278 2,143 908 6,124 Recognition of previously unrecognised tax losses 4,906 4,906 Charged credited to income statement 4,241 5,404 645 280 1,415 7,865 Credited to other comprehensive income 366 366 Acquisition of subsidiary 418 524 1,532 1,638 Foreign exchange movements 228 50 51 14 243 At 31 December 2010 18,136 13,992 5,165 1,812 859 1,650 Charged credited to income statement 6,456 1,816 1,222 208 981 5,861 Charged to other comprehensive income 1,375 39 1,414 Acquisition of subsidiaries note 17 563 5,834 6,397 Foreign exchange movements 170 152 47 6 71 At 31 December 2011 10,135 16,219 9,777 1,973 1,795 12,093 Deferred income tax assets are recognised for tax losses to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
In addition to the amounts recognised above, the Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to tax losses of approximately 16,169,000 2010: 16,519,000 which relates to several of the Groups subsidiary companies.
The aggregate amount of taxable temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries has not been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

A segment-level summary ofgoodwill allocation is presented below: Year ended 31 December 2011 Year ended 31 December 2010 Rest of Rest of UK Europe Total UK Europe Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Goodwill 42,454 54,199 96,653 36,337 7,099 43,436 The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three-year period.
Cash flows beyond the three-year period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates of 4% 2010: 4% for both the UK and Rest of Europe.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the operating segment in which the CGU operates.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the pre-tax cash flow projections was 10% 2010: 12% again for both the UK and rest of Europe.
Thediscount rates used are pre-tax and reflect specific risks relating to the relevant segments.
Due to the current and expected future profitability of the Group, there are significant levels of headroom in the impairment tests.

Trade receivables impairment disclosures Due to effective credit control procedures, the Group is not significantly exposed to the risk of bad debt.
In addition the Groups up front billing cycle means that customers are generally due to pay in advance of receiving the service.
The following disclosures are in respect of trade receivables that are either impaired or past due.
The credit quality of the remaining trade receivables is considered good.
Included within trade receivables is an amount of 3,058,000 2010: 2,949,000 in respect of amounts which are past their due date.
These relate to a number ofindependent customers for whom there is considered to be little risk of default and therefore such amounts have not been impaired.
The ageing analysis of these amounts is shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 000 000 Up to three months 2,773 2,433 Three to six months 151 148 More than six months 134 368 3,058 2,949 In addition to the above amounts, the Group has a number of trade receivables that are impaired.
The impairment balance relates to receivables with a gross value of 1,353,000 2010: 2,034,000.
The individually impaired receivables mainly relate to customers who are in unexpectedly difficult economic situations.
Any impairment is assessed on a customer-by-customer basis following a detailed review of the particular circumstances.
To the extent they have not been specifically provided against, the trade receivables are considered to be of sound credit rating.
The ageing analysis of these amounts is shown below: Year ended Year ended 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 000 000 Up to three months 1,060 1,326 Three to six months 82 355 More than six months 211 353 1,353 2,034 Movements on the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables are as follows.
