Governance Governance 19 Directors report contained and derived from publicly available information regarding properties and mining operations owned by third parties.
The Groups management relies upon this forward-looking information in its estimates, projections, plans, and analysis.
Although the forwardlooking statements contained in this Annual Report are based upon what the Group believes are reasonable assumptions, there can be no assurance that actual results will be consistent with these forwardlooking statements.
The forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report relate only to events or information as of the date on which the statements are made and, except as specifically required by applicable laws, listing rules and other regulations, the Group undertakes no obligation to update or revise publicly any forwardlooking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, after the date on which the statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.
Going concern After making enquiries and reviewing the Groups forecasts and projections, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The Group therefore continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its consolidated financial statements.
