Section 5 | Financial statements Notes to the Company Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Current tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax The charge for taxation takes account of taxation deferred because of differences between the timing of recognition of certain items for taxation purposes and for accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only when it is considered more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is recognised on a non-discounted basis using tax rates in force at the date the timing differences are expected to reverse.
