The impact of this rate change is a 12m reduction in the tax charge in the income statement.
Proposed future reductions in the UK tax rate to 23% will be reflected when the relevant legislation is substantively enacted.
Deferred taxation balances are analysed in note 13.
The 2011 final dividend of 16.85 pence, total value of 133m, will be paid on 13 January 2012 to shareholders on the register on 9 December 2011.
Dividends relating to the period were 24.75 pence per share totalling 195m 2010 23.8 pence per share totalling 188m.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 77 7.
Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share at 17 September 2011 was based on the net profit attributable to equity shareholders of 541m 2010 546m, and a weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year of 788 million 2010 788 million.
The calculation of the weighted average number of shares excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust on which the dividends are being waived.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share, which exclude the impact of profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets and sale and closure of businesses, amortisation of non-operating intangibles, and the associated tax credits, is shown to provide clarity on the underlying performance of the group.
The diluted earnings per share calculation takes into account the dilutive effect of share options and share incentives.
The diluted, weighted average number of shares is 788 million 2010 788 million.
There is no difference between basic and diluted earnings.

Intangible assets continued Impairment of goodwill As at 17 September 2011, the consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of 1,358m 2010 1,350m.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination that gave rise to the goodwill, as follows: 2011 2010 CASH-GENERATING UNIT CGU OR GROUP OF CGUS Primary reporting segment m m ACH Grocery 245 248 AB Mauri Ingredients 358 344 Twinings Ovaltine Grocery 119 119 Capullo Grocery 58 58 Illovo Sugar 184 193 AB World Foods Grocery 58 58 North China Sugar Sugar 68 65 Other Various 268 265 1,358 1,350 The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU or group of CGUs is not individually significant.
A CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has been allocated must be assessed for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment.
These calculations are performed annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
t The carrying value of goodwill has been assessed with reference to value in use to perpetuity reecting the projected cash ows of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs based on the most recent budget.
Growth rates for the period not covered by the annual budget are based on a range of growth rates that reect the products, industries and countries in which the relevant CGU or group of CGUsoperate.
t The key assumptions on which the cash ow projections for the most recent annual budget are based relate to discount rates, growth rates and expected changes in selling prices and direct costs.
t The cash ow projections have been discounted using a range of rates based on the groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital adjusted for specic risks of the business if necessary.
The rates used vary between 8% and 12% 2010 between 8% and 11%.
t The growth rates applied in the value in use calculations for goodwill allocated to each of the CGUs or groups of CGUs that is significant to the total carrying amount of goodwill were in a range between 0% and 2.5% 2010 between 0% and 2.5%.
t For some recently acquired intangible assets, management expects to achieve growth over the next three to five years in excess of the long-term growth rates for the applicable country or region.
In these circumstances, the cash ow forecast is extended to between three and five years using specic growth assumptions.
t Changes in selling price and direct costs are based on past results and expectations of future changes in the market.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions Impairment testing is dependent on managements estimates and judgements, particularly as they relate to the forecasting of future cash flows, the discount rates selected, and expected long-term growth rates.
Each of the groups CGUs had significant headroom under the annual impairment review with the exception of AB Mauri and the sugar business in north east China.
In AB Mauri, higher molasses costs and increased competitive pressures in its businesses around the world have resulted in an indicator of impairment risk under the strict requirements of IFRS.
Management has reviewed forecasts for this business taking those issues into account, and has concluded that no impairment is required.
In North China Sugar, current forecasts continue to support the carrying value of the assets of the business, but the achievement of these forecasts depends on significant improvements in agricultural yields and factory volumes.
Management will closely monitor the value in use of these CGUs.
For all goodwill other than AB Mauri and North China Sugar, management has concluded that no reasonably possible change in key assumptions on which it has determined value in use would cause carrying values to exceed value in use..

Construction and commissioning of this significant new factory is progressing.
Management has considered forecasts for the future performance of the business when the new factory is fully operational as planned, and has concluded that no impairment is required for the assets included above.
In 2010, the impairment of land and buildings related to the sugar business in North China and was included within profits less losses on disposal of non-current assets.

At the valuation date the total market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,223m and represented 93% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Following completion of the actuarial valuation, the group agreed to make five annual payments of 30m in order to eliminate the deficit at 5 April 2008.
The third of these payments was made in March 2011.

Employee entitlements continued Overseas schemes The group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in Australia and New Zealand, the United States, Canada, the Republic of Ireland, Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, the Philippines, Thailand, South Africa and Zambia.
These schemes are primarily funded schemes.
The charge for the year is based on recommendations by qualified actuaries.
Unfunded post-retirement medical benefit schemes are accounted for as defined benefit pension schemes.
Assumptions The UK pension schemes represent 90% 2010 89% of the groups scheme assets and 88% 2010 88% of the groups scheme liabilities.
The financial assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes under IAS 19, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, are: 2011 2010 2009 % % % Discount rate 5.1 5.2 5.7 Inflation 3.3 3.5 3.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.3 5.0 5.0 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.1 3.3 3.3 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.8 3.0 3.5 The mortality assumptions used to value the UK pension schemes are derived from the S1NA generational mortality tables with improvements in line with the projection model prepared by the Continuous Mortality Investigation of the UK actuarial profession, with no rating with a long-term underpin of 1.5%.
These mortality assumptions take account of experience to date, and assumptions for further improvements in life expectancy of scheme members.
Examples of the resulting life expectancies are as follows: 2011 2010 LIFE EXPECTANCY FROM AGE 65 IN YEARS Male Female Male Female Member aged 65 in 2011 2010 22.5 24.6 20.9 23.1 Member aged 65 in 2031 2030 24.7 27.0 22.7 25.0 The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.
For the overseas schemes, regionally appropriate assumptions have been used where recommended by local actuaries.
Balance sheet The expected rates of return and market values of the assets of the principal schemes were as follows: 2011 2011 2010 2010 2009 2009 UK SCHEMES % m % m % m Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 6.7 827 7.1 831 7.2 674 Government bonds 3.7 631 4.1 542 4.2 673 Non-government bonds 5.1 939 5.2 919 5.7 696 Property 5.2 102 5.6 90 5.7 75 Other 0.5 7 0.5 23 0.5 17 Total market value of plan assets 2,506 2,405 2,135 Present value of scheme liabilities 2,490 2,434 2,211 Net pension asset liability 16 29 76 Unfunded liability included in the present value of scheme liabilities above 17 15 11 The plan assets, scheme liabilities and aggregate net surplus of the plans were respectively 2,202m, 2,117m and 85m in 2008 and 2,256m, 1,972m and 284m in 2007.

Employee entitlements continued The sensitivities regarding the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities at 17 September 2011 are: Change in assumption Impact on scheme liabilities Discount rate decrease increase by 0.5% increase decrease by 8.9% Inflation increase decrease by 0.5% increase decrease by 7.8% Rate of increase in salaries increase decrease by 0.5% increase decrease by 1.5% Rate of mortality reduce by one year increase by 2.6% 2011 2011 2010 2010 2009 2009 OVERSEAS SCHEMES % m % m % m Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 8.0 128 7.7 112 8.8 102 Government bonds 4.7 36 4.3 34 7.0 69 Non-government bonds 3.5 53 2.9 41 4.1 36 Property 5.2 6 7.1 5 5.9 6 Other 5.9 59 6.3 93 5.4 25 Total market value of plan assets 282 285 238 Present value of scheme liabilities 334 342 242 Aggregate net deficit of the plans 52 57 4 Irrecoverable surplus a 8 13 26 Net pension liability 60 70 30 Unfunded liability included in the present value of scheme liabilities above 34 36 32 The plan assets, scheme liabilities and aggregate net surplus of the plans were respectively 222m, 211m and 11m in 2008 and 218m, 192m and 26m in 2007. a The surpluses in the plans are only recoverable to the extent that the group can benefit from either refunds formally agreed or from future contribution reductions.
The expected rate of return on plan assets was determined, based on actuarial advice, by a process that takes the long-term rate of return on government bonds available at the balance sheet date and with a similar maturity to the scheme liabilities, and applies to these rates suitable risk premia that take account of historic market returns and current market long-term expectations for each asset class.
The UK schemes net pension asset of 16m 2010 29m liability plus the overseas schemes net pension liability of 60m 2010 70m liability totals a liability of 44m 2010 99m.
This equates to the employee benefits asset of 35m 2010 nil and liability of 79m 2010 99m shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.

In addition, there are temporary differences of 2,095m 2010 1,789m relating to investments in subsidiaries.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of these differences, since the timing of the reversals can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the future.

Share-based payments The group had the following equity-settled share-based payment plans in operation during the period: Associated British Foods plc 1994 Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme This scheme was established by the Company in 1994.
Under the terms of the 1994 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company were granted to selected qualifying employees over the ten years from November 1994.
The options must be held for five years before they become exercisable.
The exercise of options is not subject to specified performance criteria.
Associated British Foods 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme the 2000 Scheme This scheme was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 15 December 2000.
Under the terms of the 2000 Scheme, options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company may be granted to selected employees over the ten years from 15December 2000.
The options must be held for three years before they become exercisable.
The exercise of an option under this scheme will, in accordance with institutional shareholder guidelines, be conditional on the achievement of performance criteria which are based on growth in the groups profits.
Associated British Foods Executive Share Incentive Plan 2003 the Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan was approved and adopted by the Company at the annual general meeting held on 5 December 2003.
It takes the form of conditional allocations of shares which will be released if, and to the extent that, certain performance targets are satisfied over a three-year performance period.

Fair values The weighted average fair values for the 1994 Scheme and the 2000 Scheme were determined using a binomial lattice model for share options or by taking the market price of the shares at the time of grant and discounting for the fact that dividends are not paid during the vesting period for conditional allocations of shares.
The weighted average fair value of the shares awarded under the Share Incentive Plan during the year was 999 pence 2010 801 pence and the weighted average share price was 1,074 pence 2010 862 pence.
The dividend yield used was 2.5%.
No options were granted under the 1994 Scheme or the 2000 Scheme in either 2010 or 2011.

Financial instruments continued The methods and assumptions used to estimate fair values of financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Financial asset liability Fair value determination Cash and cash equivalents Fair values have been stated at book values due to short maturities or otherwise immediate or short-term access and realisability.
Trade receivables, other receivables and accrued income Trade payables, other payables and accruals Other non-current investments recorded within other These comprise minority shareholdings held primarily in privately owned, non-current receivables unquoted companies, where there is no active market available to value them.
Where the fair value of the equity instruments cannot be reliably measured, they are recorded at cost.
Where shareholdings are held in publicly quoted companies, bid price is used to estimate fair value.
Other long-term receivables Fair values have been estimated by discounting expected future cashflows.
Bank loans, overdrafts and debenture stock Finance leases Derivatives Fair values are typically determined either by reference to third-party valuations usually from a bank, or by reference to readily observable marketprices.
The groups derivatives primarily cover a period of no more than 12 months from the balance sheet date, and information derived from an active market is almost always available to assist with the valuation ofderivatives.
Provisions These are measured at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Consequently, fair value is equivalent to book value.
Valuation of financial instruments carried at fair value Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet comprise other non-current investments and derivatives.
The group classifies these financial instruments using a fair value hierarchy that reflects the relative significance of both objective evidence and subjective judgements on the inputs used in making the fair value measurements: t Level 1: financial instruments are valued using observable inputs that reect unadjusted quoted market prices in an active market for identical instruments.
An example of an item in this category is a widely traded equity instrument with a normal quoted market price.
t Level 2: financial instruments are valued using techniques based on observable inputs, either directly i. e. market prices and rates or indirectly i. e. derived from market prices and rates.
An example of an item in this category is a currency derivative, where forward exchange rates and yield curve data which are observable in the market are used to derive fair value.
t Level 3: financial instruments are valued using techniques involving significant unobservable inputs.

d Financial risk identication and management The group is exposed to the following financial risks from its use of financial instruments: t market risk: t credit risk: and t liquidity risk.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 96 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 17 September 2011 24.
Financial instruments continued The groups financial risk management process seeks to enable the early identification, evaluation and effective management of key risks facing the business.
Risk management policies and systems have been established and are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the groups activities.
The group, through its standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The group sources and sells products and manufactures goods in a wide variety of locations around the world.
These operations expose the group to potentially significant price volatility in the financial and commodity markets.
Trading and risk management teams have been established in the groups major businesses to manage this exposure by entering into a range of products, including physical and financial forward contracts, futures and, where appropriate, options.
These teams work closely with group Treasury and report regularly to executivemanagement.
Treasury operations and commodity procurement are conducted within a clearly defined framework of board-approved policies and guidelines to manage the groups financial and commodity risks.
Treasury works closely with the groups procurement teams to manage commodity risks.
Treasury policy seeks to ensure that adequate financial resources are available to the group at all times, for the management and development of the groups businesses, whilst effectively managing its market risk and credit risk.
The groups risk management policy explicitly forbids the use of financial or commodity derivatives outside its risk management framework of mitigating financial and commodity risks for speculative purposes.
e Foreign currency translation The group presents its financial statements in sterling.
As a result of its diverse worldwide operations, the group is exposed to foreign currency translation risk where overseas operations have a functional currency other than sterling.
Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation into sterling of both the income statement and net assets of these foreign operations.
Where appropriate, the group finances its operations by borrowing locally in the functional currency of its operations.
This reduces net asset values reported in functional currencies other than sterling, thereby reducing the economic exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on translation.
The group also finances its operations by obtaining funding at group level through external borrowings and, where they are not in sterling, these borrowings may be designated as net investment hedges.
This enables gains and losses arising on retranslation of these foreign currency borrowings to be charged to other comprehensive income, providing a partial offset in equity against the gains and losses arising on translation of the net assets of foreign operations.
The group does not actively hedge the translation impact of foreign exchange rate movements on the income statement other than via the partial economic hedge arising from the servicing costs on non-sterling borrowings, nor does it use derivatives to hedge its net investments in foreign operations.
The group designates certain of its intercompany loan arrangements as quasi-equity for the purposes of IAS 21.
The effect of the designation is that any foreign exchange volatility arising within the borrowing entity and or the lending entity is accounted for directly within other comprehensive income.
The group has foreign currency borrowings that have been designated as hedges of its net investment in foreign operations in euros and US dollars.
The value of these financial liabilities used as hedging instruments at the balance sheet date was: 2011 2010 m m Euro 52 50 US dollar 296 300 348 350 The foreign exchange gain of 2m 2010 loss of 11m on retranslation of these loans has been taken to the translation reserve on consolidation.
Of this balance, 1m was attributable to equity shareholders and 1m to non-controlling interests 2010 loss of 9m to equity shareholders and loss of 2m to non-controlling interests.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 97 24.
Financial instruments continued f Market risk Market risk is the risk of movements in the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument or forecast transaction as underlying market prices change.
The group is exposed to changes in the market price of commodities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
These risks are known as transaction or recognised exposures and economic or forecast exposures.
i Commodity price risk Commodity price risk arises from the procurement of raw materials and the consequent exposure to changes in market prices.
The group purchases a wide range of commodities in the ordinary course of business.
Exposure to changes in the market price of certain of these commodities including wheat, edible oils, soya beans, meat, sugar raws, cocoa, rice, tea and energy is managed through the use of forward physical contracts and hedging instruments, including futures and options contracts, primarily to convert floating or indexed prices to fixed prices.
The use of such contracts to hedge commodity exposures is governed by the groups risk management policies and is continually monitored by group Treasury.
Commodity derivatives also provide a way to meet customers pricing requirements whilst achieving a price structure consistent with the groups overall pricing strategy.
Some of the groups commodity derivatives are treated as own use contracts, since they are both entered into, and continue to be held, for the purposes of the groups ordinary operations, and the group takes physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Own use contracts do not require accounting entries until the commodity purchase actually crystallises.
Certain other commodity derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges, but some are not eligible for treatment as own use contracts and are not contracts for which the strict requirements of hedge accounting can be satisfied.
This occurs typically where the group does not take physical delivery of the commodity concerned.
Such commodity derivatives are used only where the business believes they provide an economic hedge of an underlying exposure.
These instruments are classified as held for trading and are marked to market through the income statement.
The majority of the groups forward physical contracts and commodity derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The group does not have significant sensitivities in respect of the accounting for its on-balance sheet commodity contracts.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate risk comprises two primary elements: t interest price risk results from financial instruments bearing xed interest rates.
Changes in oating interest rates therefore affect the fair value of these xed rate financial instruments: and t interest cash ow risk results from financial instruments bearing oating rates.
Changes in oating interest rates affect cash ows on interest receivable or payable.
The groups policy is to maintain floating rate debt for a significant proportion of its bank finance, although it periodically assesses its position with respect to interest price and cash flow risk.
At 17 September 2011, 564m 35% 2010 600m and 52% of total debt was subject to fixed rates of interest.
The groups fixed rate 3 debt includes the US Private Placement loan of 394m 2010 397m and the 150m 10 4% secured redeemable debenture stock 2013 2010 150m.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings bearing interest rates fixed in advance, for various time periods up to 12 months, by reference to official market rates e. g. LIBOR.
The group does not have significant sensitivities to the impact of interest rates on derivative valuations, nor to the impact of interest rates on floating rate borrowings.
iii Foreign currency risk The group conducts business worldwide and consequently in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates which affect the groups transaction costs.
The group also publishes its financial statements in sterling and is therefore exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates on the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into sterling.
Translation risk is discussed in section e above.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 98 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 17 September 2011 24.
Financial instruments continued Transaction risk Currency transaction exposure occurs where a business makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
It also arises where monetary assets and liabilities of a business are not denominated in its functional currency, and where dividends or surplus funds are remitted from overseas.
The groups policy is to match transaction exposures wherever possible, and to hedge actual exposures and firm commitments as soon as they occur by using forward foreign currency contracts.
All foreign currency instruments contracted with non-group entities to manage transaction exposures are undertaken by group Treasury or, where foreign currency controls restrict group Treasury acting on behalf of subsidiaries, under its guidance.
Identification of transaction exposures is the responsibility of each business.
The group uses derivatives principally forward foreign currency contracts and time options to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
The group does not seek formal fair value hedge accounting for such transaction hedges.
Instead, such derivatives are classified as held for trading and marked to market through the income statement.
This offsets the income statement impact of the retranslation of the foreign currency trade receivables and payables.
Economic forecast risk The group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to movements in exchange rates on its highly probable forecast foreign currency sales and purchases on a rolling 12 month basis.
The group does not formally define the proportion of highly probable forecast sales and purchases to hedge, but agrees an appropriate percentage on an individual basis with each business by reference to the groups risk management policies and prevailing market conditions.
The group documents currency derivatives used to hedge its forecast transactions as cash flow hedges.
To the extent that cash flow hedges are effective, gains and losses are deferred in equity until the forecast transaction occurs, at which point the gains and losses are recycled either to the income statement or to the non-financial asset acquired.
The majority of the groups currency derivatives have original maturities of less than one year.
The groups most significant currency transaction exposures are: t sugar prices in British Sugar UK to movements in the sterling euro exchange rate: t sugar prices in Illovo to movements in the South African rand US dollar euro exchange rates: and t sourcing for Primark costs are denominated in a number of currencies, predominantly sterling, euros and US dollars.
Elsewhere, a number of businesses make sales and purchase a variety of raw materials in foreign currencies primarily US dollars and euros, giving rise to transaction exposures.
In all other material respects, businesses tend to operate in their functional currencies and, as a result, further transaction exposure to foreign currency exchange rate movements is modest.

Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The following sensitivity analysis illustrates the impact that a 10% strengthening of the groups operating currencies against local functional currencies would have had on profit and equity.
The analysis covers currency translation exposures at year end on businesses financial assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currencies of those businesses.
A similar but opposite impact would be felt on both profit and equity if the groups main operating currencies weakened against local functional currencies by a similar amount.
The exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on translating the financial statements of subsidiaries into sterling is not included in this sensitivity analysis, as there is no impact on the income statement, and the gains and losses are recorded directly in the translation reserve in equity see below for a separate sensitivity.
This sensitivity is presented before taxation and non-controlling interests.

The groups businesses are exposed to counterparty credit risk when dealing with customers, and from certain financing activities.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a net positive fair value by counterparty at 17 September 2011.
The group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be: 2011 2010 m m Cash and cash equivalents 341 345 Loans and receivables refer to note 24a 1,297 1,139 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss derivative assets 5 7 Designated cash flow hedging relationships derivative assets 21 26 1,664 1,517 The majority of cash balances and short-term deposits are held with strong investment-grade banks or financial institutions.
As at 17 September 2011, there were no significant financial guarantees or third-party obligations that increased the credit risk of the financial assets set out above.
The group uses market knowledge, changes in credit ratings and other techniques to identify significant changes to the financial profile of its counterparties.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 101 24.
Financial instruments continued Trade and other receivables Concentrations of credit risk are limited as a result of the groups large and diverse customer base.
The group has an established credit policy applied by each business under which the credit status of each new customer is reviewed before credit is advanced.
This includes external credit evaluations where possible and in some cases bank references.
Credit limits are established for all significant or high-risk customers, which represent the maximum amount permitted to be outstanding without requiring additional approval from the appropriate level of management.
Outstanding debts are continually monitored by each business.
Credit limits are reviewed on a regular basis, and at least annually.
Customers that fail to meet the groups benchmark creditworthiness may only transact with the group on a prepayment basis.
Aggregate exposures are monitored at group level.
Many of the groups customers have been transacting with the group for many years and the incidence of bad debts has been low.
Where appropriate, goods are sold subject to retention of title so that, in the event of non-payment, the group may have a secured claim.
The group does not typically require collateral in respect of trade and other receivables.
The group provides for impairment of financial assets including trade and other receivables based on known events, and makes a collective provision for losses yet to be identified, based on historical data.
The majority of the provision comprises specific amounts.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade and other receivables at the reporting date by geographic region of origin was: 2011 2010 m m UK 379 315 Europe & Africa 209 189 The Americas 132 129 Asia Pacific 374 315 1,094 948 Trade receivables can be analysed as follows: 2011 2010 gross gross m m Not overdue 821 716 Up to 1 month past due 92 94 Between 1 and 2 months past due 21 20 Between 2 and 3 months past due 9 10 More than 3 months past due 34 33 Provision for doubtful debts 38 38 At 17 September 2011 939 835 Based on past experience, the group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables that are not pastdue.
Trade and other receivables are stated net of the following provision for irrecoverable amounts: 2011 2010 m m Opening balance 38 38 Amounts provided for during the year 10 9 Amounts released during the year 5 2 Amounts utilised during the year 5 8 Effect of movements in foreign exchange 1 Closing balance 38 38 No trade and other receivables 2010 none were written off directly to the income statement in the year.
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Banking relationships are generally limited to those banks that are members of the core relationship group.
These banks are selected for their credit status, global reach and their ability to meet the businesses day-to-day banking requirements.
The credit ratings of these institutions are monitored on a continuing basis.
In locations where the core relationship banking group cannot be used, operating procedures including choice of bank, opening of bank accounts and repatriation of funds must be agreed with group Treasury.
The group has not recorded impairments against cash or cash equivalents, nor have any recoverability issues been identified with such balances.
Such items are typically recoverable on demand or in line with normal banking arrangements.
Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial statements 102 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued for the 52 weeks ended 17 September 2011 24.
Financial instruments continued Other financial assets Other non-current investments are typically equity investments with no fixed maturity or recoverability date.
No impairment issues have been identified with respect to other non-current investments.
Since derivative assets are recorded at fair value, either through profit and loss for those not in a designated cash flow hedging relationship, or otherwise through the hedging reserve, no impairment issues have been identified.
h Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the group will encounter difficulty in meeting its obligations associated with its financial liabilities as they fall due.
Group Treasury is responsible for monitoring and managing liquidity and ensures that the group has sufficient headroom in its committed facilities to meet unforeseen or abnormal requirements.
The group also has access to uncommitted facilities to assist with short-term funding requirements.
Available headroom is monitored via the use of detailed cash flow forecasts prepared by each business, which are reviewed at least quarterly, or more often, as required.
Actual results are compared to budget and forecast each period, and variances investigated and explained.
Particular focus is given to management of working capital.
Details of the groups borrowing facilities are given in section i.
The following table analyses the contractual undiscounted cash flows relating to financial liabilities at the balance sheet date and compares them to carrying amounts: 2011 Due Due Due between between between Due within 6 months 1 and 2 2 and 5 Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year years years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade and other payables 18 1,383 27 1,410 1,410 Secured redeemable debenture stock 17 5 8 166 179 150 Secured bank loans 17 11 26 68 85 36 226 226 Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 17 625 92 119 377 151 1,364 1,238 Finance leases 25 1 1 2 39 43 12 Provisions 19 26 5 103 7 141 136 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Currency derivatives net payments 11 5 16 14 Commodity derivatives net payments 17 7 24 8 TOTAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 2,079 170 457 471 226 3,403 3,194 2010 Due Due Due between between between Due within 6 months 1 and 2 2 and 5 Due after Contracted Carrying 6 months and 1 year years years 5 years amount amount Note m m m m m m m NON-DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trade and other payables 18 1,240 44 1,284 1,284 Secured redeemable debenture stock 17 5 8 16 166 195 150 Secured bank loans 17 38 33 52 21 144 140 Unsecured bank loans and overdrafts 17 253 61 56 406 242 1,018 859 Finance leases 25 1 1 2 40 44 12 Provisions 19 51 48 17 90 14 220 205 DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Currency derivatives net payments 28 4 32 29 Commodity derivatives net payments 4 6 2 9 TOTAL FINANCIAL LIABILITIES 1,620 192 142 685 296 2,935 2,688 The above tables do not include forecast data for liabilities which may be incurred in the future but which were not contracted at 17September 2011.
The principal reasons for differences between carrying values and contractual undiscounted cash flows are coupon payments on the secured redeemable debenture stock and other fixed rate debt to which the group is already committed, future interest payments on the groups finance leases, and cash flows on derivative financial instruments which are not aligned with their fair value.

The group also has 12m of finance lease liabilities which are not included in the tables above, but which are included in the groups loans and overdrafts in note 17.
The 1.15bn syndicated facility matures in July 2015.
In addition to the bank debt, the Company has 394m of private placement notes in issue to institutional investors in the US and Europe.
At 17 September 2011, these had an average remaining duration of 4.2 years and an average fixed coupon of 7.1%.
The other significant core committed debt facilities comprise a 150m debenture loan maturing 2013, 120m EIB loan maturing 2015, as well as local committed facilities in Illovo and Azucarera.
Uncommitted bank borrowing facilities are normally reaffirmed by the banks annually, although they can theoretically be withdrawn at anytime.

Financial instruments continued j Capital management The capital structure of the group is presented in the balance sheet.
The statement of changes in equity provides details on equity and note 17 provides details of loans and overdrafts.
Short and medium-term funding requirements are provided by a variety of loan and overdraft facilities, both committed and uncommitted, with a range of counterparties and maturities.
Longer term funding is sourced from a combination of these facilities, the private placement notes and committed syndicated loan facilities.
The boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to enable successful future development of the business.
The board monitors return on capital by division and determines the overall level of dividends payable to shareholders.
From time to time the trustee of the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust purchases the Companys shares in the market to satisfy awards under the groups share option scheme and long-term incentive plan.
Once purchased, shares are not sold back into the market.
The group does not have a defined share buy-back plan.
There were no changes to the groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
Lease commitments Operating leases The group acts as a lessee, lessor and sub-lessor both for land and buildings, and plant and machinery, under operating leases.
Sublease receipts of 3m 2010 3m were recognised in the income statement in the period, the majority relating to operating leases.
The total of future minimum sublease receipts expected to be received is 53m 2010 35m.
Under the terms of the lease agreements, no contingent rents are payable.
The future minimum lease payments under operating leases are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Within one year 136 113 Between one and five years 539 394 After five years 1,843 1,391 2,518 1,898 Finance leases Finance lease liabilities are payable as follows: 2011 2010 minimum minimum lease 2011 2011 lease 2010 2010 payments interest principal payments interest principal m m m m m m Within one year 11 11 Between one and five years 321 321 After five years 39 28 11 40 29 11 43 31 12 44 32 12 Associated British Foods Annual Report and Accounts 2011 105 26.
Contingencies Litigation and other proceedings against companies in the group are not considered material in the context of these financial statements.
The group has adopted the amendments to IAS 39 in relation to financial guarantee contracts which apply for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2006.
Where group companies enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other group companies, the group considers these to be insurance arrangements and has elected to account for them as such in accordance with IFRS4.
In this respect, the guarantee contract is treated as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the relevant group company issuing the guarantee will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
As at 17 September 2011, group companies have provided guarantees in the ordinary course of business amounting to 645m 2010 403m.
Related parties The group has a controlling related party relationship with its parent company, which is also its ultimate parent company see note 28.
