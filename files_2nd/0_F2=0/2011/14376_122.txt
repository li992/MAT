Accounts and other information 15.6 Finance leases Accounting policy Leases are classied as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classied as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly.
The capital element of future lease payments is included in borrowings and interest is charged to profit before taxation on a reducing balance basis over the term of the lease.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases together with the present value of the minimum lease payments are as follows: 2011 2010 $ million $ million Within one year 5 4 After one and within two years 3 4 After two and within three years 3 3 After three and within four years 3 3 After four and within five years 3 3 After five years 9 12 Total minimum lease payments 25 30 Discounted by imputed interest 7 8 Present value of minimum lease payments 18 22 Present value of minimum lease payments can be split out as: $3m 2010 $4m due within one year, $7m 2010 $8m due between one to five years and $8m 2010 $10m due after five years.
16 Financial instruments and risk management Accounting policy Derivative Financial Instruments Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments and includes counterparty credit risk.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash ow hedges of forecast third party and intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised.
Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year-end.
Changes in the fair values of currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in value of the related net assets.
Interest rate swaps transacted to x interest rates on oating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash ow hedges and changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income costs as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained there until the forecast transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to the income statement for the period.
16.1 Foreign exchange exposures The Group operates in over 90 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure.
The Groups policy is to limit the impact of foreign exchange movements on equity by holding liabilities where practical in the same currencies as the Groups non US Dollar assets.
These liabilities take the form of either borrowings or currency swaps.
The Group designates a portion of foreign currency borrowings in non-operating units as net investment hedges.
As at 31 December 2011, CHF32m 2010 CHF125m of Group borrowings were designated as net investment hedges: the movement in the fair value of these hedges attributable to changes in exchange rates is recognised directly in reserves.
The fair value of these hedges at 31 December 2011 was $34m 2010 $134m.
It is Group policy for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
107 Smith & Nephew Annual Report 2011 Accounts and other information Corporate Governance Business Review Strategy, KPIs & Risk management Overview Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways.
Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale.
The principal transactional exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash ow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash ows for forecast foreign currency inventory purchases for up to one year.
When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure.
Cash ows relating to cash ow hedges are expected to occur within twelve months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to enter into the determination of profit within cost of goods sold within a further twelve month period.
The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent of $940m 2010 $944m.
Based on the Groups borrowings as at 31 December 2011, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 10%, the Groups net borrowings would increase by $11m 2010 $24m.
In respect of borrowings held in a different currency to the relevant reporting entity, if the USDollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, the Groups borrowings would increase by $16m 2010 $35m.
Excluding borrowings designated as net investment hedges, the increase would be $13m 2010 $21m : this increase would be fully offset by corresponding movements in group loan values.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2011 would have been $17m lower 2010 $20m, which would be recognised through the hedging reserve.
Similarly, if the Euro were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2011 would have been $24mhigher 2010 $19m.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2011 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
Since it is the Groups policy to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash ow hedges, the net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant.
16.2 Interest rate exposures The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and currency swaps which are all at oating rates.
The Group uses oating to xed interest swaps to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board.
Interest rate swaps are accounted for as cash ow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income, with the fair value of the interest rate swaps recorded in the balance sheet.
The cash ows resulting from interest rate swaps match cash ows on the underlying borrowings so that there is no net cash ow from movements in market interest rates on the hedged items.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had no interest rate swaps, at 31December 2010 interest rates had been xed on borrowings totalling $98m for a period of six months and $112m for a period of one year.
Based on the Groups gross borrowings as at 31 December 2011, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the annual net interest charge would increase by $4m 2010 $5m.
Excluding the impact of the Groups interest rate hedges, the increase in the interest charge would be $4m 2010 $7m.
A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits which, with certain minor exceptions due to local market conditions, require counterparties to have a minimum A rating from one of the major ratings agencies.
The financial exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2011 was $21m 2010 $23m, being the total debit fair values on forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
The maximum credit risk exposure on cash and bank at 31 December 2011 was $184m 2010 $207m.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

In 2011, the Group also had liabilities due for deferred acquisition consideration denominated in US Dollars, Euro and Yen totalling $11m 2010 $nil, 2009 $46m on which no interest was payable see Note 14.
There are no other significant interest bearing financial liabilities.
Floating rates on liabilities are typically based on the one or three-month LIBOR interest rate relevant to the currency concerned.
The weighted average interest rate on oating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2011 was 2% 2010 1%.

16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three months the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are recorded at fair value.
These are regarded as Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value.
Level 2 financial investments are dened as: Valuation techniques for which all observable inputs have a significant effect on the recorded fair values, either directly or indirectly.
The Group only has Level 2 financial instruments measured at fair value.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.
Derivatives valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs are mainly interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.
The models incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves.
