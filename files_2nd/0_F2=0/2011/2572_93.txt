FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23.
Retirement benefit plans Background The group has both dened benefit and dened contribution retirement benefit plans.
The groups main plans are in the UK.
The BTPS is a dened benefit plan which has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001.
Subsequent to that date new entrants have been able to join a dened contribution plan, initially the BT Retirement Plan BTRP and since 1 April 2009 the BT Retirement Saving Scheme BTRSS, a contract-based dened contribution arrangement, to which BTRP members were invited to transfer their accumulated assets.
A dened contribution plan is a pension arrangement under which both the company and participating members pay xed contributions to an independently administered fund.
Pension benets for members of the plan are linked to contributions paid, the performance of each individuals chosen investments and the annuity rates at retirement.
The income statement charge in respect of dened contribution plans represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The company has no exposure to investment and other experience risks.
A dened benefit plan is a pension arrangement under which participating members receive a pension benefit at retirement dependent on factors such as age, years of service and pensionable pay.
Benets are determined by the scheme rules and are not dependent upon actual contributions made by the company or members.
The plan is administered by an independent trustee who is responsible for ensuring that the plan is sufciently funded to meet current and future benefit payments and therefore must agree with the sponsoring company a funding plan for additional company contributions where it is estimated that the benets will not be met from regular contributions and expected investment returns.
The company is exposed to investment and other experience risks.
The membership of the BTPS is shown below: 2011 2010 Number Number At 31 March of members of members Active members 51,000 55,000 Deferred members 88,500 93,000 Pensioners 188,000 185,000 Total membership 327,500 333,000 Since 1 April 2009, active BTPS members accrue benets based upon a career average revalued earnings CARE basis and a normal pensionable age of 65.
Pensionable service prior to that date entitles scheme members to benets based upon their final salary and a normal pensionable age of 60.
On a CARE basis, rather than being based upon final salary, benets are built up based upon earnings in each year and the benefit accrued for each year is increased by the lower of ination or the individuals actual pay increase in each year to retirement.
Under the scheme rules, pension benets are increased in line with ination see below for details.
BT Pension Scheme Trustees Limited the Trustee administers and manages the scheme on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed of the scheme and relevant legislation.
Under the terms of the Trust Deed of the BTPS, there are nine Trustee directors appointed by the group, five of which appointments are made with the agreement of the relevant trade unions, including the Chairman of the Trustee.
Four Trustee directors, other than the Chairman, are appointed by BT on the nomination of the relevant trade unions.
Two of the Trustee directors will normally hold senior positions within the group, and two will normally hold or have held senior positions in commerce or industry.
Subject to there being an appropriately qualied candidate, there should be at least one current pensioner or deferred pensioner of the BTPS as one of the Trustee directors.
Trustee directors are appointed for a three-year term, but are then eligible for re-appointment.
Further details of the governance of the BTPS, its financial position and performance of investments, and a summary of member benets are available in the BTPS Annual Report published by the Trustee in June each year.

Retirement benefit plans continued The current service cost that will be recognised in the income statement in 2012 relating to dened benefit plans is estimated to be around 25m lower than in 2011, derived from market conditions at 1 April 2011.
The net interest income, within specic items, is estimated to be around 200m in 2012, an improvement of around 280m.
Subsequent changes in market conditions during 2012 will be reected as actuarial gains or losses in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
6m 2010: 6m, 2009: 4m of contributions to dened contribution plans were outstanding at 31 March 2011.

However, the scheme held 10m 2010: 52m of bonds and 7m 2010: 6m of indexlinked bonds issued by the group.
The group occupies two 2010: four properties owned by the BTPS on which an annual rental of 0.1m is payable 2010: 0.2m.
Expected long-term return on assets IAS 19 The expected long-term rate of return on assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets reported in the income statement as a specic item.
The expected returns on xed-interest and index-linked securities are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year which assume that the security is held to maturity.
Expected returns on equities, property and alternative asset classes are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above yields on government bonds, consensus economic forecasts of future returns and historical returns.

Retirement benefit plans continued Asset allocation The target allocation of assets between different classes of investment is reviewed regularly and is a key factor in the Trustees investment policy.
The Trustees main investment objective is to ensure that over the long-term, and after allowing for all future income, the BTPS will have sufficient liquid resources to meet the cost of benefit payments as they fall due.
The targets set reect the Trustees views on the appropriate balance to be struck between seeking returns and incurring risk, and on the extent to which the assets should be distributed to match liabilities.
The targets are a long-term aim to be achieved over a period as and when favourable opportunities arise.
Current market conditions and trends are continuously assessed and short-term tactical shifts in asset allocation may be made around the long-term target, for example, by using stock index future contracts.
The BTPS also uses financial instruments to manage interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Trustee reports on investment performance against a target benchmark which is based on the target asset mix and the market returns for each asset class.
BTPS performance against the benchmark for the periods to 31 December 2010 was as follows: Target Actual Over under benchmark BTPS performance return return return Period ending 31 December 2010 %%% 1 year 10.7 11.8 1.1 3 years 0.2 1.1 1.3 10 years 4.1 5.1 1.0 Further commentary on investment performance is provided in the Report by the Trustee in the BTPS Annual Report.
Measurement of scheme liabilities IAS 19 The liabilities of the BTPS are measured as the present value of the best estimate of future cash ows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of scheme liabilities is calculated by estimating future benefit payments, including allowance for benets to increase with ination and projected salary levels, and discounting the resulting cash ows.
Principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The estimated average duration of BTPS liabilities is 15 years 2010: 15 years and the benets payable by the BTPS are expected to be paid over more than 60 years as shown in the following graph: Forecast benets payable by the BTPS at 31 March 2011 m 3,000 2,500 2,000 1,500 1,000 500 0 2012 2035 2058 2081 2104 The expected future benefit payments are based on a number of assumptions including future ination, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Sensitivities are set out below.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take more or less cash lump sum at retirement.
The rate of ination inuences the assumptions for salary and pension increases.
In assessing the appropriate assumption for pension increases, management have considered the announcement in July 2010 by the UK Government that the Consumer Prices Index CPI, rather than the Retail Prices Index RPI, will be used as the basis for determining the rate of ination for the statutory minimum rate of revaluation and indexation of occupational pension rights.
Under the scheme rules the Governments decision has the following impact with effect for increases after 1 April 2011: members who commenced employment prior to 1 April 1986 CPI will be used to revalue preserved pensions of deferred members and for the rate of inationary increase applied to pensions in payment members who commenced employment on or after 1 April 1986 CPI will be used to revalue preserved pensions of deferred members and RPI will continue to be used for inationary increases to pensions in payment.
The Governments decision does not affect the accrual of benets for employees while they are active members of the scheme for whom benets accrue on a CARE basis that is linked to RPI.
BT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FORM 20-F 2011 131 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23.
Retirement benefit plans continued The assumption for RPI has been assessed by reference to yields on long-term xed interest and index-linked Government bonds and has regard to Bank of England published inationary expectations.
CPI is assessed at a margin below RPI taking into account long-term trends.
The impact of using CPI instead of RPI is to reduce BTPS liabilities at 31 March 2011 by 3.5bn.
In determining the most appropriate manner by which to reect the impact of the change on the scheme liabilities, the directors have had regard to the UITF Abstract 48 Accounting implications of the replacement of the Retail Prices Index with the Consumer Prices Index for retirement benets issued by the Urgent Issues Task Force of the UK Accounting Standards Board in December 2010.
The Abstract states that, where the obligation is to pay pensions with increases based on a general measure of ination rather than a measure linked specically to RPI, a change in the ination assumption represents an actuarial gain or loss rather than a cost relating to past service of employees.
Accordingly, the gain on re-measurement of the liabilities of the BTPS to reect CPI as the ination measure is recorded as an actuarial gain in comprehensive income in 2011.
The key financial assumptions used to measure the liabilities of the BTPS under IAS 19 at 31 March 2011 are as follows: Nominal rates per annum Real rates per annum 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 At 31 March %%%%%% Rate used to discount liabilities 5.50 5.50 6.85 2.03 1.83 3.84 Ination increase in RPI 3.40 3.60 2.90 n a n a n a a Ination increase in CPI 2.40 n a n a n a n a n a Average future increases in wages and salaries 3.40 3.60 2.90 a There is a short-term reduction in CPI of 0.5% for one year.
IAS 19 requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at the reporting date on high quality corporate bonds.
The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency and estimated term of the pension obligations.
The discount rate has been assessed by reference to the duration of the BTPSs liabilities and by reference to the published iBoxx index of Sterling corporate bonds of duration greater than 15 years and investment grade AA and above.
Allowance is made where the constituent bonds in the published index have been re-rated or new issues made.
The nominal rate is used to discount the future expected benefit payments.
The real rate is shown as a comparator to ination.
The average life expectancy assumptions, after retirement at 60 years of age, are as follows: 2011 2010 Number of Number of At 31 March years years Male in lower pay bracket 25.3 25.2 Male in higher pay bracket 27.6 27.4 Female 28.2 28.1 Average improvement for a member retiring at age 60 in 10 years time 1.1 1.1 The assumptions about life expectancy have regard to information published by the UK actuarial professions Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau.
However, due to the size of the membership of the BTPS it is considered appropriate for the life expectancy assumptions adopted to take into account the actual membership experience.
Allowance is also made for future improvements in mortality.
The BTPS actuary undertakes formal reviews of the membership experience every three years.
The IAS 19 life expectancy assumptions reect the 2008 triennial funding valuation basis.
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure BTPS liabilities The assumed discount rate, ination, salary increases and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement of scheme liabilities.
The following table shows the sensitivity of the valuation of the pension liability, and of the estimated income statement charge for 2012, to changes in these assumptions: Decrease Decrease Decrease increase in increase in increase in net finance liability service cost income bn m m 0.25 percentage point increase to: discount rate 1.4 15 ination rate RPI 0.5 15 45 salary increases 0.2 5 15 Additional one year increase to life expectancy 1.0 5 55 0.1 percentage point increase in expected return on assets 35 132 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23.

This includes both financial assumptions, which are based on market conditions at the year end, and non-financial assumptions such as life expectancy.
BT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FORM 20-F 2011 133 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23.
Retirement benefit plans continued Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustments on dened benefit liabilities represents the impact on the liabilities of differences between actual experience during the year compared to the assumptions made.
Such differences might arise, for example, from actual salary increases being different from those assumed, or members choosing different benefit options at retirement.
Actuarial gain loss arising from experience adjustment on plan assets represents the difference between the actual investment performance in the year and expected rate of return on assets assumed at the start of the year.
BTPS funding valuation and future funding obligations A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent Trustee by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit credit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that the scheme has sufficient funds available to meet future benefit payments.
The funding valuation is based on prudent assumptions and is performed at 31 December as this is the financial year end of the scheme.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted to their present value.
The last two triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Nominal rates per annum Real rates per annum 2008 2005 2008 2005 valuation valuation valuation valuation %%%% Discount rate Pre retirement liabilities 6.76 5.84 3.65 3.06 Post retirement liabilities 5.21 4.54 2.15 1.79 Average long-term increase in retail price index 3.00 2.70 Average future increases in wages and salaries 3.00 3.47 0.75 Average increase in pensions 3.00 2.70 The results of the two most recent triennial valuations based upon these prudent actuarial assumptions were: 2008 2005 valuation valuation At 31 December bn bn BTPS liabilities 40.2 37.8 Market value of BTPS assets 31.2 34.4 Funding deficit 9.0 3.4 Percentage of accrued benets covered by BTPS assets at valuation date 77.6% 90.9% Percentage of members benets that the BTPS assets could purchase from an insurance company at the valuation date 57.0% 70.0% In the three years ended 31 December 2008, the decline in the market value of assets combined with longer life expectancy assumptions signicantly increased the funding deficit, although the impact on the liabilities was reduced by the higher discount rate and favourable experience compared to other actuarial assumptions used at 31 December 2005.
The outcome of the 2008 valuation was announced in February 2010, together with the agreement between BT and the Trustee of the BTPS to a recovery plan to make good the 9.0bn funding deficit over 17 years.
The agreement also determined that the ordinary contributions rate required to meet the benets of current employed members for service after the valuation date reduce to 13.6% of pensionable salaries including employee contributions from 19.5%, reecting the implementation of benefit changes with effect from 1 April 2009.
The group made the first two payments of 525m each in December 2009 and 2010, respectively, under the 17-year recovery plan and in March 2011 paid 505m representing the actuarial value of the 525m payment due to have been made in December 2011.
The remaining payments are scheduled to be paid as follows: Year ended 31 December m 2011 2012 583 2013-25 Increasing at 3% pa 134 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 23.
Retirement benefit plans continued Under the terms of the Trust Deed that governs the BTPS, the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years.
Other features of the February 2010 legal agreements with the Trustee for BT providing support to the scheme are: in the event that cumulative shareholder distributions exceed cumulative total pension contributions over the three-year period to 31 December 2011, then BT will make additional matching contributions to the scheme.
in the event that BT generates net cash proceeds greater than 1bn from disposals and acquisitions in any 12-month period to 31 December 2011 then BT will make additional contributions to the scheme equal to one third of those net cash proceeds.
a negative pledge that provides comfort to the scheme that future creditors will not be granted superior security to the scheme in excess of a 1.5bn threshold.
Since the valuation date the schemes assets have increased by 5.8bn and the Trustees initial estimate is that if the funding valuation was performed using the same methodology at 31 December 2010 the deficit would have been around 3.2bn on this prudent valuation basis, after allowing for the 0.5bn deficit payment made in March 2011.
The Pensions Regulators review of the 2008 BTPS funding valuation and recovery plan is now on hold and not expected to recommence until the outcome of the final Court decision, including any potential appeals, is known on the Crown Guarantee.
We do not expect this to be before the completion of the next triennial funding valuation as at 31 December 2011.
As is usual, BT and the Trustee will engage with the Pensions Regulator regarding the 2011 valuation.
Payments made to the BTPS 2011 2010 Year ended 31 March m m Ordinary contributions 266 384 deficit contributions 1,030 525 Total contributions in the year 1,296 909 The group expects to contribute approximately 135m to the BTPS in 2012, being ordinary contributions only, as the deficit payment due in December 2011 was paid early in March 2011.
The expected payments are reduced by 110m to recover overpayments of ordinary contributions paid in 2010 before the reduced rate of regular contributions was announced in February 2010.
Other protection of BTPS member benets If the group were to become insolvent there are additional protections available to members: the Crown Guarantee which was granted when the group was privatised in 1984 and applies upon the winding up of the group.
The scope and extent of the Crown Guarantee is being claried by the Trustee through the courts.
The decision of the High Court issued in October 2010 was that the Crown Guarantee is not limited to those who were members of the scheme at the date of privatisation and that members who joined after privatisation are also capable of being covered.
The Court confirmed that any payments to be made by the Government must be measured on an annuity basis.
It was decided that the Crown Guarantee does not cover the benets of members accrued while in service with companies that participate in the BTPS other than BT if the member concerned had not previously been employed by BT.
The judgment was the first stage in the case and leaves further issues to be considered at future hearings and or appeals.
Until these issues are nally resolved it is not possible to say with complete precision what the scope of the Crown Guarantee is.
the Pension Protection Fund PPF may take over the scheme and pay benets to members not covered by the Crown Guarantee.
There are limits on the amounts paid by the PPF and this would not give exactly the same benets as those provided by the scheme.
