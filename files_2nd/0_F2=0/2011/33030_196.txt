Segmental analysis The groups organizational structure reects the various activities in which BP is engaged.
In 2011, BP had two reportable segments: Exploration and Production and Rening and Marketing.
BPs activities in low-carbon energy are managed through our Alternative Energy business, which is reported in Other businesses and corporate.
The group is managed on an integrated basis.
Exploration and Productions activities include oil and natural gas exploration, eld development and production: midstream transportation, storage and processing: and the marketing and trading of natural gas, including liqueed natural gas LNG, together with power and natural gas liquids NGLs.
At the end of 2010, BP announced its decision to reorganize its Exploration and Production segment to create three functional divisions Exploration, Developments and Production, integrated through a Strategy and Integration organization.
This structure was established in March 2011 but this has not affected the groups reportable segments and Exploration and Production continues to be reported as a single operating segment.
From 1 January 2012, the groups investment in TNK-BP will be reported as a separate operating segment, rather than within the Exploration and Production segment, reecting the way in which the investment is now managed.
Rening and Marketings activities include the rening, manufacturing, marketing, transportation, and supply and trading of crude oil, petroleum, petrochemicals products and related services to wholesale and retail customers.
Other businesses and corporate comprises the Alternative Energy business, Shipping, Treasury which in the segmental analysis includes all of the groups cash, cash equivalents and associated interest income, and corporate activities worldwide.
It also included the groups aluminium business until its disposal during 2011.
The Alternative Energy business is an operating segment that has been aggregated with the other activities within Other businesses and corporate as it does not meet the materiality thresholds for separate segment reporting.
In 2010, following the Gulf of Mexico incident, we established the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization GCRO and equipped it with dedicated resources and capabilities to manage all aspects of our response to the incident.
This organization reports directly to the group chief executive and is overseen by a board committee, however it is not an operating segment.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as the groups accounting policies described in Note 1.
However, IFRS requires that the measure of profit or loss disclosed for each operating segment is the measure that is provided regularly to the chief operating decision maker for the purposes of performance assessment and resource allocation.
For BP, this measure of profit or loss is replacement cost profit or loss before interest a and tax which reects the replacement cost of supplies by excluding from profit or loss inventory holding gains and losses.
Replacement cost profit or loss for the group is not a recognized GAAP measure.
Sales between segments are made at prices that approximate market prices, taking into account the volumes involved.
Segment revenues and segment results include transactions between business segments.
These transactions and any unrealized profits and losses are eliminated on consolidation, unless unrealized losses provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Sales to external customers by region are based on the location of the seller.
The UK region includes the UK-based international activities of Rening and Marketing.
All surpluses and deficits recognized on the group balance sheet in respect of pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are allocated to Other businesses and corporate.
However, the periodic expense relating to these plans is allocated to the other operating segments based upon the business in which the employees work.
Certain financial information is provided separately for the US as this is an individually material country for BP, and for the UK as this is BPs country of domicile.
a Inventory holding gains and losses represent the difference between the cost of sales calculated using the average cost to BP of supplies acquired during the period and the cost of sales calculated on the first-in first-out FIFO method after adjusting for any changes in provisions where the net realizable value of the inventory is lower than its cost.
Under the FIFO method, which we use for IFRS reporting, the cost of inventory charged to the income statement is based on its historic cost of purchase, or manufacture, rather than its replacement cost.
In volatile energy markets, this can have a significant distorting effect on reported income.
The amounts disclosed represent the difference between the charge to the income statement for inventory on a FIFO basis after adjusting for any related movements in net realizable value provisions and the charge that would have arisen if an average cost of supplies was used for the period.
For this purpose, the average cost of supplies during the period is principally calculated on a monthly basis by dividing the total cost of inventory acquired in the period by the number of barrels acquired.
The amounts disclosed are not separately reected in the financial statements as a gain or loss.
No adjustment is made in respect of the cost of inventories held as part of a trading position and certain other temporary inventory positions.
