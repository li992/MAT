Franchise value represents the excess cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business at the date of acquisition.
The cost of an acquisition of a business is the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred at the date of acquisition.
Franchise value is carried in the Statement of Financial Position at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Franchise value has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable, based on a valuation prepared on the basis of managements judgements regarding the future prospects for the business, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates.
Acquisition of GLG On 14 October 2010, Man acquired GLG the Acquisition, which then became a wholly owned subsidiary of Man.
The Acquisition was structured as a cash acquisition with respect to the GLG Public Shareholders and a share exchange in respect of the GLG Principals and key employees.
The cash consideration for the Public Shareholders was around $1.0 billion, which was funded from existing cash resources.
The GLG Principals and key employees were granted in aggregate 162,732,446 newly issued shares of Man in exchange for their shares in GLG.
The shares issued are subject to sale restrictions of between two and three years and, in some cases, service vesting conditions.
66 Man Group plc Annual Report 2011 Financial Review continued 13.
Franchise value goodwill and other intangible assets continued Man engaged external valuation specialists to advise on the allocation of the purchase price between franchise value, intangible assets and net tangible assets.
Provisional values for the acquired business, at the date of acquisition, are set out in the table below: Book Fair value Provisional $m Provisional value adjustment Fair value Cash and cash equivalents 206 206 Fee and other receivables 110 4 114 Investments in fund products 29 29 Leasehold improvements and equipment 7 7 Franchise value and other intangible assets 34 640 674 Trade and other payables 202 88 290 Borrowings 484 99 583 Deferred tax arising on other intangible assets 141 141 Net assets acquired 300 316 16 Repurchase of convertible notes 297 Franchise value arising on acquisition 1,403 1,716 Purchase consideration: Cash consideration 997 Value of shares issued 628 Share replacement schemes, net of deferred tax 91 1,716 The fair value adjustment relating to other intangible assets above relates to the valuation of investment management contracts IMCs of GLG $596 million along with other intangibles such as the GLG brand name $34 million and distribution channel $42 million as well as other assets of $2 million.
The fair value adjustments to trade and other payables primarily relates to compensation accruals on un-crystallised performance fee income at the date of the acquisition.
This accrual was crystallised in December 2010 when the performance fees were realised.
The remaining adjustment relates to the fair value of the GLG premises lease and other liabilities.
The fair value adjustment to borrowings relates to the convertible debt and term loan, which were both repaid soon after the acquisition.
Deferred tax has been provided on the value of the intangible assets, and this is a non-cash item as the liability arises due to the tax non-deductibility of the amortisation of IMCs.
The share replacement schemes component of purchase consideration relates to the fair value of new Man share awards issued on acquisition date to replace pre-existing GLG employee share awards AFI 14.
The franchise value primarily represents the significant revenue synergies to be generated from acquiring and integrating the GLG businesses with Man together with cost synergies from combining the two operating platforms.
Man has the potential to add significant incremental FUM through combining GLGs investment offering with Mans structuring and distribution expertise.
The franchise value is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The post tax result for the period since the acquisition date for GLG alone amounted to a profit of $11 million, excluding pre-tax items in relation to post-acquisition amortisation of purchased intangibles of $28 million, a charge of $17 million for restructuring costs included within adjusting items and an acquisition balance sheet fair value adjustment relating to compensation of $54 million.
If the Acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the loss after tax of GLG would have been $36 million, excluding amortisation of purchased intangibles of $60 million and a charge of $17 million for restructuring costs included within adjusting items.
This result does not include any benefit from cost or revenue synergies.
Revenue for the period since the acquisition date for GLG amounted to $255 million, and if the Acquisition had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the revenue for GLG would have been $431 million.
Other intangible assets have been recognised in respect of acquired IMCs, the distribution network and the GLG brand value.
These intangible assets are recognised at the present value of the expected future cash flows of the investment management contracts and distribution channels acquired and are amortised on a straight-line basis over the expected life which is provisionally 9 to 12 years, and 10 years for the GLG brand name Note 13.3.
From a capital management perspective all acquisition intangibles, net of deferred taxes, and franchise value is supported with shareholders equity.
This approach is consistent with our regulatory capital treatment.
The acquisition of GLG was supported with existing excess shareholders capital and the issuance of new Man shares to the principals and key employees.
Impairment of Man Multi-Manager MMM In respect of the MMM business, although the business is profitable and making good operational progress, particularly with its managed account based solutions, the key sensitivity in the regular impairment review of this cash generating unit is the outlook for sales.
Mans structured products are now expected primarily to use GLG strategies in place of MMM content, which means that future sales and margins anticipated for the MMM business may be lower than previously expected.
Man Group plc 67 Annual Report 2011 The value of the MMM business has been reassessed at 31 March 2011 by applying a discounted future cash flow model, which reflects lower sales and margin expectations, and by assessing the fair value of the business based on market multiples applied to net fee income.
Both methodologies resulted in a similar valuation.
As a result an impairment of $375 million has been recognised.
This impairment is a non-cash charge and has no impact on the excess regulatory capital position.
The discounted cash flow valuation has been based on the Three Year Plan for the calendar years ended 31 December 2013 which was approved by the Board of Directors, and which factored in expected gross sales growth of 20% per annum, average redemptions of around 14% of FUM, lower fee margins reflecting the sales content mix, average investment performance of 8% and cost estimates.
The discounted cash flows have been modelled for three years to be consistent with the Three Year Plan.
The cash inflows and outflows are then modelled to increase by 2% per annum in perpetuity, as a reasonable approximation of historic US long term growth rates.
This is used due to the low certainty around forecasting over longer time frames.
The risk adjusted discount rate is based on the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital WACC of 11.25%.
If the fair value amount was to fall to below the discounted cash flow valuation, the following sensitivities around the discounted cash flow valuation would result in further impairment.
The individual sensitivities around the key assumptions applied in the discounted cash flow model highlight that the MMM business continues to be dependent on the sales budget and fund performance being achieved and the discount rate applied, as below: If gross sales are $550 million lower than budget for the financial year ending 31 December 2011, the valuation would fall by around $40 million If fund performance is flat in the financial year ending 31 December 2011, instead of the assumed 8% return, the valuation would fall by around $165 million If the discount rate is increased by 1%, the valuation would fall by around $45 million.

The amortisation relating to the GLG Brand name was $2 million and the distribution channels was $2 million.
Placement fees Placement fees are paid to distributors and employees for selling fund products, generally structured products.
The majority of placement fees paid are capitalised as an intangible asset which represents the contractual right to benefit from future income from providing investment management services.
The amortisation period is based on managements estimate of the weighted average period over which Man expects to earn economic benefit from the investor in each product, estimated to be five years.
The carrying value of this intangible asset in the Statement of Financial Position is based on cost less accumulated amortisation, and is amortised on a straight-line basis.
If an investor redeems their investment in a fund product the corresponding unamortised placement fee is written off.
Generally a redemption fee is charged to the investor.
The placement fees intangible is also subject to impairment testing each period to ensure that the future economic benefit arising from each fund product is in excess of the remaining unamortised balance.
Amortisation expense, amounts written off, and any impairment losses, are included in distribution costs in the Income Statement.
At year end the unamortised placement fees were $184 million 2010: $278 million and the amortisation charge for the period was $92 million 2010: $110 million.
The weighted average remaining amortisation period of the unamortised placement fees at 31 March 2011 is two years.
From a capital management perspective we evaluate the risk of the placement fee taking account of the redemption fee payable by the investor on early redemptions.
The risk is that we accelerate the amortisation charge due to poor investment performance.
From a regulatory capital perspective placement fees are an intangible asset and are required to be supported with Tier 1 regulatory capital.
