The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB IFRIC standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation.
Segmental analysis In prior years the Group has been organised into three core divisions, Bus, Rail and Aviation Service, which formed the basis for the Groups reportable segments.
Following the sale of residual ground handling activities at Heathrow Terminal I and Meteor Parking this year, management has reviewed the basis for segment reporting and concluded that there should be four reportable segments, Deregulated Bus, Regulated Bus, Rail and Go-Ahead North America.
Comparative disclosures have been restated to reflect the new basis of segmentation.
Operating segments within those reportable divisions are combined on the basis of their long term characteristics and similar nature of their products and services, as follows: The Deregulated Bus division comprises bus operations outside of London.
The Regulated Bus division comprises bus operations in London.
The Rail operation, Govia, is 65% owned by Go-Ahead and 35% by Keolis and comprises three rail franchises: Southern, Southeastern and London Midland.
The Go-Ahead North America division comprises a 50% investment in a US school bus operation.
The Groups share of the profit of this division is currently nil, and it is therefore not included within the tables below.
The information reported to the Group Chief Executive in his capacity as Chief Operating Decision Maker does not include an analysis of assets and liabilities and accordingly IFRS 8 does not require this information to be presented.
Segment performance is evaluated based on operating profit or loss excluding amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets and exceptional items.
Transfer prices between operating segments are on an arms length basis similar to transactions with third parties.

The brought forward element of the franchise intangible is made up of 17.1m relating to the opening deficit in the RPS and 7.8m relating to the cost of the intangible asset acquired on the handover of the franchise assets relating to the Southeastern rail franchise.
The intangible asset is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the franchises being between five and eight years.
Software costs Software costs capitalised exclude software that is integral to the related hardware.
Customer contracts This relates to the value attributed to customer contracts and relationships purchased as part of the Groups acquisitions.
The value is calculated based on the unexpired term of the contracts at the date of acquisition and is amortised over that period.
Impairment During the year ended 3 July 2010 an impairment review of the aviation services division resulted in the goodwill of Meteor Parking of 18.4m being written down to 2.2m.
During the year ended 2 July 2011, Meteor Parking was sold and therefore there is no goodwill left relating to Meteor Parking at the year end.

Intangible assets continued Goodwill As from 3 July 2004, goodwill is no longer amortised and is tested annually for impairment.
The goodwill charge of nil 2010: 1.1m is in respect of rail businesses which, due to the finite nature of the franchises, require the goodwill to be impaired annually.
Goodwill acquired through acquisitions has been allocated to individual cash-generating units for impairment testing on the basis of the Groups business operations.
The carrying value of goodwill by cash-generating unit is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Meteor Parking 2.2 Metrobus 10.6 10.6 Go South Coast 28.6 28.6 Brighton & Hove 2.1 2.1 Plymouth Citybus 13.0 13.0 Go-Ahead London 10.5 10.5 Go North East 2.7 2.7 Konectbus 3.6 3.6 Thames Travel 2.7 73.8 73.3 The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for each cash-generating unit, using cashflow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period which have then been extended over an appropriate period.
The Directors feel that the extended period is justified because of the long term stability of the relevant income streams.
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the three year forecasts over the extended period plus a terminal value using a growth rate of 2.25%-3.0% which reflects the Directors view of long term growth rates in each business.
The pre-tax cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 11.0% 2010: 11.1%, based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, plus an appropriate risk premium for each cash-generating unit of 0.0-2.0% 2010: 0.0-2.0%.
The calculation of value in use for each cash-generating unit is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the growth rate used to extrapolate cashflows beyond the budget period.
The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, staff costs and general overheads.
These assumptions are influenced by several internal and external factors.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance of each unit and to be realistically achievable in light of economic and industry measures and forecasts.
We have conducted sensitivity analysis on our calculations and confirmed that there is no likely movement on assumptions that would lead to an impairment.
The cash generating unit with the least headroom is Plymouth Citybus, as expected given it has only recently been acquired.
The headroom on Plymouth Citybus is 1.1m.
An increase of 1% of the Groups weighted cost of capital would result in an impairment of less than 1m.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 108 15. Business combinations Year ended 2 July 2011 On 24 May 2011, Go-Ahead Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Thames Travel Wallingford Limited for a cash consideration of 3.5m.
Thames Travel carries around 3 million passengers per year in South Oxfordshire and West Berkshire and generates turnover of around 5.5m.

Receivables have been assessed and are considered to be recoverable.
The goodwill capitalised reflects the access to the markets served by the acquired entities and the potential business synergies that can be achieved upon acquisition.
Management believes that goodwill represents future growth opportunities and created value in respect of customer awareness and an assembled workforce for which the recognition of a discrete intangible asset is not permitted.
From the date of acquisition, in the year ended 2 July 2011, the acquisitions recorded an operating profit of nil to the Group and revenue of 0.5m.
Had the combinations taken place at the beginning of the year, it is estimated that they would have recorded 0.4m of operating profit and 5.5m of revenue to the Group.
This would have resulted in total Group revenue from continuing operations of 2,302.5m, and total operating profit from continuing operations before amortisation and exceptional items of 115.5m.
Year ended 3 July 2010 On 3 October 2009, London General Transport Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of East Thames Buses from Transport for London TfL for a total cash consideration of 5.0m.
East Thames Buses operated a fleet of approximately 120 vehicles over nine TfL contracted routes.
On 3 October 2009, Metrobus Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired the assets of Arrivas bus interest in Horsham for a total cash consideration of 5.0m.
The interests include a fleet of 18 vehicles and 58 employees, and will operate as part of Metrobus Limited which provides bus services in Sussex, Surrey and Kent including regulated services for TfL.
On 1 December 2009, Go-Ahead Holding Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, acquired 100% of the share capital of Plymouth Citybus Limited from Plymouth City Council for a cash consideration of 19.0m.
Plymouth Citybus operates a fleet of 175 vehicles and employs approximately 470 employees in the Plymouth area.
On 9 March 2010, Go-Ahead Holding Limited also acquired 100% of the share capital of Konectbus Limited which operates a bus fleet of 44 vehicles and employs approximately 70 employees in the Norfolk area.
On 28 March 2010, Go North East Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Group, entered into a contract to acquire the Hexham operations of Arriva plc for a cash consideration and agreed to sell Go North Easts Ashington operations to Arriva.
The operations became effective April 2010.
The combined consideration for these acquisitions was 8.2m.

Financial risk management objectives and policies Financial risk factors and management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, a sterling bond, hire purchase and finance lease contracts, and cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide an appropriate level of net debt to fund the Groups activities, namely working capital, fixed asset expenditure, acquisitions, dividends and share buybacks.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps and fuel swaps.
The purpose of these is to manage the interest rate and fuel price risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2010, the Groups policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken and derivatives are only purchased for internal benefit.
The main financial risks arising from the Groups activities are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Risks arising from fuel derivatives are explained in note 24. www.
com 115 Financial Statements FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23.
Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Interest rate risk The Group borrows and deposits funds and is exposed to changes in interest rates.
The Boards policy toward cash deposits is to deposit cash short term on UK money markets.
Interest payable on senior bank borrowings is based on re-fixing the rate of interest over short periods of time of up to 36 months.
During the year the Group has partially managed interest rate risk by hedging.
Excluding fixed rate debt, the Group has net borrowings and hence the present adverse risk is an increase in interest rates.
The maturity and interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 2 July 2011 is as follows: Average Within More than rate 1 year 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years Total % m m m m m m m Year ended 2 July 2011 Floating rate liabilities assets Bank overdrafts 1.50 5.0 5.0 Variable rate loans 1.78 87.9 87.9 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts Interest rate swaps 2.25 52.0 80.0 132.0 Gross floating rate assets liabilities 47.0 80.0 87.9 39.1 Cash assets 0.65 228.6 228.6 Net floating rate assets liabilities 275.6 80.0 87.9 267.7 Fixed rate liabilities 200m Sterling 7.5 year bond 5.38 200.0 200.0 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 4.89 2.4 1.5 0.4 0.5 0.7 5.5 Interest rate swaps 2.25 52.0 80.0 132.0 54.4 81.5 0.4 0.5 0.7 200.0 337.5 Total floating and fixed profile 221.2 1.5 0.4 0.5 88.6 200.0 69.8 Year ended 3 July 2010 Floating rate liabilities assets Bank overdrafts 1.50 5.8 5.8 Variable rate loans 1.01 5.6 103.0 108.6 Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 1.31 0.8 0.8 Interest rate swaps 2.25 53.4 80.0 133.4 Gross floating rate liabilities assets 12.2 53.4 23.0 18.2 Cash assets 0.55 236.1 236.1 Net floating rate assets liabilities 223.9 53.4 23.0 254.3 Fixed rate liabilities 200m Sterling 7.5 year bond 5.38 200.0 200.0 Medium term fixed rate loan Obligations under finance lease and hire purchase contracts 5.68 5.5 2.3 1.0 0.3 0.1 9.2 Interest rate swaps 2.25 53.4 80.0 133.4 5.5 55.7 81.0 0.3 0.1 200.0 342.6 Total floating and fixed profile 218.4 2.3 104.0 0.3 0.1 200.0 88.3 Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is re-priced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest-bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 116 At 2 July 2011, the Group had four interest rate swaps totalling 130.0m.
One of these interest rate swaps fixes the interest on part of the variable rate syndicated loan 50.0m was fixed at 2.39% plus margin until December 2012.
The remaining three interest rate swaps totalling 80.0m are now ineffective.
During the year ended 2 July 2011, these four interest swaps have resulted in a realised loss of 2.1m 2010: 3.0m.
These swaps result in a net fixed rate liability of 2.0m at 2 July 2011 2010: 3.4m liability.
Hence the adverse risk at year end is a decrease in interest rates.

The Groups road passenger vehicles can be financed by hire purchase or finance lease arrangements, or term loans at fixed rates of interest over two to five year primary borrowing periods.
This provides a regular inflow of funding to cover expenditure as it arises.
Foreign currency risk On 26 July 2010, a $10.0m facility was agreed with RBS to ensure dollar investment in our US joint venture is funded by dollar borrowings to provide an effective foreign currency hedge.
The amount drawn on the facility reflects the investment in and the working capital requirements of the Groups share in its US joint venture.
As the investment and borrowings are both denominated in US $ this provides a natural hedge over the Groups foreign currency exposure.
Credit risk The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables and cash deposits see note 18.
The maximum credit risk exposure of the Group comprises the amounts presented in the balance sheet, which are stated net of provisions for doubtful debt.
A provision is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of future cashflows.
The majority of the Groups receivables are with public or quasi-public bodies such as the DfT.
The Group does not consider these counterparties to be a significant credit risk.
Outside of this, the Group does not consider it has significant concentrations of credit risk.
Risk of exposure to non-return of cash on deposit is managed through a treasury policy of holding deposits with banks rated A or Aa3 or above by at least one of the credit rating agencies.
Our treasury policy outlines the maximum level of deposit that can be placed with any one given financial institution.

Adjusted net debt at the year end was 259.5m 2010: 292.3m, equivalent to 1.58x 2010 restated: 1.94x EBITDA in line with the Groups aim to maintain an adjusted net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x to 2.5x through the cycle.
Operating leases The Group uses operating leases for bus and coach purchases across the Group primarily where the vehicles service specific contracts to mitigate the risk of ownership at the end of the contract.
This results in 1.5m 2010: 1.2m of cost within operating charges which would otherwise have been charged to interest.
The Group holds operating leases for its bus fleet with an asset capital value of 38.0m 2010: 31.2m.
The majority of assets in the rail division are financed by operating leases, in particular rolling stock.
Leases are entered into by the respective operating companies and are not the subject of parent company guarantees.

The fair value of the 200m sterling 7.5 year bond has been determined by reference to the price available from the market on which the bond is traded.
The fuel price derivatives and interest rate swaps were valued externally by the respective banks by comparison with the market fuel price for the relevant date.
All other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
As at 2 July 2011, the Group has used a level 2 valuation technique to determine the fair value of all financial instruments.
During the year ended 2 July 2011, there were no transfers between valuation levels.
Hedging activities Fuel derivatives The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of fuel usage.
The Group closely monitors fuel prices and uses fuel derivatives to hedge its exposure to increases in fuel prices, when it deems appropriate.
At the year end, the Group had various fuel price swaps in place.
For the 2012, 2013 and 2014 financial years cashflow hedges were placed over 122, 72 and 31 million litres of fuel respectively.
The fair value of the asset or liability has been recognised on the balance sheet.
The value has been generated since the date of the acquisition of the instruments due to the movement in market fuel prices.
As at 2 July 2011 the Group had derivatives against bus fuel of 105 million litres for the year ending 30 June 2012, representing approximately 91.0% of the anticipated fuel usage in our bus division.
As at 2 July 2011 the Group also had derivatives against bus fuel for the 2013 and 2014 financial years of 58 and 31 million litres respectively.
As at 2 July 2011 the Group had derivatives against rail fuel of 17 million litres for the year ending 30 June 2011, representing the anticipated fuel usage in London Midland and Southern.
As at 2 July 2011 the Group also had further derivatives for the 2013 financial year of 14 million litres of rail fuel.

During the year ended 2 July 2011 the onerous contract provision in the aviation services division reduced from 0.6m to nil as a result of the sale of the remaining aviation services in the year.
The onerous contract provision in the bus division reduced from 1.0m to 0.4m as the expected costs were incurred on operating lease commitments served by articulated buses being phased out.
Onerous contracts provisions are expected to be incurred within three years, with 0.2m being classified as current.
Franchise commitments comprise 40.1m dilapidation provisions on vehicles, depots and stations across our three active rail franchises and 4.7m claims of other disputes.
Of the dilapidation provisions, 1.4m are classified as current, and all of the 4.7m income claims are classified as current.
The provisions are based on managements assessment of most probable outcomes, supported where appropriate by valuations from professional external advisers.
The dilapidations will be incurred as part of a rolling maintenance contract over the next six years.
Following a management review, it was decided that uninsured claims be classified as provisions given the expected timing and nature of these claims.
Of the uninsured claims, 15.6m are classified as current and 33.4m are classified as non current based on past experience of uninsured claims paid out annually.
It is estimated that the majority of uninsured claims will be settled within the next six years.
Provisions at 27 June 2009 have been increased by the uninsured claims liability of 40.2m and by 13.1m in respect of franchise commitments, previously included within trade and other payables.
Provisions at 3 July 2010 have been increased by the uninsured claims liability of 40.0m and by 13.2m in respect of franchise commitments, previously included within trade and other payables.

The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Plan is 5.2m 2010: 5.4m being the contributions paid and payable.
The defined benefit section of The Go-Ahead Plan is contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and provides benefits based on a members final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
Contributions to this section are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The section is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result, it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The Go-Ahead Plan is a Group plan for related companies where risks are shared.
The overall costs of the Go-Ahead Plan have been recognised in the Groups financial statements according to IAS 19.
Each of the participating companies accounts on the basis of contributions paid by that company.
The Group accounts for the difference between the aggregate IAS 19 cost of the scheme and the aggregate contributions paid.
Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan Some employees of our Go South Coast operations participate in the Wilts & Dorset Pension Scheme or the Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan.
These are defined benefit schemes which are externally funded and contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme.
Contributions to the schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The schemes are closed to new entrants, however eligible employees can join the defined contribution section of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The expense recognised for the defined contribution section of the Wilts & Dorset Scheme and Southern Vectis Group Pension Plan is 0.1m 2010: 01. m being the contributions paid and payable.
The Go-Ahead Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 122 Other pension plans A defined benefit plan exists for a small number of employees who transferred from East Thames Buses.
Similarly some employees of Plymouth Citybus have entitlement to a Devon County Council defined benefit plan.
Both schemes are externally funded.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Both schemes are now closed to new entrants.
Other pension arrangements A small number of employees in aviance had access to separate defined contribution pension arrangements as part of legacy agreements.
The expense recognised for this is nil 2010: 0.1m, being the contributions paid.

The discount rate is based on the anticipated return of AA rated corporate bonds with a term matching the maturity of the scheme liabilities.
The most significant non-financial assumption is the assumed rate of longevity.

The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward looking views of the financial markets suggested by the yields available, and the views of investment organisations.
Sensitivity analysis In making the valuation, the above assumptions have been used.
For non-rail pension schemes, the following is an approximate sensitivity analysis of the impact of the change in the key assumptions.

The RPS is a shared costs scheme, with assets and liabilities split 60% 40% between the franchise holder employee respectively.
The RPS sections are all open to new entrants and the assets and liabilities of each companys section are separately identifiable and segregated for funding purposes.
In addition to the defined benefit cost, BRASS matching AVC company contributions of 0.9m 2010: 1.2m were paid in the year.
It is our experience that all pension obligations to the RPS cease on expiry of the franchises without cash or other settlement, and therefore the obligations recognised on the balance sheet under IAS 19 are only those that are expected to be funded during the franchise term.
However, in spite of our past experience and that of other train operating companies proving otherwise, our legal obligations are not restricted.
On entering into a franchise, the operator becomes the designated employer for the term of the contract and under the RPS rules is obliged to meet the schedule of contributions agreed with the scheme trustees and actuaries, in respect of which no funding cap is set out in the franchise contract.

Following industry practice, the Group has concluded that the appropriate accounting policy for the RPS to ensure that the financial statements present fairly the Groups financial position, financial performance and cashflows, is to recognise its constructive but not its legal RPS defined benefit obligations.
In all other respects the Groups accounting policy is consistent with IAS 19 and the treatment adopted for non-rail defined benefit schemes.
In doing so, the Group has applied the provisions of paragraph 17 of IAS 1 and departed from the requirements of IAS 19 in order to achieve a fair presentation of the Groups obligations regarding its rail schemes and prevent gains arising on transfer of the existing RPS deficits to a new franchise owner at exit.
The total surplus or deficit recorded is adjusted by way of a franchise adjustment, which is that portion of the deficit or surplus projected to exist at the end of the franchise which the Group will not be required to fund or benefit from.
If the Group had accounted for the rail schemes in accordance with the full provisions of IAS 19 the following adjustments would have been made to the financial statements: 2011 2010 m m Balance sheet Defined benefit pension plan 193.7 337.5 Deferred tax asset 46.9 89.7 Intangible asset 13.3 17.2 133.5 230.6 Other comprehensive income Actuarial losses gains 161.5 100.6 Tax on actuarial losses gains 42.0 28.2 119.5 72.4 Income statement Operating costs franchise adjustment 17.8 13.5 Intangible asset amortisation 3.9 4.0 Deferred tax charge 3.6 2.7 10.3 6.8 IAS 19 disclosures All of the above plans have been accounted for under IAS 19 covering employee benefits.
