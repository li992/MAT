General information HomeServe plc is a Company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act.
The address of the registered office is Cable Drive, Walsall WS2 7BN.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
Significant accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
Adoption of new or revised standards and accounting policies In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted in these financial statements.
The Group has adopted IFRS3 Business Combinations revised 2008 and IAS27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements revised 2008.
The most significant changes to the Groups previous accounting policies for business combinations are that acquisition related costs, which previously would have been included in the cost of a business combination, are included in operating costs as they are incurred.
The revised standards have been applied to the acquisitions in the current year, as described in note 33.
Any adjustments to contingent consideration for acquisitions made prior to 31 March 2010 which result in an adjustment to goodwill continue to be accounted for under IFRS3 2004 and IAS27 2005.
IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners, IFRS2 amended Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions and Improvements to IFRSs 2009 have also been adopted in the year but their adoption has not had any significant impact on the amounts reported in these financial statements.
Standards in issue but not yet effective At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following Standards and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS9 Financial Instruments IAS24 revised Nov 2009 Related Party Disclosures Amendments to IAS12 Dec 2010 Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets Amendments to IFRS7 Oct 2010 Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets Amendments to IFRIC14 Nov 2009 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement IFRIC19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Improvements to IFRSs May 2010 The implementation of IFRS9 which the Group expects to adopt for the year beginning on 1 April 2013 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of Financial Instruments.
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments, and on a going concern basis as set out in the Corporate governance statement.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
HomeServe 93 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 2.
Significant accounting policies continued On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised at cost as an asset at the date control is acquired the acquisition date.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Groups cash generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
If the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash generating unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or joint venture, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
HomeServe 94 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Financial statements Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that date.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Investments in joint ventures The Groups share of results of joint ventures is included in the consolidated income statement using the equity method of accounting.
The Groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet, including associated goodwill.
Based on the guidance of IAS28 Investments in Associates, provision for the Groups share of the joint venture losses is not recognised if the recognition of such losses reduces the Groups share of the joint ventures net assets below zero where there is no recourse to the Group to fund these losses.
Revenue recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT, Insurance Premium Tax and other sales related taxes.
Revenue recorded by the Group includes commissions receivable in the Groups role as an intermediary in the policy sale and administration process.
Any third-party costs incurred on behalf of the principal that are rechargeable under the contractual arrangement, or where the Groups role is only as an intermediary in the cash collection process, are not included in revenue.
Consequently, on the sale of a policy, gross revenue consists of only a component of the overall policy price, representing the commission receivable for the marketing and sale of the policy, stated net of sales related taxes.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate arrangements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an optional extra, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contract.
Accordingly, revenue is recognised on the sale of a policy except where an obligation exists to provide future services, typically claims handling and policy administration services.
In these situations, a proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future claims handling costs and margin, is deferred over the life of the policy, as deferred income.
The assessment of future claims handling takes account of the expected numbers of claims and the estimated cost of handling those claims, which are validated through experience of historical actual costs.
The deferred revenue is released over the expected profile of anticipated claims over the policy period.
The deferral also includes a profit element to recognise the performance of these services in the future.
Revenue on sales of franchises is recognised when the obligations to the franchisee are complete.
Revenue on the sale of new franchise licences is recognised upon the signing of the related franchise agreement.
These franchise fees are non-refundable and primarily relate to initial set-up services.
Repair revenue relates to repairs undertaken on behalf of underwriters subject to separate contractual arrangements.
Such revenue is recognised on completion of the repair.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
HomeServe 95 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange movements, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such cumulative exchange movements are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after charging all operating costs and after the share of results of joint ventures net of tax but before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the statement of comprehensive income.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and is otherwise amortised on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted for unrecognised past service cost, and as reduced by the fair value of scheme assets.
Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
HomeServe 96 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Financial statements The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other than land, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Buildings 25-50 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment 7 years Computer equipment 3-7 years Motor vehicles 3 years with 25% residual value Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
Intangible assets Intangible assets arising on the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business are stated at their fair value and are amortised over their useful lives, using the straight-line method, as follows: Customer relationships 3-15 years Customer databases 3-10 years Franchise assets 3-15 years Trademarks and similar access rights, acquired on an exclusive use basis from third party commercial partners, are also treated as intangible assets.
These assets are recorded at cost and amortised on a straight-line basis over the length of the contractual agreement up to a maximum of 20 years.
Computer software and the related licences are stated at cost and amortised over their useful lives of three to seven years.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the assets for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
HomeServe 97 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 2.
Significant accounting policies continued Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is measured on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are classified either at fair value through profit or loss FVTPL or loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at FVTPL or other financial liabilities.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Borrowings Interest-bearing loans and overdrafts are stated at amortised cost and are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Hedge accounting The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives.
Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are deferred in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement and is included within finance costs.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was deferred in equity is recognised immediately in the income statement.
HomeServe 98 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Financial statements Amounts deferred in equity are recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item is also recognised in the income statement in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Any cumulative gain or loss deferred in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at amortised cost.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 Share-Based Payments.
In accordance with the transitional provision, IFRS2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 April 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to purchase the Groups ordinary shares at a discount to the current market value through Save As You Earn schemes.
The Group also issues cash-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
For cash-settled sharebased payments, a liability is recognised for the services acquired, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At each balance sheet date, until the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in the profit or loss for the year.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model or Monte Carlo Simulation models depending on the type of scheme.
Own shares reserve Shares of the parent Company that are purchased by the HomeServe plc Employee Benefit Trust are held at cost and shown as a deduction in equity.
Cost comprises consideration paid, including directly attributable costs.
The shares are held to satisfy obligations under the share option schemes.
HomeServe 99 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 3.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Revenue recognition An appropriate proportion of revenue, sufficient to cover future costs and margin, is deferred to future periods when the Group has obligations extending to future periods.
As a result, judgement is required in assessing the extent and associated costs of fulfilling those future obligations.
The Group uses historical experience and forecast activity levels in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise in the current period and how much to defer to future periods.
An assessment is also made of any factors that are likely to materially affect the economic benefits which will flow to the Group such as policy cancellations.
To the extent that economic benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, the value of that revenue is not recognised.
The Group uses historical experience in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognise.
Valuation of acquisition intangible assets Acquisitions may result in customer relationships and customer databases being recognised as intangible assets.
These are valued using the excess earnings method.
In applying this methodology certain key judgements and estimates are required to be made in respect of future cash flows together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
Impairment of goodwill and acquisition intangible assets The annual impairment assessment in respect of goodwill and acquisition intangibles requires estimates of the value in use or fair value less costs to sell of cash-generating units to which goodwill and acquisition intangibles have been allocated.
As a result, estimates of future cash flows are required, together with an appropriate discount factor for the purpose of determining the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying value of acquisition intangibles is 37,157,000 2010: 27,931,000.
Following the annual impairment review, no impairment charge has been recorded against goodwill or acquisition intangibles in either year.
As set out in note 14, reasonably possible changes in respect of commercial outcomes around sales volumes, prices, margins and discount rates can impact the recoverable value.
Pensions The Group participates in a defined benefit retirement scheme for certain employees.
The scheme assets and liabilities are valued by an independent qualified actuary using the assumptions summarised in note 39.
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation has been measured using the projected unit credit method which requires the use of judgement and estimation.
Revenue From 1 April 2010 the UK financial results include the revenue and costs of repair jobs undertaken by sub-contract engineers.
This reflects a change in the Groups commercial relationship with its underwriter where it now provides a full repair service to underwriters instead of the previous repair administration service.
This change has increased both revenue and costs by 41,700,000 in the current year: it only affects the UK and there is no impact on profits.

Business and geographical segments Segment revenues and results IFRS8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker, who is considered to be the Chief Executive, to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
The internal reporting of the Group has changed during the year such that all established businesses are reviewed individually, and all other new operations are reviewed collectively as New Markets.
Prior year presentation has been restated to reflect this new segmental analysis.
Inter-segment revenue is charged at prevailing market prices.
Segment profit loss represents the result of each segment including allocating costs associated with head office and shared functions, but before allocating investment income, finance costs and tax.
This is the measure reported to the Groups Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Significant Accounting Policies except in relation to our joint venture, Domo, in France where the following adjustments are made for segmental reporting purposes: a revenue is included in Total Revenue and b shareholder fees from Domo are added back, and Group cost allocations are deducted in arriving at segmental operating profit.

In addition to the amount charged to the income statement and other comprehensive income, the following amounts relating to tax have been recognised directly in equity: 2011 2010 000 000 Current tax Excess tax deductions related to Share-based payments on exercised options 1,698 1,798 Deferred tax Change in estimated excess tax deductions related to Share-based payments 28 775 Total tax recognised directly in equity 1,726 2,573 HomeServe 105 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 11.
Tax continued On 23 March 2011 the Government announced that the main rate of Corporation Tax would reduce to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011, with subsequent 1% reductions per annum to reach 23% with effect from 1 April 2014.
The change to 26% took statutory effect when it was approved by the House of Commons on 29 March 2011, therefore the reduction had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and has been reflected in the financial statements for deferred tax purposes.
The subsequent proposed reductions have not been substantively enacted.
The effect of these tax rate changes on the deferred tax balance will be accounted for in the period in which the tax rate reductions are substantively enacted.

Comparative information in respect of the dividend per share has been restated to take account of the share split.
The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011 is 7.0p per share amounting to 22,520,000 2010: 1.7p per share amounting to 5,446,000.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
The second interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2010 of 4.8p per share amounting to 15,278,000 was paid on 1 April 2010 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 5 March 2010.

Goodwill continued During the year, the contingent consideration payable on the 2009 acquisition of SPT Belgium was reduced by 1,755,000.
Goodwill on the acquisition has been reduced accordingly, with the goodwill and contingent consideration being restated in the comparative period.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated at acquisition to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: restated 2011 2010 000 000 UK 154,656 154,567 Spain Reparalia 13,856 14,092 Belgium SPT 4,309 4,436 France SFG 15,079 15,336 United States of America 4,180 192,080 188,431 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rate, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimate the Group discount rate using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and adjust, if necessary, to the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on detailed business plans.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on expectations of future changes in the market.
The Group prepares an annual cash flow forecast derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Directors and extrapolates the annual cash flow using estimated long-term growth rates of between 2% and 2.5% 2010: 2.5% representing long-term growth rates based on respective country GDP rates.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 9% 2010: 11.2%.
Management has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGUs carrying value, the key assumptions are as noted above.
Management believes that there are no reasonably possible changes to the key assumptions in the next year which would result in the carrying amount of goodwill exceeding the recoverable amount.
This view is based upon inherently judgemental assumptions, however, takes account of the headroom in managements internal growth targets verses the conservative growth estimates used in the impairment review.

Other intangible assets Acquisition intangibles represent non-monetary assets, arising on business combinations, and include customer relationships, customer databases and franchise assets relating to purchased franchise licences.

This assessment has been undertaken by reviewing the status of all significant balances that are past due and involves assessing both the reason for non-payment and the credit worthiness of the counterparty.
Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, there is no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread across a large number of counterparties and customers.
There are no customers who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 6,832,000 2010: 4,176,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
The average age of receivables not impaired is 38 days 2010: 40 days.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 2011 2010 000 000 130 days 26 545 3160 days 40 135 6190 days 186 370 91 days 1,033 1,285 1,285 2,335 The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Other receivables As part of its activities, the Group serves as an intermediary, whereby it is responsible for the collection of cash on behalf of third parties.
Other receivables mainly represent those amounts to be collected from policyholders, but to be remitted to third parties for obligations such as the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to individual receivables being small and spread across a diverse policyholder base.
In addition, overall balance sheet exposure is mitigated as defaults on these receivables can, in the most part, be offset against the corresponding payable included in Other creditors.
Cash balances and cash equivalents Cash balances and cash equivalents of 16,101,000 2010: 25,409,000 comprise cash held by the Group and short-term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.

Derivative financial instruments During the year ended 31 March 2008, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a notional value of 50,000,000.
The interest rate swap was used to hedge loans subject to variable interest rates linked to LIBOR, with a fixed interest rate.
The interest rate swap expired during the year ended 31 March 2010.
Further details are set out in note 41.

The carrying amount of the Groups borrowings approximates to their fair value.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: The Group has revolving credit facilities with a number of banks totalling 150,000,000 2010: 150,000,000.
The revolving credit facility was taken out on 20 December 2007 and has a term of five years.
The covenants associated with the credit facilities are net debt to EBITDA of less than 3.5 times and interest cover greater than 4 times operating profit before amortisation.
The Group has complied with all covenant requirements in the current and prior year.
Loan notes are repayable on demand, subject to a minimum initial maturity of six months.
All of the Groups borrowings are currently at floating rates at margins of between 0.1% and 1% above LIBOR, thus exposing the Group to cash flow and interest rate risk.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had available 122,076,000 2010: 72,000,000 of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2011 2010 UK Spain USA 000 000 Deferred tax assets 5,744 1,018 2,791 9,553 8,666 Deferred tax liabilities 3,981 3,981 5,729 Net deferred tax asset 1,763 1,018 2,791 5,572 2,937 At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 23,735,000 2010: 26,800,000 available for offset against future profits and which can be carried forward indefinitely.
A deferred tax asset of 3,809,000 2010: 2,318,000 has been recognised in respect of these losses based on estimates of budgeted profits in the forthcoming year.
Deferred tax has not been recognised on the remainder of these losses due to the uncertainty over the timing of future recovery.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in joint ventures are not material.

The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 52 days 2010: 49 days.
Deferred income represents revenue where an obligation exists to provide future services.
An appropriate proportion of monies received in advance are treated as deferred income and recognised over the relevant period.
HomeServe 114 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Financial statements Other creditors mainly represent liabilities for amounts to be collected from policyholders in respect of the cost of underwriting and Insurance Premium Tax.

33. Business combinations On 12 August 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Keyspan Energy Solutions LLC and National Grid Energy Services New England LLC both trading as National Grid Energy Services.
Together these companies provide home emergency and repair contracts to 183,000 customers.
The acquisition accelerates the current strategy of HomeServe USA of offering utility branded service contracts, in a transaction which brings both existing contracts and the opportunity to add new contracts in previously un-marketed National Grid territories.
This will give HomeServe USA marketing access to an additional 5m residential households.
The acquisition also brings a US centre of excellence in repair management to the Group.
The deferred consideration relates to a part of the overall deal value deferred to future periods.
On 8 March 2011, the Group entered into an agreement with South Jersey Energy Services Plus SJESP.
SJESP services residential and light commercial heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems, provides plumbing repair services, and provides repair services under service contracts for appliances in New Jersey.
These services are provided to in excess of 59,000 customers and include in excess of 125,000 distinct service contracts with those customers.
The Group acquired the exclusive right to acquire these customer relationships, and to renew all existing and new customer contracts.
The deferred consideration includes amounts dependent upon the retention and transfer of the customer relationships to the Group and other amounts deferred to future periods.
The recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below: National Grid Energy Services South Jersey Energy Services Plus Original Fair value Fair Original Fair value Fair Total book value adjustments value book value adjustments value fair value 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net assets acquired: Property, plant and equipment 1,227 122 1,105 1,105 Other intangibles 149 149 149 Trade and other receivables 3,836 3,836 3,836 Inventories 1,382 350 1,032 1,032 Cash and cash equivalents 91 91 91 Trade and other payables 12,439 1,319 13,758 13,758 Total identifiable liabilities 5,754 1,791 7,545 7,545 Intangible assets identified on acquisition 14,203 5,512 19,715 Goodwill 4,282 4,282 Total consideration 10,940 5,512 16,452 Satisfied by: Cash 9,786 1,853 11,639 Deferred consideration 1,154 3,659 4,813 10,940 5,512 16,452 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration 9,786 1,853 11,639 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 91 91 9,695 1,853 11,548 HomeServe 117 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements Year ended 31 March 2011 33. Business combinations continued National Grid Energy Services The provisional fair value adjustments recognised on the acquisition of National Grid Energy Services relate to the best estimate of provisions against assets, the recognition of additional liabilities as at the acquisition date and the recognition of intangible assets on acquisition.
Goodwill of 4,282,000 arose from the acquisition 39,000 increase from the 4,243,000 disclosed in the Condensed Consolidated financial statements for the six months ended 30 September 2010, due principally to an update to the assessment of liabilities on acquisition.
The goodwill arising on the excess of consideration over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired represents the expectation of synergy savings and efficiencies.
The goodwill and intangible assets are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The acquisition contributed 16,022,000 in revenue and a profit before acquisition amortisation of 2,990,000 profit of 1,913,000 post acquisition amortisation since acquisition on 12 August 2010.
It is not practicable to disclose the revenue and profit before tax between 1 April 2010 and 12 August 2010 because the acquired companies operated a number of other businesses, which were discontinued during that period by the vendor.
Costs in respect of the acquisition of the business, relating to legal and financial advisory services, were not significant during the year and were expensed to operating results.
South Jersey Energy Services Plus The acquisition of SJESP results in intangible assets relating to the exclusive access to customer and marketing databases.
As the consideration relates principally to the acquisition of these exclusive access rights, no goodwill arises.
The intangibles assets are expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
Due to the timing of the acquisition, there was no significant contribution to the Groups results for the year.
It is not practicable to disclose the revenue and profit before tax between 1 April 2010 and 8 March 2011 because the acquired business was subsumed in the vendors other activities and therefore this information is not available.
In addition to the net cash outflow arising on the acquisitions above of 11,548,000, contingent and deferred consideration of 4,685,000 was paid relating to current and prior period acquisitions: and additional goodwill of 89,000 was recognised in respect of adjustments to consideration relating to other prior acquisitions.
Discontinued operations In the prior year, the Group exited from its Emergency Services Division through the disposal of a number of businesses and the closure of the Property Repairs business, resulting in a 2010 reported loss of 42,025,000.
In the current year there was no profit or loss.
During the year, the discontinued operations had a net cash inflow of 1,824,000 2010: outflow of 17,705,000 in respect of operating cash flows, paid nil 2010: 962,000 in respect of investing activities and paid nil 2010: nil in respect of financing activities.

The average lease term is 5 years.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, the average effective borrowing rate was 3%.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract date.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
All lease obligations are denominated in US dollars.
The fair value of the Groups lease obligations is approximately equal to their carrying amount.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors rights over the leased assets disclosed in note 16.
Share-based payments During the year ended 31 March 2011, the Group had five 2010: six share-based payment arrangements, which are described below: i Executive Share Option Plan ESOP The ESOP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years and is dependent upon the real increase in Earnings Per Share over the vesting period.
In addition, since 2006, vesting has also been dependant upon a share price target.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
ii 2005 Key Executive Incentive Plan KEIP The KEIP provides for a grant price equal to the closing quoted market price of the Companys shares on the day before the date of grant.
The awards vest in two tranches, the first being between three and four years from the date of grant and the second being on the second anniversary of the vesting of the first tranche.
The number of awards vesting was dependent upon the Profit Before Tax of the Group for the year ended 31 March 2008 and was subject to a minimum share price criteria during the year ending 31 March 2009.
iii Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The LTIP provides for the grant of performance and matching awards.
The vesting period is three years and for the awards granted in 2008 and 2009 vesting is dependent upon the Total Shareholder Return performance of the Group over the relevant performance period.
From 2010, 50% of the award is dependent upon Total Shareholder Return and 50% is subject to a target based on Earnings per Share growth.
If the awards remain unexercised after a period of one year from vesting, they expire.
HomeServe 120 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Financial statements iv Deferred Bonus Plan DBP The Deferred Bonus Plan enables the individual to defer receipt of their annual cash bonus up to a maximum of 100% and to invest an equivalent amount in the ordinary share capital of the Company.
The deferred bonus may be matched by the Company dependent upon the Companys relative Total Shareholder Return over a three year period, up to a maximum of 300% of the deferred amount for upper decile performance.
The shares cannot normally be exercised for three years and lapse if not exercised within 10 years from the date of grant.
v Save As You Earn Scheme SAYE The SAYE is open to all UK employees and provides for an exercise price equal to the closing quoted market price on the day before the date of grant, less a discretionary discount.
The options can be exercised during a six month period following the completion of either a three or five year savings period.
2 The figures in the table relate to the number of deferred options only.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 4.59 2010: 3.25.
The estimated fair values are calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model for the ESOP and SAYE and Monte Carlo simulations for the KEIP, LTIP and Deferred Bonus Plan.
The assumptions used in the models which are comparable to the prior year are as follows: Input Assumption Share price Price at date of grant Exercise price Per scheme rules Expected volatility 20% 45% Option life Per scheme rules Expected dividends Based on historic dividend yield Risk free interest rate 3.8% 5.2% Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
Volatility is calculated by looking at the historical share price movements prior to the date of grant over a period of time commensurate with the remaining term for each award.
The Group recognised total expenses of 2,899,000 2010: 2,397,000 related to equity-settled, sharebased payment transactions and total expenses of 45,000 2010: nil related to cash-settled share-based payment transactions.

Retirement benefit schemes Defined contribution schemes The Group operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for all qualifying employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Where there are employees who leave the scheme prior to the contributions fully vesting, the contributions paid by the Group are forfeited by the employee.
The total cost charged to income of 2,723,000 2010: 2,484,000 represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates specified in the rules of the plans.
At 31 March 2011, contributions of 249,000 2010: nil due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes.
Defined benefit scheme The Group participates in a defined benefit scheme, the Water Companies Pension Scheme, for qualifying employees.
This is a sectionalised scheme and the Group participates in the HomeServe plc Section of the Scheme.
The Section funds are administered by the trustees and are independent of the Groups finances.
Contributions are paid to the Section in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuarial adviser.
The results of the actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008 were updated to 31 March 2011 by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with IAS19.
As required by IAS19, the value of the defined benefit obligation and the current service cost have been measured using the projected unit credit method.
In July 2010, the government announced its intention that future revaluation pension increase orders would be measured by the Consumer Prices Index, rather than the Retail Prices Index.
The impact of this change on the benefits provided by the Section has been reflected in the Companys assumptions and an actuarial gain of 2,331,000 has been recognised as a result.
This amount is included within the actuarial gains recognised outside profit and loss in other comprehensive income in the figures below.
Valuation at 2011 2010 Key assumptions used: Discount rate at 31 March 5.6% 5.6% Consumer price inflation 3.0% n a Retail price inflation 3.7% 3.9% Expected rate of salary increases 5.2% 5.4% Future pension increases 3.0% 3.9% Expected rate of return on scheme assets at 31 March 7.8% 8.0% Life expectancy of male aged 60 at balance sheet date 26.5 yrs 26.4 yrs Pensions accounting entries are subject to judgement and volatility, as the assets are largely linked to the equity market, whereas the present value of the obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds.
As an indication, all other things being equal: an increase in the discount rate of 0.1% would lead to a reduction in the value placed on the obligations of the Section of approximately 0.4m: and a 5% rise in the value of the Sections return seeking portfolio would improve the balance sheet position by approximately 0.8m.
Amounts recognised in income in respect of the defined benefit scheme are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Current service cost 171 263 Interest cost 1,145 861 Expected return on scheme assets 1,263 820 Past service cost 316 Recognised in operating costs 53 620 The actual return on scheme assets was a gain of 1,201,000 2010: gain of 4,807,000.

The amount recognised outside the income statement in the statement of comprehensive income for 2011 is a gain of 3,656,000 2010: loss of 2,664,000.
The cumulative amount recognised outside profit and loss at 31 March 2011 is a loss of 658,000.
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date was as follows: Expected return Fair value of assets 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % 000 000 Equity instruments 7.8 8.0 13,150 15,326 Diversified growth funds 7.3 3,180 Other assets 4.3 4.5 1,508 848 17,838 16,174 The overall expected rate of return on assets for the financial year ending 31 March 2011 was 7.8% per annum 2010: 8.0% per annum.
This rate is derived by taking the weighted average of the long-term expected rate of return on each of the asset classes that the Section was invested in at 31 March 2010.

Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Groups long-term debt requirements with floating interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debts.
To manage this, the Group enters into interest rate swaps for certain periods, in which the Group agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and variable rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional principal amount.
These swaps are designated to hedge underlying debt obligations.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities based on contractual maturities is provided in the table below.
Interest is payable on the bank overdraft and revolving credit facilities.
Deferred and contingent consideration payments are stated on the basis of expected cash outflows before discounting.
The actual payment profile of Other creditors is dependent upon the collection of the corresponding Other receivables from policyholders.
These amounts principally relate to underwriting, which are collected from policyholders and remitted to underwriters following cash collection.
Therefore, the actual cash flows may differ from those presented, but will not result in the acceleration of the settlement of the liability.

It is the Groups policy that, with the exception of our policy membership customers, customers who wish to trade on credit terms are reviewed for financial stability.
The majority of the Groups trade receivables consist of a large number of individual members and hence for these balances the Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to a single counterparty.
As a result, the Groups exposure to bad debts is not considered to be significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other financial assets of the Group, which comprise cash and cash equivalents and investment in joint ventures, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty.
The Group manages the risk associated with cash and cash equivalents through depositing funds only with reputable and creditworthy banking institutions.
The risk associated with the investment in joint ventures is mitigated through the close management and regular review of the performance of the assets.
The Group has a maximum exposure equal to the carrying amount of the above receivables and instruments.
Liquidity risk Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Groups Board which sets the framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows.
Included in note 22 are details of the undrawn facilities that are available to the Group to further reduce liquidity risk.
With the exception of deferred and contingent consideration, all of the Groups financial liabilities are due for payment within two years, based on contractual payment terms.
