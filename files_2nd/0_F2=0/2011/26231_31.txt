New NED Shareholding requirement In addition to the review of fees, it was also felt appropriate to introduce a minimum shareholding requirementfor NEDs.
NEDs are now required to hold the equivalent of one years base fee in Legal & General sharesto be retained until the end of ofce.
NEDs will continue to have a proportion of their fees normally 50% paid in Legal&General shares until this level is reached.
Once the level is reached, they may take all their fee in cash.
