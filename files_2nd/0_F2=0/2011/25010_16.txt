ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements Information for shareholders 01 15 17 41 43 61 ICAP plc Annual Report 2011 63 133 134 73 The amendments to IAS27 have also resulted in changes to the Groups accounting policies.
Previously transactions with non-controlling interests were treated as transactions with parties external to the Group.
Disposals therefore resulted in gains or losses in the consolidated income statement and purchases resulted in the recognition of goodwill.
On disposal or partial disposal, a proportionate interest in reserves attributable to the subsidiary was reclassified to the consolidated income statement or directly to retained earnings.
Previously, when the Group ceased to have control or significant influence over an entity, the carrying amount of the investment at the date control or date when significant influence was lost, became its cost for the purposes of subsequently accounting for the retained interests as associates, jointly controlled entities or financial assets.
The Group has applied the new policy prospectively to transactions occurring on or after 1 April 2010.
As a consequence, no adjustments were necessary to any of the amounts previously recognised in the consolidated financial statements.
A number of other interpretations and amendments to existing standards have been made by the IASB and IFRIC but are not considered relevant to the Groups operations.
The following new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued, but are not effective for the financial year beginning 1 April 2010 and have not been early adopted: Revised IAS24 Related Party Disclosures was issued in November 2009 and is required to be applied for accounting periods on or after 1 January 2011.
It supersedes IAS24 Related Party Disclosures issued in 2003.
The impact of the adoption of the standard will result in minor changes to the disclosure.
IFRS9 Financial Instruments addresses clarification and measurement of financial assets, as the first phase of the replacement of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and is effective for annual periods beginning after 1 January 2013, subject to EU endorsement.
The impact on the Groups financial statements of the future adoption of the standard is still under review.
Financial risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to a variety of financial risks including currency, interest rate, market price, liquidity and credit.
The Groups overall financial risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance by using derivative instruments to lower funding costs, alter interest rate exposures arising as a result of mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
The use of derivatives forms part of the Groups overall risk management framework as determined by the board through the GRACC.
The Groups funding and exposure to interest rate and FX rate risk are managed by the Groups treasury function in accordance with a policy framework approved by the GRACC.
The framework lays out the Groups appetite for risk and the steps to be taken to manage these risks.
The GRACC receives bi-monthly reports on the activities of the treasury function and is also responsible for approving significant transactions such as new financing arrangements or changes to the Groups hedging strategy.
The GRACC sets and monitors treasurys counterparty limits in conjunction with the risk team.
The Groups exposure to market price risk arises mainly through counterparties to matched principal and exchange traded transactions failing to fulfil their obligations or through trade mismatches and other errors.
In matched principal transactions, the Group acts as an intermediary by serving as counterparty for identified buyers and sellers in matching, in whole or in part, reciprocal back-to-back trades.
In order to facilitate customer transactions and provide liquidity, the Group may participate in certain marketplaces by posting quotations.
On occasion, the act of posting quotations in pursuit of customer orders can result in the Group becoming principal to unmatched trades.
In exchange traded transactions, the Group executes the trade as principal and then novates the contract to its client.
A failure by the client to accept the trade would result in the Group becoming exposed to market price risk.
The market price risk the Group faces in these situations is restricted to short-term price movements in the underlying instrument temporarily held by the Group and movements in FX rates.
Any such market price risk arising is identified, monitored and reported to senior management on a daily basis and to the GRACC.
Policies and procedures are in place to reduce the likelihood of such trade mismatches and, in the event that they arise, the Groups policy is to liquidate or hedge and liquidate these principal positions as soon as reasonably practicable.
The Company is not exposed to market price risk as it holds no listed investments, and has no trading activity.
Details of the exposure and ways in which the Group and Company manages currency and interest rate risk are disclosed in note 10, liquidity risk in note 8 and credit risk in note 17.

The Group considers the executive members of the Companys board to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM currently considers the business to consist of core and new business elements, although it expects the new business segment to be incorporated into core businesses next year.
The core business consists of regional voice broking businesses in EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific, a global electronic broking business active in fixed income interest rate derivatives and FX markets and a global post trade risk and information business.
Each of these five business areas are managed and reviewed by the CODM on a stand-alone basis and, as such, are considered segments.
In addition, the CODM separately manages and reviews a portfolio of new business initiatives, currently comprising new voice broking businesses, which were either acquired or started during the course of the past two financial years.
The Group reviews the composition of the operating segments at the beginning of each fiscal year to determine whether they remain appropriate.
Any changes would result in restatement of the figures reported in the prior year for comparative purposes.
Revenue comprises commission from the Groups core voice broking business, brokerage or access fees from its electronic broking business and fees from the provision of post trade risk and information.
Core voice broking Matched principal and stock lending business Certain Group companies are involved in a non-advisory capacity as principals in the matched purchase and sale of securities and other financial instruments between our customers.
Revenue is generated from the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds and is recognised in full at the time of the commitment by our customers to sell and purchase the security or financial instrument.
The revenue generated by the stock lending business is not material to the Group.
Agency business name give-up transactions The Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of financial instruments and raises invoices for the service provided.
The Group does not act as principal in name give-up transactions and only receives and transmits orders between counterparties.
Revenue is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes and is recognised in full on the date of the trade.
Amounts receivable at the year end are reported as other trade receivables within trade and other receivables note 17.
For the shipbroking business, the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity to match buyers and sellers of services and recognises revenue, net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes when the Group has a contractual entitlement to commission, normally the point at which there is a completion of contractual terms between the principals of a transaction.
Execution on exchange business The Group also acts as a broker of exchange listed products, where the Group executes customer orders as principal and then novates the trade to the underlying customers respective clearing broker for settlement.
Revenue is generated from either the difference between the purchase and sale proceeds or by invoice, depending on the product, market and agreements in place with the customer and is recognised on the trade date.
Electronic broking The Group acts as a broker for FX, interest rate derivatives, fixed income products and CDS through the Groups electronic platforms.
Revenue is generated from brokerage fees which are dependent on the customer's global coverage and average trading volumes.
The Group also charges fees to use the electronic trading platform for access to liquidity in the FX or precious metal markets.
Post trade risk and information The Group receives fees from the sale of financial information and provision of post trade risk and information to third parties.
These are stated net of value added tax, rebates and other sales taxes and recognised in revenue on an accruals basis to match the provision of the service.
76 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Segmental information continued Reorganisation of portfolio The new businesses segment principally consists of Brazil, intellectual property, base metals and UK and Asia financial futures.
For the period commencing 1 April 2010, Link and ICAP Shipping have been moved out of the new business segment as they are no longer new to the Group.
Link has been split between each of the three core voice segments.
ICAP Shipping is now included within EMEA voice broking.
Comparatives have been re-presented to show the impact.
Each of the operating segments of the Group is managed on a day-to-day basis by one or more members of the GEMG, which consists of both members of the board and other senior management.
The management of new businesses is dependent on which core area the business will eventually become part of.
TriOptima, acquired on 24 March 2010, is included within post trade risk and information and not as a new business, as the Group held a minority interest prior to the acquisition and has had a significant influence over the business since inception.
As a result of the decreasing number of new businesses set up or established over the past two financial years, it is planned to discontinue the new businesses segment for the year ending 31 March 2012 and instead to combine the initiatives into the segment operated by the appropriate member of the GEMG.
The decision to no longer report the new businesses segment reflects managements decision 12 months ago to focus on organic expansion and developing partnerships with customers.
This has resulted in a low level of new business initiatives which do not otherwise meet the criteria to be reported under the core segments.
No longer presenting new businesses separately will result in the other segments initially showing lower margins while businesses such as Brazil move towards operational maturity.
The Group continues to disclose an operating segment for the voice broking business in Asia Pacific even though this segment does not meet the quantitative thresholds to be mandatory under IFRS8 Operating Segments.
This is to reflect the importance of the Asia Pacific region to the Group and the way the segment is managed.

78 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Earnings per share The Group presents basic and diluted EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
The Group also calculates adjusted EPS from the adjusted profit which is defined as profit from operations before the effect of acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.
The Group believes that this is the most appropriate measurement since it better reflects the businesss underlying cash earnings.
The Group is required to disclose basic and diluted EPS on the face of the consolidated income statement and has further analysed this to show the adjusted EPS for continuing operations.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held as Treasury Shares of 4m 2010 2m and those owned by employee share trusts relating to employee share schemes on which dividends have been waived, being 6m shares 2010 9m.
The Group has also disclosed the impact of discontinued operations on the basic, diluted and adjusted EPS.

The directors have proposed a final dividend of 14.68p per share for the year ended 31 March 2011.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end, the total amount payable would be 96m.
No scrip dividend alternative was offered in relation to the interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2011.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of the shares held in employee share trusts and no dividend is payable on Treasury Shares.
4 Tax Tax on the profit for the year comprises both current and deferred tax as well as adjustments in respect of prior years.
Tax is charged or credited to the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited to other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the tax is also included in other comprehensive income or directly within equity, respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates enacted, or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, in respect of temporary differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities for reporting purposes and the amounts charged or credited for tax purposes.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rate of tax expected to apply when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and intangibles arising on consolidation, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
No provision is made in respect of any further tax liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas joint ventures and associates.
Deferred tax liabilities are offset against deferred tax assets within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group where there is both the legal right and the intention to settle on a net basis or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Significant judgement is required in determining the Groups income tax liabilities.
In arriving at the current and deferred tax liability the Group has taken account of tax issues that are subject to ongoing discussions with the relevant tax authorities.
Calculations of these liabilities have been based on managements assessment of legal and professional advice, case law and other relevant guidance.
Where the expected tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were recorded initially, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax amounts in the period in which such determination is made.

In addition to the changes in rates of Corporation Tax that were announced in the Finance Act 2010 which saw the main rate of Corporation Tax reduced to 27% from 1 April 2011, a number of further changes to the UK Corporation Tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
A resolution passed by Parliament on 29 March 2011 reduced the main rate of Corporation Tax to 26% from 1 April 2011.
As a result of this change, the Group's deferred tax liability has been reduced by 2m.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of Corporation Tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by a further 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are not included in the tax charge for the period.
The reduction to 23% is not expected to have a material impact on the deferred tax balances.

Deferred tax assets of 8m 2010 6m have not been recognised in respect of certain trading losses because it is not probable that future profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits.
The principal movement in deferred tax relates to the ongoing release of the deferred tax liability on the amortisation of intangibles arising on consolidation.
84 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 Exceptional items Exceptional items are significant items of a non-recurring nature and considered material in both size and nature.
These are disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups financial performance.
Transactions which may give rise to exceptional items are principally gains and losses on disposal of investments and other large gains and losses not attributable to the normal course of the Groups activities.
These are shown as exceptional items on the face of the consolidated income statement.

Contractual arrangements The Group places reliance on a number of key suppliers to carry out its business and has procedures to ensure that purchasing decisions balance cost against other factors including service quality, global reach and resilience.
The success of ICAPs core voice broking business is reliant on its ability to attract and retain highly qualified staff.
Staff costs represent approximately 68% of total costs.
A number of legal arrangements, including rolling-term contracts and non-compete arrangements, are employed to mitigate the risk of key staff being lost to competitors.
Information technology costs which represent approximately 11% of total costs are key to the delivery of both voice and electronic products.
The Group seeks to ensure that its systems have full redundancy and are capable of operating from business continuity sites.
The balance of costs represent premises, governance, clearing and other costs.
These represent 21% of total costs.
The settlement of matched principal and exchange traded businesses requires access to clearing houses either directly or through third party providers of clearing and settlement services.
In North America the Group is a member of the FICC and NSCC through which it clears US Treasury products, agency, mortgage and equity trades for its customer base.
In Europe and Asia Pacific, with the exception of base metal clearing on LCH.
Clearnet, the majority of the Groups clearing activities are outsourced to third parties where ICAP seeks to partner with one of the leading clearing providers in each market.
86 Notes to the financial statements continued 7 Cash Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments which are subject to insignificant risk of change in fair value and are readily convertible into a known amount of cash with less than three months maturity.
The Group holds money, and occasionally financial instruments, on behalf of customers client monies in accordance with local regulatory rules.
Since the Group is not beneficially entitled to these amounts, they are excluded from the consolidated balance sheet along with the corresponding liabilities to customers.
Restricted funds are comprised of cash held with a CCP clearing house, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, and funds set aside for regulatory purposes, but excluding client money.
The funds represent cash for which the Group does not have immediate and direct access or for which regulatory requirements restrict the use of the cash.

However, following a review undertaken in 2010 11 it was determined that the balances could not be withdrawn on a same-day basis and, as such, failed to meet the definition contained in IAS7 Statement of Cash Flows for cash and cash equivalents and it was therefore concluded that these balances should be separately identified on the face of the balance sheet and separately identified within the cash flow statement under cash from operations.
The impact of this re-presentation is discussed within the basis of preparation section of the financial statements.

88 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Borrowings Long-term borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds net of transaction costs incurred.
At subsequent reporting dates long-term borrowings are held at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with changes in value recognised through the consolidated income statement.
Transaction costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.

The Group also has in issue 300m of five-year senior notes the Notes repayable in July 2014 with a coupon of 7.5%.
The Notes were issued at a price of 99.496, and are shown net of both this discount and fees of 1m 2010 2m directly attributable to the issue.
The carrying value of the Notes of 263m 2010 270m includes a fair value hedging adjustment to decrease the carrying value by 2m 2010 2m increase relating to the mark-to-market of the interest portion of the notes.
To enable the Group to manage the translational exposure which arises as a result of the Notes being denominated in euros and to meet its risk management objective of minimising both interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on its consolidated income statement, the Group entered into a number of cross-currency swaps to convert its obligations over the life of the Notes from euros to pound sterling.
100m of the Notes have been swapped from a fixed euro-denominated coupon of 7.5% to a fixed pound sterling denominated coupon of 8.58% and the remaining 200m from a fixed euro-denominated coupon of 7.5% to a floating pound sterling denominated coupon of six month LIBOR plus 4.92%.
The fixed to fixed swaps have been accounted for as a cash flow hedge and at 31 March 2011 have a fair market value of 1m liability 2010 2m asset.
These swaps offset the effect of FX on the Notes, which resulted in a nil charge 2010 nil being recognised in the consolidated income statement and 2m charge 2010 3m charge in other comprehensive income during the year.
The fixed to floating swaps have been treated as a fair value hedge, have a fair market value of 5m 2010 11m at 31 March 2011 and resulted in a 6m charge 2010 11m gain being recognised in the consolidated income statement during the year.
The impact on the consolidated income statement relating to the fair value movement on the Notes is a 6m credit 2010 9m charge.
The fair value of the long-term borrowings is not materially different from their book values.
There are no long-term external borrowings in the Company.

The drawings under the revolving credit facility as at 31 March 2011 of 183m 2010 217m are net of capitalised fees of 4m 2010 nil.
To take advantage of lower short-term interest rates, the amounts drawn as at 31 March 2011 were for a one-week period and have been included within short-term borrowings.
The facility carries a floating interest rate at LIBOR plus 2% with an additional 0.50% payable dependent on the debt to earnings ratio.
The weighted average effective interest rate for the year was 2.2% 2010 1.0%.
The Group continues to issue commercial paper under its 500m European Commercial Paper ECP programme, providing a diverse source of finance for the Groups working capital and margin requirements.
During the year there was regular issuance, however, at 31 March 2011 the Group had none in issue 2010 45m 40m.
The weighted average effective interest rate was 0.9% 2010 1.0%.
Bank overdrafts are for short-term funding and are repayable on demand, and are generally being repaid within a very short time period.
There were nil overdrafts at 31 March 2011 2010 nil.
The Groups bank facilities contain a number of customary financial and operational covenants.
The Group remained in compliance with the terms of these covenants throughout the year ended 31 March 2011.
Under the terms of the Groups bank financings, the Company is required to remain as the ultimate holding company in the Group.
A change in ownership of the Company could result in the Groups three-year unsecured revolving credit facility becoming repayable.
The fair value of the short-term borrowings is not materially different from their book values.
c Liquidity risk management Group Through the GRACC, the board regularly reviews the liquidity demands of the Group.
The objective is to ensure that each entity has access to appropriate forms of liquidity to meet their forecast regulatory, commercial and settlement requirements.
The GRACC also ensures that the Group, in totality, has sufficient headroom to provide constant access, even in periods of market turmoil, to an appropriate level of cash, other forms of marketable securities and committed funding lines to enable it to finance its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
Maturity analysis of financial liablilities excluding borrowings are included in note 18.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had gross debt of 565m 2010 652m and cash and cash equivalents of 404m 2010 423m see note 7 b.
It is the Groups policy to only hold cash necessary to meet local regulatory, commercial, settlement and short-term working capital requirements and for excess cash to be used to reduce gross debt.
Cash has decreased from 31 March 2010 due to repayment of borrowings during the year and payment of interest on the Notes.
The Group invests its cash balances in a range of capital protected instruments including money market deposits, AAA liquidity funds and government bonds with the objective of optimising the return, while having regard to security, liquidity and counterparty risk.
With the exception of some small, local cash management balances, surplus cash is invested with strong investment grade institutions which have an equivalent credit rating of A or better and are marked-to-market at the end of each reporting period.
Counterparty limits applied are reviewed by the GRACC in conjunction with the risk function.
Although the Group does not undertake proprietary trading, it is subject to a combination of margin and collateral requirements of the clearing houses or financial institutions which provide ICAP with access to the clearing houses.
The most significant margin requirements arise in the US where, as part of its broking business, it provides clearing services to customers and is required to deposit margin with the FICC and NSCC.
During the year to 31 March 2011, these deposits averaged $33m.
Cash held at clearing houses, or a financial institution providing ICAP with access to a CCP, is now separately disclosed as restricted funds see note 7.
The deposits are met through a combination of internal cash resources and the $200m swingline facility.
The Group has no other material margin requirements on a routine basis.
To provide protection against unexpected events, the Group has traditionally maintained minimum core liquidity, in the form of cash and undrawn debt facilities, of 150m $250m.
The headroom remained undrawn throughout the year.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had committed headroom under its core credit facilities of 362m 2010 318m.

There has been no change in ratings since 31 March 2010.
Company The Company seeks to ensure that it has constant access to an appropriate level of cash and funding to enable it to fund its ongoing operations, proposed acquisitions and other reasonable unanticipated events on cost-effective and attractive terms.
If the Company has any cash, it is loaned intra-group for further investment.
All of the Companys financial liabilities are payable within three months, with the exception of a subordinated loan owed to a subsidiary of 140m which has a maturity date of 26 March 2014.

ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements Information for shareholders 01 15 17 41 43 61 ICAP plc Annual Report 2011 63 133 134 91 10 Currency and interest rate risk management The Group uses various financial instruments as hedges to reduce exposure to FX and interest rate movements.
These can include forward FX contracts, currency options and cross currency swaps.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised on the balance sheet at their fair value, adjusted for transaction costs.
Where derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting, changes in the fair value are recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, along with transaction costs.
Where they do qualify, gains and losses are recognised according to the nature of the hedge relationship and the item being hedged.
Hedges are either classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net investment hedges.
The fair values of the Groups derivative financial instruments are determined using appropriate valuation techniques from observable data, including discounted cash flow analysis, as no active markets with quoted prices exists for the instruments held by the Group.
The method of recognising the movements in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether an instrument has been designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the exposure being hedged.
To qualify for hedge accounting, the terms of the hedge must be documented clearly at inception and there must be an expectation that the derivative will be highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedge effectiveness is tested throughout the life of the hedge and, if at any point it is concluded that the relationship can no longer be expected to remain highly effective in achieving its objective, the hedge relationship is terminated.
Fair value hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as fair value hedges when they hedge an exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk that could affect the consolidated income statement.
The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through the consolidated income statement.
Where the hedged item is measured at cost, and for periods in which the hedge is shown to be effective, the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk adjusts the carrying amount of the hedged item and is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Cash flow hedges: derivative financial instruments are classified as cash flow hedges when they hedge the Groups exposure to changes in cash flows attributable to a particular asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction.
Gains or losses on designated cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, to the extent that they are determined to be effective.
Any remaining ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement.
On recognition of the hedged asset or liability, any gains or losses relating to the hedging instrument that had previously been recognised directly in other comprehensive income are included in the initial measurement of the fair value of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss in equity remains there and is recognised in the consolidated income statement when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in other comprehensive income is transferred immediately to the consolidated income statement.
Net investment hedges: changes in the value of foreign denominated investments due to currency movements are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The accounting treatment for a net investment hedging instrument, whether it is a derivative financial instrument or a recognised asset or liability on the balance sheet, is consistent with the aforementioned treatment for a cash flow hedge.
Gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income are included in the consolidated income statement on the ultimate disposal of the foreign denominated investment.
a Currency risk management Group The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in pound sterling and conducts business in a number of other currencies, principally the dollar and euro.
Consequently the Group is exposed to FX risk due to exchange rate movements which affect the Groups transactional revenue and the translation of the earnings and net assets of its non-pound sterling operations.
i Transactional exposures The Groups policy is for subsidiaries with pound sterling functional currency to hedge their main transactional exposures, which are the dollar and the euro, through a combination of forward FX contracts and options for up to two years forward.
A maximum of 100% of the forecast exposure is hedged for the first 12 months, 75% for the following six months and 25% thereafter.
The Groups other transactional exposures are monitored and, where deemed appropriate, hedged for a period of 12 months forward.
The Group has contracts in place, designated as cash flow hedges under IAS39 where appropriate, covering approximately 89% of its forecast dollar transactional exposure for the year to 31 March 2012 at $1.60.
Approximately 80% of the Groups euro exposure has been hedged for the year to 31 March 2012 at 1.16.
92 Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Currency and interest rate risk management continued ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Group is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures at the local entity level where the local consolidated balance sheet may contain monetary assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than the entitys functional currency.
It is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures using a mix of foreign currency swaps and forward FX contracts and these are designated as hedges under IAS39 where appropriate.
Balance sheet translational exposures also arise on consolidation as a result of the retranslation of the balance sheet of the Groups non-pound sterling operations, principally dollar and euro, into pound sterling, the Groups presentational currency.
The Groups general policy is not to actively manage these exposures, as active management using instruments with a shorter tenor than the underlying net asset can give rise to a net cash outflow.
However, from time to time it will use forward FX contracts, cross currency swaps or non-pound sterling denominated borrowings to mitigate this exposure.
During the financial year ended 31 March 2011, the Group designated the subordinated loan notes, the dollar drawings on the revolving credit facility RCF and an element of forward FX contracts swapping dollar receipts from drawing on the RCF into euros used to settle maturing ECP issuances, as a hedging instrument against the underlying dollar exposure.
As at 31 March 2011 this exposure was $1.4bn 2010 $1.6bn including intangible assets arising on consolidation, but before $0.4bn of hedging 2010 $0.2bn.
As at 31 March 2011, with respect to pound sterling, the dollar depreciated by 5% and the euro depreciated by 1%.
In accordance with IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, the resulting translational exchange difference is included within the 65m exchange loss taken directly to retained earnings, as disclosed in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group does not have foreign operations whose functional currency are considered hyperinflationary and would therefore require adjusting to state all items in the measuring unit current at the reporting date.
The table below shows the actual impact on the Groups 2011 results of the movement during the year of the dollar and euro exchange rates in terms of transactional and translational exposure.
Dollar Euro Total m m m Operating profit 14 16 30 Equity 59 4 63 iii Earnings translation exposures The Group does not hedge the translation of those profits or losses earned by its non-pound sterling operations.
For the year ended 31 March 2011, with respect to pound sterling, the average dollar exchange rate appreciated by 2% and the average euro exchange rate depreciated by 4%.

Where these are designated and documented as hedging instruments in the context of IAS39 and are demonstrated to be effective, mark-to-market gains and losses are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and transferred to the consolidated income statement on recognition of the underlying item being hedged.

No amounts 2010 nil were recognised in the consolidated income statement in the year as a result of ineffective hedges.
Company i Transactional exposures The Company has an immaterial exposure to transactional exposure.
ii Balance sheet translational exposures The Company is exposed to balance sheet translational exposures where the balance sheet contains assets or liabilities denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
While it is the Groups policy to hedge up to 100% of these exposures at Group level, at Company level these exposures can affect the Companys profit after tax.
At 31 March 2011, the Company had no financial assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 2010 40m euro liability.
The Company estimates that a 10 cent movement in the euro pound sterling exchange rate would result in a translational impact of nil 2010 3m on the profit after tax of the Company.
b Interest rate risk management Group The Group has an exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on both its cash positions and borrowings which it manages through a combination of pound sterling and dollar debt drawn on fixed and floating rate terms.
The Groups objective is to minimise interest cost and the impact of interest volatility on the Groups consolidated income statement.
In addition to debt, the Groups treasury policies also permit the use of derivatives including interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward rate agreements and cross currency swaps to meet these objectives.
At 31 March 2011, after taking into account cross currency and FX swaps of the euro denominated five-year senior notes, the Group had 113m of cash, 175m of floating rate debt and 88m of fixed rate debt denominated in pound sterling, 227m of cash and 307m of floating rate debt denominated in dollars or currencies closely related to the dollar and 137m of cash denominated in other currencies.
A 100 basis-points parallel movement in pound sterling LIBOR and LIBID rates would impact profit after tax and other comprehensive income by nil with a similar movement in dollar rates impacting profit after tax and other comprehensive income by 1m.
In the event that LIBOR and LIBID rates diverge, each 100 basis-points movement i. e. 50 basis-points movement in each in pound sterling and dollar rates would impact profit after tax and other comprehensive income by 2m and 3m respectively.
The details of the interest rate bearing financial liabilities are disclosed in note 8.
94 Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Currency and interest rate risk management continued Company Interest rate profile The Company is exposed to interest rate movements as a result of issuance under its commercial paper programme and loan from subsidiary of 140m.
It is estimated that the impact of a 100 basis-points movement in interest rates would not have a significant impact on the profit after tax of the Company.
Financial assets The Company is owed 40m 2010 36m of non-interest bearing balances at the year end.
Financial liabilities The Company owes 84m 2010 800m of non-interest bearing loans to subsidiaries and during the year the terms of the 140m subordinated loan were amended to charge interest at three month GBP LIBOR plus 2%.
The ECP liability of nil 2010 40m is carried at a floating rate.
The accruals balance of 5m 2010 nil is non-interest bearing.
11 Acquisitions of subsidiaries The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the costs of the acquisition are less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
When the Group increases its investment in an entity resulting in an associate becoming a subsidiary, the intangibles related to the acquisition are valued and the element of those not previously recognised as a share of net assets are recorded as revaluation gains realised in the year in other comprehensive income.
A change of ownership that does not result in a loss of control is classified as an equity transaction, with the difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is recorded and the fair value of the consideration received recognised directly in equity.
The impact of adopting IFRS3 revised Business Combinations on the Group is discussed in the basis of preparation section of the financial statements.
Where the Group has issued a put option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group derecognises the non-controlling interests and instead recognises a contingent deferred consideration liability for the estimated amount likely to be paid to the non-controlling interest on exercise of those options.
The residual amount, representing the difference between any consideration paid payable and the non-controlling interests share of net assets, is recognised in equity.
Movements in the estimated liability after initial recognition are recognised within the consolidated income statement.
Where the Group has a call option over shares held by a non-controlling interest, the Group continues to recognise the non-controlling interest until it is certain that the option will be called.
At that point the accounting treatment is the same as for a put option.
a Acquisitions in the year During the year the Group did not make any significant acquisitions.
b Contingent deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions A number of acquisitions made by the Group are satisfied in part by contingent deferred consideration.
The Group has re-estimated the amounts due where necessary, with any corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill.
Included within contingent deferred consideration are amounts which are exercisable at certain dates in the future on put options written over shares held by non-controlling interests where the Group considers it highly likely that these options will be exercised.

No further payments are to be made relating to this acquisition.
TriOptima On 24 March 2010, the Group acquired the remaining 61.78% of the share capital of TriOptima AB for an initial cash consideration of Swedish krona SEK 1,288m 119m, inclusive of a deferred consideration payment of 7m.
The remaining 7m was paid on 10 May 2010 following approval of TriOptimas 2009 financial statements.
Contingent deferred consideration is payable, in two tranches, following approval of the TriOptima 2010 and 2012 financial statements and is contingent on the business achieving a minimum pre-tax profit margin and revenue target.
The Group has set stretching revenue and profit targets for the business.
Based on the results for the year no payment fell due under the first earn-out and management still believes that it is appropriate to continue to recognise nil contingent deferred consideration at 31 March 2011 2010 nil.
c Acquisition and disposal costs before tax Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 Acquisition and disposal costs before tax comprises: m m Amortisation and impairment of intangibles recognised on consolidation 84 61 Impairment of available-for-sale assets 4 Impact on operating profit 88 61 Unwinding of deferred consideration 2 Associates 6 1 Acquisition and disposal costs before tax 94 62 96 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Intangible assets arising on consolidation Intangible assets arising on consolidation include goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets such as customer relationships, brands and customer contracts that arose on business combinations since 1 April 2004.
The amortisation and any impairment is included in the consolidated income statement within the column acquisition and disposal costs.
It is anticipated that intangible assets arising on the acquisition of voice broking businesses have a finite life.
The Group reviews the performance of the businesses and reassesses the likely period over which the acquired intangible asset is likely to continue to generate cash flows that exceed the recoverable amount.
As a result some businesses will have no impairment in a particular year while others will.
i Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based on an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices, discounting expected future cash flows to present value or using replacement cost as appropriate.
Where the Group makes an acquisition and the balances are reported as provisional at the year end, the Group has a measurement period of up to 12 months from the date of acquisition to finalise the provisional amounts where new information becomes available about facts and circumstances that existed at the balance sheet date, which could impact the value of goodwill and intangible assets arising on consolidation.
The measurement period ends as soon as the information required is received.
Goodwill is initially recognised at cost and is subsequently held at cost less any provision for impairment.
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill acquired since 2004 is held in the currency of the underlying assets of the business and is revalued at the closing rate at each reporting period end.
Goodwill acquired before 2004 is held in pound sterling and is not revalued.
Goodwill acquired prior to 1998 was immediately eliminated against reserves and was not reinstated on transition to IFRS.
Goodwill held on the consolidated balance sheet on transition to IFRS in 2004 has been recognised at its book value at the date of transition and is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures is shown within non-current assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is included within their carrying value.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998, which remains eliminated.
ii Separately identifiable intangible assets The Group has recognised separately identified intangible assets on acquisitions where appropriate.
These generally include customer contracts and customer relationships.
Intangible assets acquired by the Group are stated initially at fair value and adjusted subsequently for amortisation and any impairment.
Amortisation and impairment of intangibles arising on consolidation are recognised in the second column of the consolidated income statement.
Where an impairment has taken place, the asset is reviewed annually for any reversal of the impairment.
Any reversals of impairment are credited to the consolidated income statement.
All intangible assets have a finite life.
Amortisation of separately identifiable intangible assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Customer relationships 2 10 years Customer contracts Period of contract Other intangible assets Period of contract A deferred tax liability is recognised against the asset where the amortisation is non-tax deductible.
The liability unwinds over the same period as the asset is amortised.
iii Impairment Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
Goodwill and other intangible assets arising on consolidation are allocated to a cash generating unit CGU at acquisition.
A CGU is the smallest segment on which it is practicable to report, each of which represents one of the Groups businesses.
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations.
The Group uses a five-year impairment model as required under IAS36 Impairment of Assets unless a shorter or longer period is justified.
These calculations use cash flow projections which extend forward to perpetuity using a terminal value calculation and which take account of the approved budget for the coming year and the following two-year approved strategy.
Cash flows for years four and five rely on estimates of growth factors determined by the business.
The Group applies a suitable discount factor to the future cash flows based on its pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.
Growth rates are applied conservatively and do not exceed the expected growth in the local economy after the fifth year or for businesses which operate on a global scale, the global GDP.
Where the carrying value of the asset exceeds its value-in-use, an impairment charge is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement, and the asset is impaired to its value-in-use.
For goodwill, impairment charges previously recognised are not reversed and impaired intangible assets are reviewed annually for reversal of previously recognised impairment.
This calculation requires the exercise of significant judgement by management: if the estimates made prove to be incorrect or performance does not meet expectations which affect the amount and timing of future cash flows, goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods.

Goodwill The value-in-use calculations are sensitive to changes in assumptions used in cash flow projections and, in particular, long-term growth rates.
To determine the cash flows a five-year model base model as required under IAS36 Impairment of Assets was prepared for each business.
The base model takes into account the businesss current view based on the three-year budget and strategy.
The strategy takes into account both the strategic actions of the business and impacts associated with its external environment, such as regulatory reform.
Estimates of growth factors determined by the business were used to determine cash flows related to years four and five.
Where circumstances justify looking beyond the five-year cycle, as with Arkhe and ICAP Shipping in which the factors are subsequently discussed, a ten-year model was used encompassing the same principles as the five-year model.
The cash flows after year three, or year five where applicable, were extrapolated into the future using a rate consistent with the long-term growth factors relating to the business and economy in which the business operates to determine the terminal value.
Management has also considered performance of the business in the current year against the budget and assumptions used in the prior year impairment model.
Where results have varied management has prepared an analysis to validate resulting differences.
Where applicable, management has also looked to external support in the form of either independent valuations or market activity reports to validate assumptions used in the models.
On finalisation of the impairment testing for all intangible assets, the Group has concluded that there is sufficient headroom of the businesses within the voice broking, electronic and post trade investments and, with the exception of First Brokers and various small businesses, no impairment is required.
While Link, Traiana and Arkhe, each being comparatively recent acquisitions, have a relatively low level of headroom, a sensitivity analysis has been performed to assess the impact of a 1% increase in the discount rate, a 1% decrease in the long-term growth rate and a 5% decrease in annual cash flows.
The conclusion of which is that any such change would not be individually greater than 15m.

The Group has reviewed the computation of the WACC and, based on a change in tax assumptions related to the cost of equity, the Group has seen the WACC increase by a further 2%.
For the voice business in Asia Pacific, principally Singapore, and businesses outside the core interdealer broker franchise, such as ICAP Shipping, Traiana and Ocean Tomo, management has added a premium to reflect local country risk based on the differential between local sovereign debt rates and the prevailing rates in the UK or the risk associated with the smaller scale of these businesses.
The discount rates used for impairment testing are disclosed below.
Growth rates The valuations use cash-flows based on detailed financial budgets and strategy prepared by management covering a three-year period.
For businesses where a five-year model has been created for the Groups value-in-use calculations, a long-term growth rate into perpetuity has been determined as either: i the nominal gross domestic product GDP rates for the country of operation: ii the global nominal rates for operations which operate in multiple countries: or iii the long-term growth rate as estimated by management.
For businesses which are cyclical in nature e. g. ICAP Shipping or are still in a growth phase, the data plan is extended for an additional five years for the Groups value-in-use calculations.
A long-term growth rate has been determined based on external data related to particular businesses and factored in as part of the terminal growth rate that has then been applied in year 10.
The pre-tax discount rates and long-term growth rates used for impairment testing are as follows: Pre-tax discount rate % Long-term growth rates % 2011 2010 2011 2010 Excos acquisition of Intercapital 12 9 2 2 ICAP Energy LLC 12 9 2 First Brokers 12 9 Acquired Asian Businesses 14 10 4 BrokerTec 12 9 2 2 United Energy 12 9 2 EBS 12 9 1 1 Reset 12 9 2 Traiana 14 11 20 5 ICAP Shipping 14 11 3 2 Link 12 9 3 2 Arkhe 19 18 5 4 Ocean Tomo 14 10 2 2 TriOptima 12 n a 3 n a Others 12 9 24 12 See definitions on page 98.
100 Notes to the financial statements continued 12 Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued Link The Link business encountered challenging market conditions in 2010 as global market volumes decreased and the business saw average brokerage rates fall by 20% to 30% across all regions from continued commission compression.
Link saw the biggest impact in revenue over the summer months with revenue down in all product areas.
The business has seen a recovery in the US and the UK markets since October 2010, with the trend expected to continue and reflected in the 2011 12 budget.
The market in Asia Pacific continues to be depressed due to severe price competition and aggressive hiring by peers.
The Link business has, however, managed to successfully maintain or increase market share and, with the recent contract extension of key brokers, puts the business in a strong position to benefit from increased confidence in the market.
The base case model assumes revenue growth of 7% during the next fiscal year, 11% for the following two years and a more conservative assumption of GDP growth rate of 3% has been applied thereafter.
The base case, in line with the three-year strategy, has been prepared by each of the local regions EMEA, the Americas and Asia Pacific and therefore takes into account specific rates of recovery with Asia Pacific expected to make a slower recovery than EMEA and the Amercias.
Under these assumptions no impairment is required.
While performance has been lower than expected, Link continues to maintain its leadership position in the equity derivative markets and, as markets recover and dealer volumes increase, we expect Link will gain further market share as smaller players leave the market and volumes concentrate around the leading brokers.
All of these factors give us confidence that the business will be able to return to pre-crisis levels.
Traiana Traiana is the leading provider of post trade services and connectivity to the FX and other markets and is a highly valued asset in ICAPs portfolio.
Since the date of acquisition, we have continued to invest in growing the business and diversifying the platform in order to allow it to serve a wider universe of potential customers and markets, in particular high frequency trading, futures and equities.
Traianas Trading Relationship Management TRM and Harmony platforms are embedded into its customers systems and represent a key component of the way in which these organisations manage the work flow for the settlement of FX and as such, once installed, tend to provide a relatively stable and growing source of revenue.
Traiana has continued to expand its offering to both the buy and sell-sides, has added its first customers outside FX, in equities and futures E&F, and has launched in equity derivatives.
The Harmony Network is now processing on average $700bn of FX transactions daily.
Traiana trades profitably and generates positive cash flows, not withstanding high levels of investment in new products.
Management considers Traiana to be ideally positioned to further leverage the large and growing post trade opportunity and to continue to be a key beneficiary of market trends and changes in the regulatory landscape.
The model includes a small company premium of 2%.
Based on the above assumptions the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its carrying value.
The above differs to the impairment model prepared in 2010 which modelled the anticipated performance of the Harmony, TRM, CLSAS and E&F products on a bottom-up basis for the five years to 2015.
Cash flows were split between the more mature businesses, namely TRM and Harmony including CLSAS and the developing E&F businesses, with a discount rate of 11% applied to the former and 20% to the latter reflecting the difficulties inherent in forecasting new product revenues.
Arkhe Since its acquisition Arkhe has been integrated into our existing, and growing, Brazilian business.
There continues to be significant investment in infrastructure in order to support the long-term objective of being the leading broker in Brazil.
We have increased our market share and now rank in the top ten in each of our key markets including number eight for Homebroker and number ten for Bovespa.
We continue to onboard new customers, although this can take from six to nine months which has delayed growth trajectory.
Upward pressures on its cost base continues as a result of macroeconomic factors.
The business reported a loss during 2010 11 with a smaller loss predicted in the upcoming year.
The model for the base case scenario assumes a conservative revenue growth and an ability to leverage our infrastructure with only further modest investment to meet higher volumes.
The model takes into account the competitive landscape and economic growth and assumes that the Homebroker business has higher incremental margins, as an electronic platform, than the institutional voice broking business.
The model also considers that the voice business will increase its margin over the next ten years as the market adopts a hybrid Direct Market Access DMA Voice model.
ICAP has used a ten-year impairment model which we believe better reflects the underlying growth prospects of Brazil, in particular the growing middle class and creation of an investor class, the nature of the business and the significant investment needed to set up the infrastructure of the business.
The model assumes growth rates vary during the ten-year cycle from 3% to 8%.
The cash flows have then been discounted at a 7% premium over the Groups WACC reflecting country risk 5% and the smaller scale of the business 2%.
We expect this market to continue to be challenging, with strong competition from other players and duplicate expenses as the market continues to migrate to a larger percentage of its volume being executed through a DMA solution.
However, management remains convinced that over the long term the Groups investment in Brazil will generate significant returns and, under the assumption discussed above, the recoverable amount of the CGU is greater than its carrying value, which has been corroborated through the recent sales of similar businesses.
ICAP in ten Business review Governance Financial statements Information for shareholders 01 15 17 41 43 61 ICAP plc Annual Report 2011 63 133 134 101 12 Intangible assets arising on consolidation continued b Impairment testing of intangible assets arising on consolidation continued TriOptima On 24 March 2010 the Group acquired the remaining shares of TriOptima for an initial cash consideration of SEK 1,288m 119m and has recognised no contingent deferred consideration for the future performance of the business.
A goodwill balance of 71m 64m and other intangible assets relating to customer relationships, trademarks and software of 130m 116m were recognised on acquisition.
The customer relationships and software are being amortised over a five-year period.
This is the first year an impairment test has been performed.
TriOptima is a supplier of post trade risk management services serving IRS, CDS and commodity markets.
TriOptima is an established market leader within its field and is well respected by both the sell side and buy-side community.
Prior to the acquisition, triReduce, TriOptimas portfolio compression tool, grew rapidly fuelled by customer growth and an industry-wide focus on conserving capital and reducing operational and credit risk.
There was also increased take up of triResolve, the industry standard portfolio reconciliation technology which offers customers counterparty exposure management.
Since acquisition the business has faced a challenging operating environment as the regulatory pressures on customers has been focused on maximising submissions to clearing rather than optimising portfolios through compression.
As TriOptima is currently the only player in the IRS compression space, longer dated swaps not compressed in 2010 will still be available for compression in future years and, as such, the current year reduction in revenue is principally a timing delay rather than a loss of revenue, assuming no significant future change in the competitive landscape.
The most recent drafts of regulation legislation have referenced both clearing and compression as important tools.
This will encourage the return of volumes in compression and the take up of the service by new customers being encouraged to participate in compression by their regulators.
Increased revenue is predicted in the financial year to March 2012 as management promotes increased focus on the use of compression within the derivative industry as a whole and to individual customers in particular.
Management of the business has been restructured and aligned with selling triReduce and triResolve products and, as a result, management expects to see a change in customer mix.
ICAP Shipping Over the course of the past four years the Group has acquired a number of ship broking businesses which have been integrated to create a global platform operating across tankers wet and dry chartering, sale and purchase and derivative freight forward agreement.
The performance of the shipping industry is influenced by a combination of factors including global trade volumes, which are a function of world GDP and imbalances in the world fleet.
As a general rule, the business is deeply cyclical in nature and typically exhibits trading peaks and troughs every three to four years, as such a ten-year model was prepared for the business.
This business is no exception to the general rule and therefore we have seen our profits in 2008 convert into modest losses in 2009 through 2011 as the industry suffered from a combination of over capacity and lower global trade.
Recent activity has seen the transaction volumes climb as the industry has seen an expansion of fleet capacity.
Rates have continued to improve since the credit crisis, however dry and wet freight rates are still significantly below the peak seen a few years ago.
It is expected that freight rates will continue to remain depressed this year but recover through 2012 and 2013 but not to the levels previously seen.
Predicting the exact shape of the future cycles is difficult and will depend on a wide range of macro factors including when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development OECD countries trade recovers, appetite in China and importantly India to import raw materials and transport energy by sea increases.
As a result of these uncertainties we have adopted a conservative approach to forecasting the base case.
The model assumes that the dry and wet markets return to peak levels in 2014 15: these rates are expected to be 25% and 50% for dry and wet, respectively, of the rates seen in 2008.
The resulting cash flows are based on a ten-year model and have been discounted using a rate of 14% which includes a 2% premium to reflect the higher level of cyclicality inherent in the shipping business.
A long-term growth rate has been factored in as part of the terminal growth rate that has been applied in year ten.
This results in a recoverable amount in excess of the carrying value of the CGU and consequently no impairment.
First Brokers As noted in prior years, First Brokers is dependent on a few key brokers.
The business is expected to see a decline in projected cash flows as a result of these brokers most recent contracts being effective for a short period of time with no guarantee they will remain in the business following the completion of their contracts.
As a result, the Group has booked an impairment in the year of 4m 2010 4m.
The result of the impairment test would not be materially different if reasonable changes in key assumptions were applied.
Others The Group has a total of 5m of goodwill assets denominated in pound sterling and US dollars in which a full impairment has been taken on smaller businesses where they are no longer separately identifiable from other parts of the business or the businesses are currently underperforming and there is uncertainty as to whether these businesses will continue to operate 2010 1m.
Separately identifiable intangible assets Due to the loss of certain ICAP Shipping customers a write-off of 1m 2010 nil for customer relationships was taken during the year.

Capitalised expenditure is recognised initially at fair value and is presented subsequently at cost less accumulated amortisation and provisions for impairment.
Amortisation of these assets is charged to the consolidated income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful economic life of the asset of three to five years.
The Group reviews the useful economic lives of these assets on a regular basis.
Amortisation and impairment of intangible assets arising from development expenditure is charged within operating expenses in profit before acquisition and disposal costs and exceptional items.

Any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
When an investment is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, any cumulative gain or loss recognised previously in other comprehensive income is transferred to the consolidated income statement.
For equity financial assets, where the fair value cannot be measured reliably, the assets are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
These assets are generally expected to be held for the long term and are included in non-current assets.
Assets such as shares or seats in exchanges, cash-related instruments, and long-term equity investments that do not qualify as associates or joint ventures, are classified as available-for-sale.

This investment is not regarded as an associate as the Group does not exert significant influence on the investment, and it is included within unlisted investments.
17 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value less any provision for recoverability.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments, are considered indicators that the trade receivable is impaired.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of the future cash flows.
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement within operating expenses.
When a trade receivable is determined to be uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account for trade receivables.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against operating expenses in the consolidated income statement.
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial instruments which have a fixed or easily determinable value.
They are recognised at cost, less any provisions for impairment in their value.
Fair value through profit or loss assets are designated as such where they meet the conditions of IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
They are recognised initially at fair value and any subsequent changes in fair value are recognised directly in the consolidated income statement.
These assets are usually held for short-term gain, or are financial instruments not designated as hedges.
The accounting policy for fair value hedges is included in note 10.
Matched principal transactions are those where the Group acts in a non-advisory capacity as principal in the commitment to purchase and sell securities and other financial instruments through two or more transactions between our customers.
Such trades have no contractual settlement date and are complete only when all sides of the transaction are settled, and therefore an aged analysis of matched principal trade receivables is not appropriate.
Substantially all matched principal receivables and payables settle within a short period of time, usually within three days of the trade date.
All amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business are shown gross as matched principal trade receivables and matched principal trade payables note 18, except where a netting agreement, which is legally enforceable at all times, exists and the asset and liability are either settled net or simultaneously.
If, during the course of trading e. g. as a result of an error, any unmatched trades remain outstanding, the asset or liability is held within matched principal trade receivables or payables as appropriate and fair valued through the consolidated income statement until the trade is completed.
Deposits paid for securities borrowed represents the cash paid as collateral in a stock lending transaction.
The Group acts as an intermediary between our customers for collateralised stock lending transactions.
Such trades are complete only when both the collateral and stock for each side of the transaction are returned.
The gross amounts of collateral due to and receivable are disclosed in the balance sheet as deposits paid for securities borrowed and deposits received for securities loaned note 18.
The accounting policy for derivative financial instruments is included in the interest rate and currency risk management section note 10.
Financial instruments not held at fair value are impaired where there is objective evidence that the value may be impaired.
The consolidated amount of the impairment is calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the present value of any expected future cash flows, with any impairment being recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Subsequent recovery of amounts previously impaired are credited to the consolidated income statement.

a Credit risk management Group The Group is exposed to credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties in respect of its agency, matched principal, exchange traded and corporate treasury operations.
The risk in respect of the agency, post trade risk and information businesses is limited to the collection of agency commission and transaction fees and is managed proactively by the Groups credit control function.
The exposure to credit loss is limited to the carrying value of the receivable.
Concentration is limited since the customer base is both large and unrelated.
No significant concentrations of risk existed at any time during the year.
The matched principal business involves the Group acting as a counterparty on trades which may involve one or more financial instruments and or counterparties.
The Group manages its credit risk in respect of these transactions by having policies and procedures in place to ensure that the risks inherent in all trades are matched and that appropriate credit limits have been set and are monitored at entity, company and country level to restrict the exposure to potential loss, transacting on a delivery versus payment basis and settling the majority of trades through a central counterparty.
The credit risk on core cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments is limited by the Groups policy of requiring its corporate treasury transactions to be undertaken with financial institutions which have been approved by the GRACC and which are investment grade rated or better by one or more recognised credit rating agencies.
There were no significant concentrations of risk at the year end.
The Group does not have any significant credit risk exposure to any single counterparty.
The Groups gross counterparty risk did not exceed 22% of Group capital at any time during the year.
After taking into account the probability of default of counterparties, the equivalent usage of capital was less than 1% of Group capital.
At least 85% of the Groups counterparty risk is with institutions which have an internal rating of nine or higher, corresponding to an external credit rating of investment grade or better BBB.
The remaining counterparties are closely monitored and have strict trading limits.

The business is subject to consolidated supervision by the FSA under the terms of the CRD.
ICAP benefits from a BIPRU Investment Firm waiver from the consolidated capital adequacy tests which has the effect of excluding goodwill from the capital computation and, in so doing, allows the Group to undertake acquisitions using debt rather than equity finance.
The terms of the waiver, which runs until the end of March 2012, limits the Groups ability to incur market risk and, in effect, prohibits the Group from undertaking proprietary trading activities.
Subsequent to the year end, the FSA approved the Groups application to renew its waiver from investment firm consolidation until 7 April 2016.
The Groups Pillar 1 regulatory capital headroom represents the difference between the capital resources of the Company, on a stand-alone basis, and the regulatory capital requirements of the Group calculated, in accordance with the requirements of the waiver, on an aggregate basis.
Following receipt by the Company of a number of intercompany dividends during the year, Pillar 1 headroom increased from 0.5bn to more than 1bn.
We expect the headroom to be relatively stable due to the low amount of market and credit risk in the Group but may fluctuate due to timing of dividends.
CRD requires ICAP, under Pillar 2, to evaluate the risks facing the business and to determine whether the Pillar 1 capital is sufficient to cover any expected losses at both a Group and individual legal entity level.
The Group has developed a scenario-based model which utilises data provided by the business to assess the economic capital required to cover the expected risks and is in the process of refining this model to enable the allocation of expected losses to individual entities.
As at 31 March 2011, the Group had sufficient Pillar 1 capital to cover the identified risks at a group level and, based on its preliminary allocation of losses to individual legal entities, expects to have to increase the Pillar 1 share capital in certain regulated subsidiaries by approximately 100m during the forthcoming year with such increase being financed from existing financial resources.
The analysis of economic capital is documented in the Groups ICAAP which is required by the FSA, regularly updated and formally approved by the board annually.
116 Notes to the financial statements continued 20 Share capital continued f Capital management continued The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group meet their local regulatory requirements, while maximising the return to shareholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes borrowings note 8, cash and cash equivalents note 7 b and equity, including share capital note 20, share premium, other reserves note 21 a and retained earnings.
Following a review, cash held with clearing providers was determined not to meet the definition of cash and cash equivalents and was reclassified to restricted cash note 7 d. At 31 March 2011, the Groups net debt was 161m 2010 229m note 7 c. The GRACC reviews the capital structure on a regular basis.
As part of this review, the committee considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
Based on the recommendations of the committee to the board, the Group balances its overall capital structure through the payment of dividends, new share issues and share buybacks, as well as taking on new debt or refinancing existing debt.
A number of the Groups trading companies are subject to regulation in the jurisdiction in which they operate, principally by the FSA in the UK and the SEC FINRA in the US.
All such companies have complied with their regulatory capital requirements throughout the year.
The regulatory environment continues to change and, while it will impact how the markets work and who operates them, the Group does not expect, based on draft rules, a material change to result in its capital structure.
In general, higher levels of market volatility result in increased demand for the Groups brokerage and post trade risk and information services.
From a regulatory capital perspective, however, the impact is significantly dampened by the fact that much of this incremental business occurs in markets which operate on a name give-up basis or are cleared through a central counterparty.
Therefore, we would expect any increase in activity to have a limited impact on the Groups capital resource requirement and, as such, absent a material acquisition, loss of the waiver or a change in the basis of computation, existing capital resources are viewed as sufficient to both operate and grow the business.

The Group has applied IFRS2 Share-based payments for all such awards granted since 7 November 2002.
The fair value of services acquired is measured by the fair value of the shares or share options awarded at the time of granting and are charged to staff costs over the period the service is received on a straight-line basis.
A corresponding amount has been recognised in equity.
The fair value of share options awarded is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and takes into account various parameters, including the exercise price, current share price, risk free rate of return and the volatility of ICAPs share price.
The expected lives used in the fair value calculations are adjusted for the estimated effect of non-transferability and exercise restrictions.
A cancellation of a share award by the Group or an employee is treated consistently, resulting in an acceleration of the remaining charge within the consolidated income statement in the year of cancellation.
The total charge to the consolidated income statement in respect of employee share options in the year was 8m 2010 10m.
The fair value of options granted during the year was 5m 2010 9m.

Options granted under the SAYE are issued with a 20% discount on the market price as permitted by HMRC and those granted under the Traiana Plan were granted at the equivalent price to the original Traiana option.
The awards under the LTIP have no exercise price.
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments at the date at which they are granted.
Determining the value of a grant of equity instruments requires selecting an appropriate valuation model and estimating the required inputs to that model, including the expected life of the option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them.
The following assumptions have been applied when calculating the fair value of the options granted in the year: Weighted Probability of Weighted Expected average Average achieving average share dividend risk free Expected performance Vesting market price volatility yield rate life conditions period pence % % % years % years 2010 SAYE 360.0 51 4.88 1.49 3.1 100 3 BSMP 366.0 51 4.0 90 3 LTIP 366.0 51 3.0 100 3 Estimated share volatility is a measure of the amount by which the Companys shares are expected to fluctuate during the life of an option.
The expected volatility is estimated based on the historic volatility of the share price over the past three years to the date of grant of the option.
On options where the employee receives a cash bonus in lieu of the dividend foregone the dividend yield is treated as nil and the fair value of the option is equal to the market value of the share.

120 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Employee information and expense Payments to defined contribution schemes are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement as they fall due.
Any difference between the payments and the charge is recognised as a short-term asset or liability.
For the Groups defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each end of the reporting period.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest arising on the pension schemes liabilities is recognised in the consolidated income statement within finance income and finance costs.
The pension scheme deficit recognised in the balance sheet represents the difference between the fair value of the assets of the plan and the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in other comprehensive income, net of the deferred tax impact.
The expected return on the schemes assets reflects the estimate made by management of the long-term yields that will arise from the specific assets held within the pension scheme.
The valuation of the scheme is performed on an annual basis.

126 Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Financial assets and liabilities continued b Fair value estimation The Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value are financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, available-for-sale investments and derivative financial instruments.
Instruments included in level 1 are traded in active markets and valued at quoted market prices available in open markets.
The fair value of a financial instrument that is not traded in an active market is determined using a valuation technique, for example derivative financial instruments.
These valuation techniques maximise the use of observable market data where available and rely as little as possible on entity specific items.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
If one or more of the significant inputs are not based on observable market data, the instrument is included in level 3.
The following table presents the Groups assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value as at 31 March 2011.
As at 31 March 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Assets  3 11 17 31 Derivative financial instruments 7 7 Total assets 3 18 17 38 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 6 6 Total liabilities 6 6 As at 31 March 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m Assets  2 26 28 Financial assets at fair value through consolidated income statement 1 1 Derivative financial instruments 15 5 20 Total assets 2 15 32 49 Liabilities Derivative financial instruments 6 6 Total liabilities 6 6 At 31 March 2011 the Group determined that 9m of available-for-sale assets categorised as level 3 at 31 March 2010 met the criteria for categorisation as level 2 based on the type of information available to determine the value of the asset.
Other level 3 movements in the year comprised an impairment of 4m taken to operating profit in the consolidated income statement through the acquisition and disposal column and the revaluation gain of 4m recognised in other comprehensive income.
Company Financial assets and liabilities All of the Companys financial assets are classified as loans and receivables and the financial liabilities are held at amortised cost.
The fair value of these assets and liabilities is not materially different from their book values.
