Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies adopted is set out below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and in accordance with guidelines set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for investment trust companies and venture capital trusts, issued in January 2009 by The Association of Investment Companies AIC, except as disclosed in the following paragraph.
Expenses which are allocated to capital are available to reduce the Companys liability to corporation tax.
The SORP recommends that the benefit of that tax relief should be allocated to capital and a corresponding charge made to revenue.
This is known as the marginal method of allocating tax relief between capital and revenue.
The Company does not adopt the marginal method for two reasons.
Firstly, the Company has only one class of share and any allocation of tax relief between capital and revenue would have no impact on shareholders funds.
Secondly, the significant unutilised management expenses and interest carried forward make it unlikely that the Company will be liable to corporation tax in the foreseeable future.
Had this allocation been made, the charge to revenue and corresponding credit to capital for the year ended 30 September 2011 would have been 541,000 2010: 348,000. b Investments Investments have been categorised as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised on a trade date basis, being the date the shares are traded.
Listed investments are valued at their fair value which is represented by the bid price.
Changes in fair value are included in the Income Statement as a capital item.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors at their fair value on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
c Capital reserve The following are accounted for in this reserve: realised and unrealised exchange differences on transactions of a capital nature: realised and unrealised exchange differences on forward foreign currency contracts: gains and losses on the realisation of investments: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: special dividends of a capital nature: expenses and finance costs charged to capital as set out in the policies below: and cost of purchasing Ordinary Shares for cancellation.
d Income Dividends are recognised as income on the date which the related investments are marked ex-dividend.
Dividends receivable on equity shares where no ex-dividend date is quoted are recognised when the Companys right to receive payment is established.
Income from fixed interest securities is recognised on an accruals basis.
Other investment income, underwriting commission and deposit interest are also recognised on an accruals basis.
Special dividends of a revenue nature are recognised through the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where the Company has elected to receive dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, an amount equal to the cash dividend is recognised as income.
34 British Assets Trust plc e Traded options The Company may enter into option contracts.
The option contracts are shown in other assets or other liabilities at their fair values, being their market values adjusted for the amortisation of transaction expenses.
The premiums received and fair value changes in the open positions are normally recognised in the revenue column of the Income Statement.
However, where the options are written for the maintenance or enhancement of the Companys investments then the changes in fair value are recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
f Deferred taxation Where the year in which tax deductable expenditure is incurred differs from the year in which tax relief for the expenditure is given, the amount of the tax relief is known as deferred tax.
Since the management expenses incurred by the Company in the year under review exceed its profits liable to UK corporation tax see note 6 b, the tax relief attributable to the excess expenses, which can be carried forward to future years, is a deferred tax asset.
However, in accordance with UK GAAP, that deferred tax asset has not been recognised in these accounts since it is unlikely that, in future years, the Company will receive sufficient profits liable to UK corporation tax against which the brought forward expenses can be set.
g Expenses Expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Transaction costs incurred on the purchase and sale of investments are taken to the Income Statement as a capital item.
Other expenses are all allocated to revenue with the exception of management fees which are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
Performance fees, which derive predominantly by virtue of the Companys capital performance, are charged 100 per cent to capital.
There was no performance fee payable during the year 2010: 450,000 and with effect from 1 October 2011 the performance fee arrangement has been discontinued see note 3. h Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an effective yield basis.
Finance costs of debt, insofar as they relate to the financing of the Companys investments or to financing activities aimed at maintaining or enhancing the value of the Companys investments, are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital in accordance with the Boards view on the expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the Companys investment portfolio.
i Dividends Dividends paid are calculated on an amount per share as approved by the Board of Directors and are recognised in the financial statements when they are paid.
j Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded in the local currency at actual exchange rates on the date of the transaction or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end or, where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in a related forward exchange contract.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of a transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the Capital Reserve or Revenue Reserve depending on the nature of the gain or loss.

During this period FCIB received a basic quarterly fee, payable in advance, equal to 0.075 per cent of the value of the Companys total assets less current liabilities excluding loans.
FCIB was also entitled to receive a performance-related fee calculated on an annual basis by reference to the performance of the Company against the benchmark index over each 12 month period ended on 30 September.
If the Companys net asset value total return for any such period exceeded the total return from the benchmark index, a performance-related fee was payable, on a sliding scale, at a rate of up to 0.3 per cent per annum of the value of equity shareholders funds at the end of the period, depending on the level of outperformance.
The maximum rate of performance-related fee was earned when the outperformance for a 12 month period was 3.0 per cent or more.
With effect from 1 October 2011, the basic quarterly management fee has been increased to 0.1 per cent of the value of the Companys total assets less current liabilities excluding loans and the performance-related fee has been discontinued.
The contract between the Company and FCIB may be terminated at any time by either party giving six months notice of termination.
In the event of the Company terminating the contract by giving less than six months notice, FCIB is entitled to compensation calculated as a proportion of the fees payable by the Company in respect of the previous financial year pro-rated to the date of termination.
Basic investment management fees are allocated 25 per cent to revenue and 75 per cent to capital.
Performance fees were charged 100 per cent to capital.

6 a Tax on ordinary activities 2011 2010 000 000 Overseas taxation 235 353 The Company had 47,896,000 unutilised management expenses and interest at 30 September 2011 2010: 43,759,000.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on this amount as it is unlikely that there will be taxable profits from which unutilised expenses could be deducted.

The Companys capital is represented by the issued share capital, Capital Redemption Reserve, Capital Reserve and Revenue Reserve.
Capital redemption reserve The nominal value of Ordinary Shares bought back for cancellation is added to this reserve.
Capital reserve Items accounted for this reserve are detailed in accounting policy 1 c. Revenue reserve The net profit arising in the revenue column of the Income Statement is added to this reserve.
Dividends paid during the year are deducted from the reserve and it is available for paying future dividends on the Companys shares.

As an investment trust the Company holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Company makes use of borrowings, as detailed in notes 11 and 12, the Chairmans Statement and the Managers Review, to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances held.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of financial currency contracts and futures and options, subject to Board approval, for the purpose of managing currency and market risk arising from the Companys portfolio, and enhancing income.
Listed fixed asset investments held see note 9 are valued at fair value.
For listed securities this is either bid price or the last traded price depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is listed.
Unquoted investments are valued by the Directors on the basis of all information available to them at the time of valuation.
The market value of the Companys bonds is disclosed on page 44.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet shown on page 32.
The fair value of the bank loan is not materially different from the carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
The main risks that the Company faces arising from its financial instruments are: i market price risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest rate or currency rate movements: ii interest rate risk, being the risk that the future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates: iii credit risk, being the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company: iv liquidity risk, being the risk that the Company may not be able to liquidate its investments quickly enough to meet its ongoing financial commitments: and v foreign currency risk, being the risk that the value of investment holdings, investment purchases, investment sales and income will fluctuate because of movements in currency rates.
42 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued The Company held the following categories of financial instruments as at 30 September 2011 and 2010: 2011 2010 000 000 Financial assets Investment portfolio 413,563 457,280 Cash in bank and on deposit 10,671 7,002 Amounts due from brokers 422 1,928 Payments and accrued income 2,427 2,436 Other debtors 96 Financial liabilities 6.25 per cent Bonds 2031 59,474 59,448 Revolving advance facility 23,151 27,425 Amounts due to brokers 733 2,546 Fee due to investment manager 450 Bond interest payable 207 207 Other creditors 321 777 Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with an objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in note 9.
Derivatives may be used from time to time to hedge specific market risk, gain exposure to a specific market or to enhance income.
As at the year end the Company held no material exposure to derivatives other than hedged currency exposure as disclosed on page 47.
If the investment portfolio valuation fell by 20 per cent at 30 September 2011, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been negative 82.7 million 2010: negative 91.5 million.
If the investment portfolio valuation rose by 20 per cent at 30 September 2011, the impact on the profit or loss and the net asset value would have been positive 82.7 million 2010: positive 91.5 million.
The calculations are based on the portfolio valuation as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
The Company held the following categories of financial instruments at 30 September 2011 and 2010, all of which are included in the balance sheet at fair value: Classification of financial instruments 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Assets Investment portfolio 413,342 221 413,563 456,891 389 457,280 Foreign exchange currency contracts 33 33 191 191 413,309 221 413,530 456,700 389 457,089 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued Level 1 reflects financial instruments quoted in an active market.
Level 2 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is evidenced by comparison with other observable current market transactions in the same instrument or based on a valuation technique whose variables include only data from observable markets.
Level 3 reflects financial instruments whose fair value is determined in whole or in part using a valuation technique based on assumptions that are not supported by prices from observable market transactions in the same instrument and not based on available observable market data.
The Company holds one unquoted investment which is categorised as level 3.
A reconciliation of movements in the year is contained in note 9.
Interest rate risk Floating rate Interest payments are received on cash balances by reference to the bank base rates for the relevant currency for each deposit.

If the bank base rate had decreased by 0.5 per cent, the impact on the profit or loss and net asset value would have been a profit of 62,000 2010: 102,000.
The calculations are based on the cash balances and the revolving advance facility as at the respective balance sheet dates and are not representative of the year as a whole.
Fixed rate The Company holds fixed interest investments and has fixed interest liabilities.

In the event that the Company decides to repay the bonds before their maturity date the terms of issue may result in a penalty for early repayment.
The fair value of the bonds, based on middle market prices at 30 September 2011 was 68.6 million 2010: 63.5.
44 British Assets Trust plc 18 Financial instruments continued Non-interest bearing investments The Companys non-interest bearing investments are its equity investments which had a value of 360,023,000 as at 30 September 2011 2010: 401,201,000. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to discharge an obligation or commitment that it has entered into with the Company.
The carrying amounts of financial assets best represents the maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
At the reporting date, the Companys financial assets exposed to credit risk amounted to the following: 2011 2010 000 000 Fixed income securities 53,540 56,079 Cash at bank and on deposit 10,671 7,002 Balances due from brokers 422 1,928 Interest, dividends and other receivables 2,427 2,436 67,060 67,445 Credit risk arising on transactions with brokers relates to transactions awaiting settlement.
Risk relating to unsettled transactions is considered to be small due to the short settlement period involved and the diversity of counterparties used.
All the assets of the Company which are traded on a recognised exchange are held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the Companys custodian.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of the custodian may cause the Companys rights with respect to securities held by the custodian to be delayed or limited.
The Board monitors the Companys risk by reviewing the custodians internal control reports as described in the Report of the Directors on pages 26 and 27.
The Managers have a monitoring procedure in respect of counterparty risk which is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is controlled through the Managers process for approving counterparties, which incorporates both a quantitative and qualitative review process in order to achieve a substantial overview of the credit worthiness of all counterparties.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of such counterparties may cause the Companys ability to access cash placed on deposit to be delayed, limited or lost.
As at 30 September 2011 the Company had two overnight deposits of 6.0 million and 2.8 million 2010: two of 1.3 million each with two separate counterparties.
There were no other material concentrations of credit risk to counterparties at 30 September 2011 or 30 September 2010 because other deposits were spread over a number of counterparties.
Liquidity risk The Company maintains sufficient investments in cash and readily realisable securities to pay accounts payable and expenses as they fall due.
