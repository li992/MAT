Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to groups of cash-generating units CGUs which include the combined retail and wholesale businesses.
The key assumptions for the recoverable amount of all units are the long-term growth rate and the discount rate.
The long-term growth rate used is purely for the impairment testing of goodwill under IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and does not reflect long-term planning assumptions used by the Group for investment proposals or for any other assessments.
The discount rate is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital, taking into account the cost of capital and borrowings, to which specific market-related premium adjustments are made: per una discount rate 9.9% last year 8.6% : Marks and Spencer Marinopoulos B. V. 17.7% last year 12.9%, Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. 11.9% last year 10.2% and Supreme Tradelinks Private Limited 13.3% last year 12.6%.
The valuations use cash flows based on detailed financial budgets prepared by management covering a three year period.
Cash flows beyond this three year period are extrapolated using a growth rate of 2% last year 2%, which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the Groups retail businesses.
No goodwill impairment charges were recognised in 2010 11 or 2009 10.
If discounted cash flows for any of the cash-generating units should fall by 10%, or the discount rate was increased by a pre-tax rate of 2%, there would be no impairment.
Brands consist of the per una brand which is being amortised on a straight-line basis over a period of 15 years.
