52 Accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 13 Royalty cash flow per share 2011 2010 Group Basic royalty cash flow per share 33.11p 28.65p Diluted royalty cash flow per share 33.11p 28.65p The Groups management considers royalty cash flow per share to be a useful measure of the performance of the Groups assets.
Changes in equity market conditions lead to annual fluctuations in gains on sale of mining and exploration interests, and while these gains can be significantly value accretive for shareholders, the Groups management focus remains on increasing the Groups cash flows from royalties.
In addition, the classification of the Groups royalty instruments as repayable debentures results in cash flows which are classified as repayments until the principal and interest are repaid.
As a result, the combination of royalty income and cash received from the debenture repayments during the year form the numerator for this metric.
Both of these components are calculated before tax.
