Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently to all years presented in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Group and Company financial statements, with the exception of new standards and interpretations which have been adopted with effect of 1 July 2010 as disclosed in policy note a below.
a Basis of preparation Group and Company The financial information has been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU, and applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Based on these adopted IFRS, the Directors have selected the accounting policies to be applied, which are set out below.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of derivative financial instruments and certain financial assets that are held as available-for-sale.
The Company is taking advantage of the exemption in section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 which allows it not to present its individual statement of comprehensive income and related notes.
With effect from 1 July 2010, the Group adopted the following new standards and interpretations: IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held-for-Sale and Discontinued Operations IFRS 5 was amended to specify the required disclosures for non-current assets or disposal groups classified as held-for-sale or discontinued operations.
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows IAS 7 was amended to state explicitly that only expenditure that results initially in the recognition of an asset may be classified as a cash flow from investing activities.
IAS 17 Leases Classification of leases of land and buildings The adoption of this standard has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets IAS 36 was amended to state that the largest unit to which goodwill is allocated is at the operating segment level as defined in IFRS 8 before applying aggregation criteria of IFRS 8.12.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets Measuring the fair value of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination.
Amendments clarify the description of valuation techniques commonly used to measure fair value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination for which no active market exists.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement Scope exemption for business combination contracts.
The adoption of this exemption has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
IAS 39 was amended to state that gains or losses on a hedged instrument should be reclassified from equity to profit or loss during the period that the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Measurement of non-controlling interests IFRS 3 was amended to limit the accounting policy choice to measure non-controlling interests NCI upon initial recognition either at fair value or at the NCIs proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets to instruments that give rise to a present ownership interest and entitle the holder to a share of net assets in the event of liquidation.
The adoption of this amendment has not had a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations Unreplaced and voluntarily replaced share-based payment awards IFRS 3 contains guidance on how to apportion the market-based measure of an acquirers share-based payment awards that are issued in exchange for acquiree awards between consideration transferred and post-combination cost when an acquirer is obliged to replace the acquirees existing awards.
IFRS 3 was amended so that the guidance for such awards also applies to voluntarily replaced acquiree awards and introduces attribution guidance for acquiree awards that are not replaced.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Transition requirements for amendments made as a result of IAS 27 2008 to IAS 21, IAS 28 and IAS 31.
This has not had a material impact on the financial performance or position of the Group.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
58 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued iii Associates Associates are entities over which the Group has significant influence.
Significant influence exists when the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not control those policies.
Associates are accounted for using the equity method as described under IAS 28, whereby the investment is initially recognised at cost and adjusted thereafter for the post-acquisition change in the Companys share of net assets of the investee.
iv Employee Benefit Trust An Employee Benefit Trust EBT acts as an agent for the purpose of the employee share-based compensation plans.
Accordingly, the EBT is included within the Groups consolidated financial statements.
c Business combinations Under the requirements of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, all business combinations are accounted for using the purchase method acquisition accounting.
The cost of a business combination is the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the acquirer.
The fair value of a business combination is calculated at the acquisition date by recognising the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that satisfy the recognition criteria, at their fair values at that date.
The acquisition date is the date on which the acquirer effectively obtains control of the acquiree.
The cost of a business combination in excess of the fair value of net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired, including intangible assets identified, is recognised as goodwill.
Costs of issuing debt or equity instruments are accounted for under IAS 32 and IAS 39.
All other costs associated with acquisitions are expensed.
d Foreign currency translation The Groups financial statements are presented in Pounds Sterling Sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
i Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
ii Financial statements of foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated into Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Sterling at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
e Financial instruments The Groups accounting policy on fair value measurements is in accordance with IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and is discussed in Note 16. i Derivatives The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts and options to manage its foreign currency exposures.
Except when hedge accounting is applied, derivatives are initially recognised at cost on the date on which a contract is entered into unless fair value at acquisition is different to cost, in which case the fair value is recognised.
Subsequently they are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Transaction costs are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive income.
The fair value of the derivatives is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
All derivatives are carried as current assets when the fair value is positive and as current liabilities when the fair value is negative.
ii Financial assets The Group may, from time-to-time, invest in funds where an Ashmore Group subsidiary is the Investment Manager or an Advisor seeding.
Where the holding in such investments is deemed to represent a controlling stake and is acquired exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal through sale or dilution, these seed investments are recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale in accordance with IFRS 5.
The Group recognises 100% of the investment in the fund as a held-for-sale asset and the interest held by other parties as a liability held-for-sale.
Where control is not deemed to exist, and the assets are readily realisable, they are recognised as available-for-sale financial assets.
Where the assets are not readily realisable, they are recognised as non-current asset investments.
The recognition policy for the three categories is set out below: Non-current asset investments Non-current asset investments, relating to closed-end funds, are classified as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair value is assessed by taking account of the extent to which potential dilution of gains or losses may arise as a result of additional investors subscribing to the fund where the final close of a fund has not occurred.
Financial assets held as non-current assets held-for-sale Non-current assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell except where measurement and re-measurement is outside the scope of IFRS 5.
The relevant policy is set out above.
Where investments that have initially been recognised as non-current assets held-for-sale, because the Group has been deemed as holding a controlling stake, are subsequently disposed of or diluted such that the Groups holding is now insufficient to be deemed a controlling stake, the investment will subsequently be reclassified as an available-for-sale financial asset.
Any such reclassification will crystallise any gain or loss previously recognised through other comprehensive income within profit for the year as part of comprehensive income.
Subsequent movements will be recognised in accordance with the Groups accounting policy for the newly adopted classification.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Financial assets held as available-for-sale For available-for-sale financial assets, gains and losses arising from changes in their fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income, until the asset is disposed of or is impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in profit for the year as part of comprehensive income.
iii Trade and other receivables and payables Trade and other receivables and payables are initially recorded at fair value plus transaction costs.
The fair value on acquisition is normally the cost.
Impairment losses with respect to the estimated irrecoverable amount are recognised through the statement of comprehensive income when there is appropriate evidence that trade and other receivables are impaired.
However, if a longer-term loan or receivable carries no interest, the fair value is estimated as the present value of all future cash payments or receipts discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The resulting adjustment is recognised as interest expense or interest income.
Subsequent to initial recognition these assets and liabilities are measured at amortised cost less any impairment.
iv Hedge accounting The Group applies cash flow hedge accounting when the transactions meet the specified hedge accounting criteria.
To qualify, the following conditions must be met: Formal documentation of the relationship between the hedging instrument s and hedged item s must exist at inception: The hedged cash flows must be highly probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect profit and loss: The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured: and The hedge must be highly effective, with effectiveness assessed on an ongoing basis.
For qualifying cash flow hedges, the change in fair value of the effective hedging instrument is initially recognised in other comprehensive income and is released to profit for the year as part of comprehensive income in the same period during which the relevant financial asset or liability affects profit or loss.
Where the hedge is highly effective overall, any ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognised in profit and loss.
Where the instrument ceases to be highly effective as a hedge, or is sold, terminated or exercised, hedge accounting is discontinued.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment includes office equipment and is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
The useful life of office equipment is estimated to be five years.
The residual values and useful lives of assets are reviewed at least annually.
g Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is tested at each balance sheet date for impairment and stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill and intangible assets held by subsidiaries and denominated in a foreign currency are translated at the closing balance sheet rate.
Any gain or loss on translation is included in other comprehensive income.
IFRS3 and IAS36 require goodwill to be allocated to cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing.
The Group is considered to have one cash-generating unit and all goodwill has been allocated to this cash generating unit.
Other intangibles Intangible assets, such as management contracts and trade names acquired as part of a business combination, are capitalised where it is probable that future economic benefits attributable to the assets will flow to the Group and the fair value of the assets can be measured reliably.
Both management contracts and brand names are recorded initially at fair value and then amortised, if appropriate, over their useful lives which have been assessed as being between 31 months and 10 years.
The fair value at the date of acquisition is calculated using the discounted cash flow methodology and represents the valuation of the net residual revenue stream arising from the management contracts and brand name in place at the date of acquisition.
These are included in the balance sheet as intangible assets.
Other intangible assets held by subsidiaries and denominated in a foreign currency are retranslated at the closing balance sheet rate.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above.
i Deferred acquisition costs Costs that are directly attributable to securing an investment management contract are deferred if they can be identified separately and measured reliably and it is probable that they will be recovered.
Deferred acquisition costs represent the contractual right to benefit from providing investment management services and are charged as the related revenue is recognised.
60 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued j Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
k Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends when approved by shareholders.
l Employee benefits Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income when payable in accordance with the scheme particulars.
m Share-based payments The Group issues share awards to its employees under share-based compensation plans.
The awards are accounted for in line with IFRS 2 ShareBased Payment.
Phantom awards are classified as cash settled under IFRS2 Share-Based Payment.
All other awards are classified as equity settled.
For equity settled awards the fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of equity settled awards is measured using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
For cash settled awards the fair value of the amounts payable to employees is recognised as an expense with a corresponding liability on the Groups balance sheet.
The fair value is measured at the end of each reporting period and spread over the vesting period.
The fair value of cash settled awards is measured using an appropriate valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
n Equity shares The Companys ordinary shares of 0.01 pence each are classified as equity instruments.
Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the fair value of the consideration received or the market price at the day of issue.
Direct issue costs, net of tax, are deducted from equity through share premium.
When share capital is repurchased, the amount of consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity.
o Own shares Own shares are held by the EBT.
The holding of the EBT comprises own shares that have not vested unconditionally to employees of the Group.
In both the Group and Company, own shares are recorded at cost and are deducted from retained earnings.
p Treasury shares Treasury shares are recognised in equity and are measured at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from the sale and original cost being taken to retained earnings.
q Revenue Revenue comprises management fees, performance fees and other revenue.
Revenue is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as and when the related services are provided.
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Specific revenue recognition policies are: i Management fees Management fees are accrued over the period for which the service is provided.
Where management fees are received in advance these are recognised over the period of the provision of the asset management service, which is estimated based on experience of average holding periods for investments.
ii Performance fees Performance fees relate to the performance of funds managed during the period and are recognised at the balance sheet date when the quantum of the fee can be estimated reliably and it is probable that the fee will crystallise.
This is usually at the end of the performance period.
iii Other revenue Other revenue includes transaction, structuring and administration fees, and reimbursement by funds of costs incurred by the Group.
This revenue is recognised when the related services are provided.
r Distribution costs Distribution costs are cost of sales payable to third parties and are recognised over the period for which the service is provided.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued s Operating leases Payments payable under operating leases are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term and are recorded as a reduction in premises costs.
t Finance income Finance income includes interest receivable on the Groups cash and cash equivalents and gains on available-for-sale held-for-sale assets.
Gains on available-for-sale held-for-sale assets recognised in the year arose either as a result of crystallisation on the disposal of an availablefor-sale asset or upon reclassification of financial assets previously held as non-current assets held-for-sale as described in policy note e ii.
u Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
i Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
ii Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
v Segment reporting A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Management regard the Groups services as comprising one business segment being provision of investment management services and that its operations are not run on a discrete geographic basis.
w Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment are described in note 33. x Adopted IFRS not yet applied The full impact of these IFRSs and IFRIC Interpretations is currently being assessed by the Group: other than IFRS 9 Financial Instruments none of these pronouncements are expected to result in any material adjustments to the financial statements.
The Group continues to evaluate the potential impact of IFRS 9 on its financial statements.
Company In addition to the above accounting policies, the following specifically relate to the Company.
y Investment in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment.
z Financial guarantees Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee or that guarantee expires for any reason.
62 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements 2 Revenue Management fees are accrued throughout the period in line with fluctuations in the levels of assets under management.
Periodic performance fees are recognised only if performance hurdles have been achieved in a period.
The Group is not considered to be reliant on any single source of revenue.
During the year, two of the Groups funds provided 5.3% and 10.3% of total revenue through management fees.
Three of the Groups funds provided 19.7%, 10.3% and 5.4% of total revenue in the year respectively when considering management fees and performance fees on a combined basis.

8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit after tax for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent of 189.0 million 2010: 160.0 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated as for basic earnings per share with an adjustment to the weighted average number of ordinary shares to reflect the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
There is no difference between the profit for the financial year attributable to equity holders of the parent used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations.

The Ashmore First Discretionary Share Option Scheme Option Scheme The Option Scheme was set up in October 2000.
Options issued under the Option Scheme typically have a life of 10 years and vest after 5 years from date of grant.
The pro rata proportion of the fair value of options at each reporting year end has been accounted for on an equity-settled basis.
No further options will be issued under the Option Scheme.
The Executive Omnibus Incentive Plan Omnibus Plan The Omnibus Plan was introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and provides for the grant of share awards, market value options, premium cost options, discounted options, linked options, phantoms and or nil cost options to employees.
The Plan will also allow bonuses to be deferred in the form of share awards with or without matching shares.
These elements can be used singly or in combination.
Awards granted under the Omnibus plan typically vest after 5 years from date of grant, with the exception of bonus awards which vest after the shorter of 5 years from date of grant or on the date of termination of employment.
Awards under the Omnibus Plan are accounted for as equity settled, with the exception of phantoms which are classified as cash settled.
The Approved Company Share Option Plan CSOP The CSOP was also introduced prior to the Company listing in October 2006 and is an option scheme providing for the grant of market value options to employees with the aggregate value of outstanding options not exceeding 30,000 per employee.
The CSOP qualifies as a UK tax approved company share option plan and approval thereto has been obtained from HMRC.
To date, there have been no awards made under the CSOP.

Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year in which they are paid, or in the case of a final dividend when approved by the shareholders.
On 12 September 2011 the Board proposed a final dividend of 10.34p per share for the year ended 30 June 2011.
This has not been recognised as a liability of the Group at the year end as it has not yet been approved by shareholders.
Based on the number of shares in issue at the year end which qualify to receive a dividend, the total amount payable would be 72.2 million 2010: 64.3 million.

Goodwill Goodwill represents the amount by which the fair value of consideration paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business on the acquisition date.
Consideration represents the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred on the acquisition date.
Goodwill is carried in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount may not be recoverable based on managements judgements regarding the future prospects of the business, estimates of future cash flows and discount rates.
The goodwill balance within the Company at the beginning and the end of the year was 4.1 million and related to the acquisition of the business from ANZ in 1999.
Additional goodwill arising in the Group at the beginning of the year relates to the Dolomite acquisition in 2008.
The significant addition to goodwill during the year resulted from the acquisition of Ashmore EMM LLC on 31 May 2011 which is described in further detail in note 27.
This addition of 50.8 million US$83.5 million arising on the acquisition is attributable principally to value expected to be derived from the acquired platform through future growth and additional business from new clients, and the value of the assembled workforce.
The business of the Group is managed as a single unit, with asset allocations, research and other such operational practices reflecting the commonality of approach across all fund themes.
Therefore, no further split into smaller cash-generating units is possible, and the impairment review is conducted for the Group as a whole.
The annual impairment review of goodwill was undertaken at 30 June 2011.
No impairments were deemed necessary.
When assessing the appropriateness of the carrying value of goodwill at year end, the recoverable amount is based on value in use calculations.
The calculation is based on the forecast future profitability and cash flow projections.
As the AshmoreEMM acquisition was made only one month prior to the balance sheet date, the valuation model used for the acquisition was also the basis of the value in use calculation.
The key assumptions of the model, on which management based their 5 year projections, were a long-term growth rate of 2.5%, reflecting the expected fund flows and growth of the AuM, and a discount rate of 13.0%.
Management reviewed the key assumptions used in the model and consider them to remain valid as at 30 June 2011.
There has been no gross impairment of goodwill to date.
70 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements 12 Goodwill and intangible assets continued AshmoreEMM fund management relationships and the AshmoreEMM brand name The AshmoreEMM fund management relationships and the AshmoreEMM brand name are separately identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition of AshmoreEMM note 27.
Ashmore engaged an independent third party valuation expert to value these assets as part of the acquisition.
They were valued at the present value of the expected future cash flows resulting from the assets over their useful lives and were discounted using the Group weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%.
They are being amortised over their useful lives which were also estimated based on the work of the valuation expert.
Their estimated useful lives are 8 years for the fund management relationships and 10 years for the AshmoreEMM brand name.
The fund management relationships intangible comprises the profit expected to be earned from existing clients of AshmoreEMM.
The AshmoreEMM brand name is being actively used through the co-branding of the subsidiary since its acquisition.
The carrying amounts of the assets in the balance sheet are based on their historic costs less amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets In addition, in order to incentivise Amundi, who were formerly a shareholder in EMM, to retain existing AuM within AshmoreEMM and to further increase AuM there is an incentive fee payable after three years tied to the level of such AuM at that time.
As the purpose of this is to benefit the Group going forward rather than being a payment for past services, it has been treated as a separate purchased intangible asset rather than as part of the acquisition.

This rate reduction became substantially enacted on 29 March 2011 and as such creates a reduction in the deferred tax assets and liabilities included in the figures above.
The Chancellor also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax by 1% per annum reducing the rate to 23% by 1 April 2014.
As these changes have not been substantially enacted they have not been included in the figures above.
The overall effect of further tax reductions from 26% to 23%, if applied to the deferred tax balance above at 30 June 2011, would be to further reduce the Group deferred tax assets by approximately 1.9 million and the Company deferred tax assets by approximately 2.1 million.
72 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements 16 Fair value hierarchy of financial assets The Group measures fair values using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the significance of inputs used in making the measurements.
Level 1: Valuation is based upon a quoted market price in an active market for an identical instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques are based upon observable inputs, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3: Valuation techniques use significant unobservable inputs.
The fair value hierarchy of financial assets as at 30 June can be analysed as follows: 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Non-current assets held-for-sale net of non-current liabilities held-for-sale 46.2 46.2 26.7 26.7 Available-for-sale financial assets 41.4 41.4 6.0 33.9 39.9 Non-current asset investments 3.5 3.5 2.0 2.0 Derivative financial instruments 0.6 0.6 1.8 1.8 Total financial assets 91.7 91.7 6.0 64.4 70.4 17 Non-current asset investments Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2011 2010 m m Non-current asset investments at fair value 3.5 2.0 The fair value of non-current asset investments was assessed using level 2 inputs under the three-level hierarchy introduced by IFRS 7.
18 Non-current assets and non-current liabilities held-for-sale Where Group companies inject seed capital into funds operated and controlled by the Group, the fund is classified as being held-for-sale.
Typically, if the fund remains under the control of the Group for more than one year from the original investment date it will cease to be classified as held-for-sale, and will be consolidated line by line.
In determining whether to execute the reclassification, the Group will have regard to the proximity of loss of control, and the extent to which consolidation of the fund on a line by line basis would be material to the presentation of the Groups financial statements.
2011 2010 m m Non-current assets held-for-sale 59.0 35.9 Non-current liabilities held-for-sale 12.8 9.2 Seed capital classified as being held-for-sale 46.2 26.7 The Groups maximum exposure to credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk in respect of these assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value.
The fair value of non-current asset and liabilities held-for-sale was assessed using level 2 inputs under the three-level hierarchy introduced by IFRS 7.

The fair value of derivative financial instruments is determined by reference to published price quotations Level 2 inputs.
Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 73 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instrument risk management Group The Group is subject to business and strategy, investment and operational risk throughout its business as discussed in the business review.
Specific areas of financial instrument risk include credit, liquidity, interest rate, foreign exchange and price risk.
The effectiveness of the Groups risk management process is, therefore, critical to its soundness and profitability and considerable resources are dedicated to this area.
Risk management is the direct responsibility of the Groups senior management.
The Ashmore Group Risk Management and Control department and the Groups Risk and Compliance Committee RCC are responsible for monitoring the overall risk environment.
The Group has established a control environment which seeks to ensure that risks are reviewed regularly and that all risk controls operating throughout the Group are in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In addition, as a regulated business the Group is responsible for maintaining appropriate capital and performing regular calculations of capital requirements, including the development of an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, based upon the Financial Services Authoritys methodologies under the Capital Requirements Directive.
An overview of the ICAAP can be found on our website at www.
Credit risk The Group has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30 June 2011 and 30 June 2010 are as follows: 2011 2010 Notes m m Cash and cash equivalents 369.0 344.4 Available-for-sale financial assets 19 41.4 39.9 Non-current assets held-for-sale 18 59.0 35.9 Total excluding trade and other receivables 469.4 420.2 Trade and other receivables 14 68.2 45.7 Total 537.6 465.9 At 30 June 2011 there were nil overdue trade and other receivables 2010: nil.
All trade and other receivables are considered to be fully recoverable.
Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Trade and other receivables at amortised cost Financial assets at amortised cost principally comprise fee debtors, which are all less than 90 days old.
Fee debtors arise principally within the Groups investment management business and amounts are monitored regularly.
Historically, default levels have been insignificant, and, unless a client has withdrawn funds, there is an ongoing relationship between the Group and the client.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk in respect of fees owing from clients.
Financial assets available-for-sale Such assets comprise cash and cash equivalents, and debt and equity instruments in seeded funds.
The Groups cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits with banks and liquidity funds which have credit ratings ranging from A to AAAm as at 30 June 2011 2010: A to A.
Financial assets and liabilities held at fair value Such assets comprise derivative financial instruments with positive and negative fair values.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
In order to manage inherent liquidity risk there is a liquidity policy within the Group to ensure that there is sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12 months.
The table below analyses the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are all due within one year, except for commitments which are greater than one year.

The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Group will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
This relates to bank deposits held in the ordinary course of business.
At 30 June 2011, if interest rates over the year had been 200 basis points higher or 40 basis points lower 2010: 200 basis points higher or 45 basis points lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 7.5 million higher 1.5 million lower 2010: 6.6 million higher 1.5 million lower, mainly as a result of higher lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair value of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits.
Effective interest rates applicable to financial instruments are as follows: Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2011 2010 % % Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 0.40 0.45 Year ended Year ended 30 June 30 June 2011 2010 m m Items repricing within one year or less: Deposits with banks and liquidity funds 369.0 344.4 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instrument risk management continued Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in foreign exchange rates.

Consequently, the Group has an exposure to movements in the US$ exchange rate.
The Groups policy is to hedge this net foreign exchange exposure by using a combination of forward foreign exchange contracts and or options for up to two years forward.
The Group also sells US dollars at spot rates when opportunities arise.
At 30 June 2011, if the US dollar had strengthened weakened by 10 cents against Sterling with all other variables held constant, profit before tax for the year would increase decrease by 3.5 million 3.1 million respectively 2010: 11.1million 9.7 million.
The Group also holds a number of seed capital investments, as shown on the balance sheet, which are denominated in Brazilian Real or US dollars.
Any such seed investments give rise to foreign exchange risk.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the Groups seed capital investments are taken to equity along with the mark-to-market movements in the period.
At 30 June 2011, if the Brazilian Real and US dollar had, in aggregate, strengthened weakened by one per cent against Sterling with all other variables held constant, the impact on net assets as a result of the Groups seed capital positions would be an increase decrease of 0.9 million 0.9 million 2010: 0.6 million 0.6 million.
The impact on profit before tax would be nil 2010: nil.
76 Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Business review Governance Financial statements 21 Financial instrument risk management continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments will fluctuate because of market changes.
The Groups direct exposure to price risk is in respect of the seed capital investments it holds on its balance sheet.
These can be either debt or equity instruments, where the Groups exposure is restricted to the carrying value of the assets or liabilities.
At 30 June 2011, a 5% movement in the fair value of these investments would have a 4.4 million 2010: 3.3 million impact on net assets.
There is also indirect price risk in connection with the Groups AuM and its associated management and performance fees.
These are diversified across a range of investment themes and not measurably correlated to any single market indices in emerging markets.
Based on the year end assets under management of US$65.8 billion, and a sensible medium-term average net management fee rate of 80bps, a 5% movement in assets under management would have a US$26.3 million impact on management fee revenues.
Performance fee revenues could be reduced in severe market conditions, however, throughout Ashmores history the policy of having funds with year ends staged throughout the financial year has meant that in periods of steep market decline, some performance fees have still been recorded.
The profitability impact is likely to be less than this, as cost mitigation actions would apply, including the reduction of the variable compensation paid to employees.
Hedging activities Included within the realised and unrealised hedging gains of 1.8 million note 3 recognised at 30 June 2011 4.8 million loss at 30 June 2010 are: A 1.3 million gain in respect of foreign exchange hedges covering net management fee income for the financial year ending 30 June 2011 2010: 1.6 million loss : and A 0.5 million gain in respect of crystallised foreign exchange contracts 2010: 3.1 million loss.
Financial year ending 30 June 2012 foreign exchange options and forward contracts The options and forward contracts have been assessed as effective cash flow hedges at 30 June 2011.
Time value in relation to the Groups hedges is excluded from being part of the hedging item and, as a result, a net unrealised gain arising on the hedges of 1.3 million 2010: 1.6 million loss has been recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2011, being the movement in the time value of the hedges in the financial year.
The 0.1 million intrinsic loss 2010: 0.6 million loss on the Groups hedges has been recognised through other comprehensive income.
Nil intrinsic value 2010: nil was reclassified from equity to the statement of comprehensive income in the year.
The cumulative fair value of the outstanding foreign exchange hedges liability at 30 June 2011 was 0.6 million 2010: 1.8 million.
This treatment will continue so long as the hedges and forward contracts are assessed as being highly effective.
Intrinsic value gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as the corresponding hedged cash flows crystallise.
The hedges protect a proportion of the Groups revenue cash flows from foreign exchange movements and occur consistently throughout the year.
The maturity profile of the Groups outstanding hedges is shown below.

Ashmore Group plc | Annual Report and Accounts 2011 77 Notes to the financial statements continued 21 Financial instrument risk management continued Company The risk management processes of the Company are aligned with those of the Group as a whole.
The Companys specific risk exposures are explained below.
Credit risk The Company has exposure to credit risk from its normal activities where the risk is that a counterparty will be unable to pay in full amounts when due.
The Companys maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of its financial assets.
Financial assets subject to credit risk at 30 June 2011 are as follows: 2011 2010 Note m m Financial assets Trade and other receivables 14 143.9 69.0 Cash and cash equivalents 231.2 222.0 Total financial assets 375.1 291.0 At 30 June 2011 there were nil overdue trade and other receivables 2010: nil.
The Companys cash and cash equivalents are short-term deposits with banks or liquidity funds which have credit ratings ranging from A to AAAm as at 30 June 2011 2010: A to A.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Company cannot meet its obligations as they fall due or can only do so at a cost.
The liquidity policy is to ensure that the Company has sufficient access to funds to cover all forecast committed requirements for the next 12 months.
The table below analyses the Companys financial assets and liabilities.
The amounts disclosed are the contractual undiscounted cash flows and are all due within one year unless otherwise disclosed.

The principal interest rate risk is the risk that the Company will sustain a reduction in interest revenue through adverse movements in interest rates.
At 30 June 2011, if interest rates over the year had been 200 basis points higher 29 basis points lower 2010: 200 basis points higher 60 basis points lower with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 3.1 million higher 0.5 million lower 2010: 3.4 million higher 1.0 million lower, mainly as a result of higher lower interest on cash balances.
The assumption that the fair values of assets and liabilities will not be affected by a change in interest rates was used in the model to calculate the effect on post-tax profits.

The acquisition was in line with Ashmores strategy to grow its equity investment theme which at the year end represented approximately 15% of the combined AuM.
AshmoreEMM expands and diversifies Ashmores product offerings, revenue streams and client base both by geographic location and client type.
The total fair value of purchase consideration was 93.0 million US$153.0 million, consisting of an upfront cash payment of 49.5 million US$81.5 million, satisfied from Ashmores existing cash resources, the issue of 4,359,437 new Ashmore ordinary shares valued at 15.4 million US$25.4 million and contingent consideration valued at 28.1 million US$46.1 million.
The number of shares issued as part of the initial consideration, which are subject to certain trading restrictions for three years, was fixed at 31 May 2011 based on the average trade price over the previous ten days.
Issue costs of the shares were negligible.
The contingent consideration represents a potential earnout payable in three annual instalments in December of 2011, 2012 and 2013, dependent on AshmoreEMM management fee revenues for those years.
The potential undiscounted value of all future payments that the Group could be required to make under this arrangement is between nil and a maximum of 73.8 million US$118.4 million.
The fair value of the contingent consideration was calculated by reference to possible scenarios, weighted according to managements estimates of their probabilities and discounted using the Groups weighted average cost of capital of 13.0%.
The undiscounted value of the estimated payments is 33.4 million US$55.0 million.
At maturity, contingent consideration will be settled using a combination of cash and new Ashmore ordinary shares at the prevailing market price.
Ashmore have the option to pay up to 25% of such consideration as equity.
Acquisition related expenses of 1.3 million US$2.2 million have been charged to the income statement in the period to 30 June 2011 and included in other expenses professional fees note 6.
Tangible net assets acquired had a fair value of 13.8 million US$22.7 million on acquisition.
No fair value adjustments were made to the carrying value of the tangible net assets.
Trade receivables have not been discounted as they largely represent accrued management fees which are considered fully recoverable.
The goodwill of 50.8 million US$83.5 million arising on the acquisition is principally attributable to the value expected to be derived from the acquired platform through future growth, additional business from new clients, and the value of the assembled workforce.
No goodwill has been allocated to the non-controlling interest.
Of the goodwill arising on acquisition, 18.4 million US$30.3 million is deductible for tax purposes in the United States over a fifteen year period.
This amount excludes the goodwill resulting from contingent consideration.
To the extent that further consideration becomes payable, further goodwill will be recognised for tax purposes and amortised over the remaining part of the 15 year life of the goodwill.
The deduction for the month and year ended 30 June 2011 was 0.1 million US$0.2 million.
On acquisition, 19.2% of AshmoreEMM shares were fully vested and held by the employees and management of AshmoreEMM.
Employees and management also held unvested shares representing 17.9%.
As the unvested shares have performance conditions related to continued employment, these are accounted for as share-based payments in accordance with IFRS2 Share-Based Payment, which will result in an annual charge to the income statement in the period to vesting of 5.4 million US$8.6 million.
The NCI of 12.9 million US$21.2 million on acquisition represents the share of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired attributable to the vested shares held by the employees and management of AshmoreEMM.
The recognition of share-based payment charges over the five year period to vesting will lead to an increase of the NCI to 37.06%, although the actual percentage held by the NCI may vary as a result of the sale of vested NCI shares, the forfeiture of unvested units or the issue of further awards of unvested shares in line with the Groups longstanding equity compensation culture.
The discount applied to the contingent consideration will unwind until the time when the final payment is made in December 2013.
The amount charged to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 30 June 2011 was 0.5 million US$0.7 million.
This unwind of the discount will result in a charge to the income statement of 3.7 million in FY2011 12, 1.2 million in FY2012 13 and 0.2 million in FY2013 14.
The revenue included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 1 June 2011 contributed by AshmoreEMM was 3.9 million.
AshmoreEMM also contributed profit before tax of 2.1 million over the same period.
Had AshmoreEMM been consolidated for the full financial year from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income would show total revenue across the Group of 382.3 million and profit after tax of 208.1 million.
Subsequent Adjustment Under IFRS 3, a measurement period of up to one year can be utilised to assess the valuation of net assets acquired as the result of the acquisition.
Separate to the contingent consideration, there is a contracted adjustment to the initial share consideration scheduled for 30 September 2011, which is the only adjustment to initial consideration, goodwill and assets currently anticipated.
This true up mechanism is designed to align the upfront purchase price paid with the revenue earning capability of the underlying AuM that existed at the acquisition date.

The Group held 30.0% of the equity of an associate, Everbright Ashmore, as at 30 June 2011 2010: 30%.
The Groups share of net assets of the associates is currently below the carrying value of the investment reflected on the consolidated balance sheet.
This is considered to be a temporary position which has arisen as the associates progress through an initial establishment phase.
No permanent impairment is believed to exist and as such the carrying value of the investment in associates has not been adjusted.
No profit has been recognised in the Groups consolidated statement of comprehensive income in respect of its share of associates profit for the year as a result of the net asset position of the associates.
This treatment will continue to be applied until the Groups share of associates net assets returns to a level greater than the carrying value of the investment.
The Group has undrawn capital commitments of 21.6 million 2010: 15.1 million to investment funds managed by the associates.

It is possible that this document could or may contain forward looking statements that are based on current expectations or beliefs, as well as assumptions about future events.
These forward looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate only to historical or current facts.
Forward looking statements often use words such as anticipate, target, expect, estimate, intend, plan, goal, believe, will, may, should, would, could or other words of similar meaning.
Undue reliance should not be placed on any such statements because, by their very nature, they are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and can be affected by other factors that could cause actual results, and the Groups plans and objectives, to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements.
There are several factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in forward looking statements.
Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements are changes in the global, political, economic, business, competitive, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions.
The Group undertakes no obligation to revise or update any forward looking statement contained within this document, regardless of whether those statements are affected as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.
