Goodwill arising on acquisitions is allocated to the cash generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is determined using value in use calculations which use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management.
For the periods beyond the budget, cash flows are extrapolated using longterm growth rates.
Other assumptions such as market share and changes to selling prices are based on past experience and managements expectations of future changes in the market.
The goodwill of 10.1m is measured against the discounted future cash flow projections of our Victrex Polymer Solutions business unit.
The longterm average growth rate used was 2.5% 2010: 2.5% and the risk adjusted pretax discount rate was 7.3% 2010: 7.5%.
The impairment test results in more than 100% headroom and so it is unlikely that a reasonably possible change in a key assumption would result in an impairment of goodwill.
Knowhow The knowhow arose on the acquisition in December 1999 associated with the supply of our key raw material, BDF.
It has been fully amortised.
The charge has been recognised within cost of sales in the income statement.
