The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement and Statement of Cash Flows from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and is subject to annual review for impairment.
Goodwill is written off where circumstances indicate that the value of the underlying cash generating unit including the asset may no longer support the carrying value of goodwill.
Any such impairment loss arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods.
Negative goodwill is credited immediately to the IncomeStatement.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 that allows for the non-disclosure of the Income Statement of the parent company.
The profit attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2011 was $4,172.7m 2010: profit of $150.2m.
e Joint Ventures Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and producing activities.
Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings.
Cairns principal licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairns interests in unincorporated Joint Ventures is given on page 8. f Foreign Currencies These accounts continue to be presented in US dollars $, the functional currency of most companies in the Group.
In light of the completion of the sale of the 40% interest in Cairn India to Vedanta, the Directors have reviewed the functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC Company only.
The sale realised substantial $ income with a significant portion to be retained by the Company to finance future growth of the Cairn Group.
With an increasing proportion of cash flows of the parent company being denominated in $, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate for the functional currency of the Company to change from Sterling to $ from 1 July 2011.
In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
The Group maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, the Group translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentation currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non $ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December Average 2011 2011 2010 2010 Sterling 0.644 0.623 0.641 0.647 Indian Rupee 53.015 46.489 44.712 45.662 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 97 Financial Statements Assets and Investments: Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets This section focuses on the oil and gas assets which form the core of our business, including details of exploration costs incurred in the year, those written off or impaired and capital commitments existing at the year end.
Significant Accounting Judgements in this Section: Indicators of Impairment for Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Cairn has reviewed intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment in accordance with IFRS 6 and concluded that such indicators did exist on certain of the Groups assets.
Impairment tests were therefore conducted on those assets where indicators of impairments were identified.
Key Estimates and Assumptions in this Section: Impairment Testing of Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Where indicators of impairment have been identified on certain licences in Greenland and Nepal, there are no development or producing assets within the same operating segment to support the carrying value of the exploration costs incurred.
All such costs have therefore been impaired in full.
2.1 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Accounting Policies Summarised Cairn follows a successful efforts-based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence-by-licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within intangible exploration appraisal assets until such time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining oil and gas exploration targets is capitalised initially within intangible exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well-by-well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well-by-well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and technical feasibility for extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised intangible exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within property, plant & equipment development producing assets after testing for impairment see below.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
Impairment Intangible exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment following the guidance in IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources and tested for impairment where such indicators exist.
In such circumstances the exploration appraisal asset is allocated to property, plant & equipment development producing assets within the same operating segment and tested for impairment.
Any impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the year.
Where there are no development producing assets within an operating segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
At the year end or prior to the intangible exploration appraisal assets being transferred to assets held-for-sale, the Group reviews intangible exploration assets for indicators of impairment.
Where an indicator is identified, the asset is tested for impairment.

Expenditure incurred by Cairn India on exploration appraisal activities while the assets are classified as held-for-sale is included with expenditure on exploration appraisal assets disclosed in the Cash Flow Statement.
Unsuccessful Exploration Costs Total unsuccessful exploration cost write-offs for the year were $941.8m, all relating to Greenland assets.
During 2011, the Group drilled five exploration wells offshore West Greenland.
Three wells, the AT7-1 and the AT2-1 wells on the Attamik Block and the L57-1 well on the Lady Franklin Block, were drilled in the South Ungava Area.
The other two wells, the Gamma-1 Well on the Eqqua Block and the Delta-1 Well on the Napariaq block, were drilled in the West Disko Area.
None of the wells drilled encountered commercial volumes of hydrocarbons and consequently all drilling costs incurred in the year relating to these wells have been written off as unsuccessful exploration costs.
Following the results of the Delta-1 well on the Napariaq block, it is now considered unlikely that the Group will re-enter the Alpha-1 well on the neighbouring Sigguk block drilled and suspended in 2010.
Costs of $210.3m are included in the 2011 unsuccessful exploration costs relating to the Alpha-1 well.
2010 unsuccessful exploration costs of $304.2m include costs of two exploration wells in Greenland and an exploration well in Tunisia.
In Greenland the T8-1 and the T4-1 wells were drilled on the Sigguk block in the Disko West Area offshore West Greenland.
Neither well resulted in commercial discoveries and as a result all associated well costs were charged to the Income Statement as unsuccessful exploration costs.
In April 2010, Cairn completed an exploration well offshore Tunisia in the Louza block.
Although minor evidence of light oil was observed, the expected target reservoir was not developed in the well.
The well therefore was plugged and abandoned without testing and the block subsequently relinquished.
All related costs were charged to the Income Statement.
As $69.2m of these costs were previously impaired, the impairments were released on relinquishment of the block.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 99 Financial Statements Assets and Investments: Section 2 Oil and Gas Assets Continued 2.1 Intangible Exploration Appraisal Assets Continued Impairment Following completion of the 2011 Greenland drilling campaign, Cairn has reviewed the remaining costs capitalised as intangible exploration appraisal assets for indicators of impairment.
Though none of the wells drilled in 2010 and 2011 have resulted in commercial discoveries, Cairn remains encouraged that all ingredients for commercial success are in evidence and exploration appraisal activities are continuing to evaluate and interpret the results of the wells drilled with a view to identifying future exploration targets on these blocks.
At this time however, the Group has no firm plans in place to drill further on those blocks and Cairn has concluded that indicators of impairment do exist on non-well specific exploration costs associated with these blocks.
As there are no development or producing assets in the Greenland operating segment, these costs have been impaired in full and $74.9m charged to the Income Statement.
In 2011 a further $3.3m of impairment has been charged in relation to the Groups Nepal assets.
The ongoing political instability in the country prevents further exploration activities.
Intangible exploration appraisal costs remaining at the year end include costs incurred on Cairns Greenland licences where no drilling has yet taken place.
The majority of these costs were incurred on the Pitu Block in the Baffin Bay area, offshore Northern Greenland and on the Groups blocks in Southern Greenland where 3D seismic was acquired during 2011 and is currently undergoing interpretation.
No adjustments have been made for the Statoil farm-down on the Pitu block in January 2012 noted in Section 7.1.
2.2 Capital Commitments 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 Group $m $m Oil and gas expenditure: Intangible exploration appraisal assets 27.6 327.0 Contracted for 27.6 327.0 The above capital commitments represent Cairns share of obligations in relation to its interests in Joint Ventures.
As all Cairn Joint Ventures are jointly controlled assets, these commitments represent Cairns share of the capital commitment of the Joint Ventures themselves.
The Company had no capital commitments at the Balance Sheet date or at 31 December 2010.
Neither the Group or Company has further material capital expenditure committed at the Balance Sheet date.

This included $135.3m of assets under construction which were not yet subject to depletion.
Included within additions in 2010 was an amount of $28.5m of directly attributable borrowing costs.
In December 2010 Cairn disposed of its interests in Sangu, the Capricorn Groups sole development producing asset, to Santos.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 101 Financial Statements Assets and Investments: Section 3 Financial Assets and Working Capital This section focuses on the funding available to the Group to pursue new business opportunities and the working capital position of the Group and Company at the yearend.
Significant Accounting Judgements in this Section: Classification of Available-for-sale Financial Assets Following completion of the transaction with Vedanta, Cairn holds a residual 21.8% investment in the Cairn India Group.
As the Group has no significant influence in the financial and operating policy decisions of Cairn India following completion of this transaction, given the predominance of the majority shareholder and no representation on the Board of Cairn India, the remaining investment has been classified as an available-for-sale financial asset rather than accounted for as an investment in an associated undertaking.
Key Estimates and Assumptions in this Section: There were no key estimations or assumptions in this section.
3.1 Available-for-sale Financial Assets Accounting Policy The Groups available-for-sale financial assets represent listed equity shares which are held at fair value the quoted market price.
Movements in the fair value during the year are recognised directly in equity and are disclosed in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The cumulative gain or loss that arises on subsequent disposal of available-for-sale assets will be recycled through the Income Statement.

These listed equity securities present the Group with opportunity for return through dividend income and trading gains.
The Group disposed of its majority shareholding in Cairn India in 2011, as disclosed in Section 5.9.
The remaining minority holding of 21.8% is not held for trading and accordingly is classified as available-for-sale.
The fair value of $2,463.3m is based on the closing market value of INR 314.25 at 31 December 2011.

Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables where the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
The carrying amounts of trade and other receivables are tested at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective material evidence of impairment, for example overdue trade debt.
Any impairment losses are recognised through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the Income Statement or Balance Sheet in accordance with where the original receivable was recognised.

Financial assets are categorised as financial assets held at fair value through profit or loss, held-to-maturity investments, loans and receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
The Group holds financial assets which are classified as either available-for-sale financial assets or loans and receivables, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial liabilities generally substantiate claims for repayment in cash or another financial asset.
Financial liabilities are categorised as either fair value through profit or loss or held at amortised cost.
All of the Groups financial liabilities are held at amortised cost, with the exception of derivative financial instruments which are held at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial instruments are generally recognised as soon as the Group becomes party to the contractual regulations of the financial instrument.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 107 Financial Statements Assets and Investments: Section 4 Other Assets and Liabilities This section details our other non-current assets and liabilities, most notably the Groups other intangible assets, including goodwill, and the Companys investments in subsidiaries.
Significant Accounting Judgements in this Section: There are no significant accounting judgements in this section.
Key Estimates and Assumptions in this Section: Impairment Testing of Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the Greenland operating segment and has been tested for impairment at the year end against the estimated fair value of the exploration assets contained in that segment at that time.
Impairment Testing of Investments in Subsidiaries The Companys investments in subsidiaries have been tested for impairment by comparison against the underlying value of the subsidiaries exploration appraisal assets based on either fair value or estimated value-in-use using estimated cash flow projections risk weighted for future exploration success.
4.1 Intangible Assets Other Accounting Policies Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment on the cash-generating unit, equating to individual operating segments before they are combined into the reported segment.
Goodwill has therefore been allocated to two cash-generating units which are also operating segments combined within the Other Cairn Energy Group reported segment: the Greenland assets operating segment and the Mediterranean assets operating segment.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined by taking the higher of fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
The key assumptions are sensitive to market fluctuations and the success of future exploration drilling programmes.
The most likely factor which will result in a material change to the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is the results of future exploration drilling, which will determine the licence areas future economic potential.

During 2010, $4.4m of goodwill relating to the Mediterranean operating segment was fully impaired following the unsuccessful exploration drilling offshore Tunisia.
The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined by taking the higher of its fair value less costs to sell or its value-in-use, using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets risk-weighted for future exploration success.
At the year end the recoverable amount was determined using the fair value of Greenland assets implied through third-party discussions on proposed farm down agreements.
Given that the 2010 and 2011 drilling campaign offshore Greenland has not resulted in the discovery of commercial hydrocarbon reserves, the fair value of Greenland assets no longer supports the carrying value of the $62.8m of goodwill allocated to the operating segment.
Consequently, the remaining goodwill allocated to the Greenland operating segment is fully impaired in the current year.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 109 Financial Statements Assets and Investments: Section 4 Other Assets and Liabilities Continued 4.2 Investments in Subsidiaries Accounting Policy The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
The recoverable value of investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of development or producing oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary, or by using estimated cash flow projections over the licence period of the exploration assets of the subsidiary, risk-weighted for future exploration success where no development producing assets exist.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated short and long-term oil price of $85 bbl 2010: short and long-term oil price of $75 bbl or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3%, and a discount rate of 7% 2010: 3% and 7% respectively.

Where a disposal group classified as held-for-sale represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operation, it is presented as a discontinued operation in the Income Statement.
A sale is considered highly probable where buyers have been identified and the sale transaction is expected to be complete within one year from the date of classification.
Assets held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell.
Any depletion, depreciation or amortisation charges against the asset cease at the date of classification.

5.1 Segmental Analysis Operating Segments For management purposes, the continuing operations of the Cairn Group are organised into business units based on a geographical basis.
The discontinued operations of the Cairn India Group were a separate business unit up to the point of disposal.
The Cairn Groups continuing operations focus on new exploration activities in Greenland and the Mediterranean.
The Groups South Asia business unit holds the Groups interests in Nepal and a share in certain North Indian assets operated by Cairn India Limited.
During 2010 this segment also included the results of the Groups Sangu asset, operating in Bangladesh, which was sold during that year.
The Mediterranean and South Asia operating segments have been combined into the Other Cairn Energy Group reportable segment.
Operating segments based on the geographical locations of the Capricorn Groups Greenland, Mediterranean and South Asia were aggregated to form the Capricorn reportable segment in 2010: prior year comparative information has been restated to reflect current reporting.
Management monitors the results of its business units separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Throughout the year, the Board monitored the performance of the Group by reference to the results of its Cairn India operating segment separate from its other operating segments.
The Cairn India operating segment followed accounting policies which did not reflect the classification of assets and liabilities of Cairn India as held-for-sale.
A summary of the adjustments made to reconcile this segments results to those reported under the Groups accounting policies are included within the segmental information provided.
These adjustments include the reversal of the depletion, depreciation and amortisation charges for the period after the date the transaction was announced and a deferred tax position prepared on the basis that Cairn India was held-for-sale.
The combined impact of these adjustments is to increase profit after tax by $133.7m to the date of sale 2010: $637.8m.

The current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit orloss.

There were no major changes in the statutory tax rates applying in each of these jurisdictions, however, the weighted average rate is subject to fluctuations from year to year based on the level of profits and losses which arise to the Group in each jurisdiction.
c Factors that May Affect Future Corporation Tax Charges At 31 December 2011, Cairn had no losses 2010: $237.1m available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to UK Corporation Tax.
In addition there are surplus management expenses of $324.1m 2010: $192.3m and non-trade deficits of $66.5m 2010: $19.6m available for offset against future investment income.
None of the trading losses, surplus management expenses or non-trade deficits has been recognised for deferred tax as it is not considered sufficiently probable that they will be used.
Under UK tax law, tax losses may generally be carried forward indefinitely.

The transaction completed in two tranches: the first tranche of 10% completed on 11 July 2011 and the second tranche of 30% completed on 7 December 2011.
Total consideration received for the transaction was $6.0bn post-tax $5.4bn.
Assets and liabilities of the Cairn India Group were previously classified as held-for-sale: see Section 4.3.
Following completion of this transaction, Cairn holds a residual interest of 21.8% of the fully-diluted share capital of Cairn India, with Vedanta holding a controlling interest of 58.5%.
Cairn Indias results for the period to completion have been presented as discontinued operations in these financial statements.
Cairn announced the conditional agreement for sale to Vedanta on 16 August 2010.
Shareholder approval from both parties was obtained and, although regulatory approval and joint venture partner approval were required to complete the proposed transaction, as at 31 December 2010 Cairn believed the necessary approvals would be received and classified the assets and liabilities of the Cairn India Group as a disposal group held-for-sale.
On 20 December 2010, Santos International Holdings Pty Limited agreed to purchase the entire share capital of Cairn Energy Sangu Field Limited, which held a 37.5% interest in the producing Sangu gas field, offshore Bangladesh, and a 50% interest in Block 16 exploration acreage for a consideration of $0.8m.
As a result of this transaction Cairn no longer has operations in Bangladesh.

In accordance with IAS 21, foreign exchange differences arising on intra-group loans are not eliminated on consolidation: this reflects the exposure to currency fluctuations where the subsidiaries involved have differing functional currencies.
These intra-group loans are not considered to be an investment in a foreign operation.
Company Unrealised foreign exchange gains and losses arose during 2010 on the translation of the Companys functional results into $ presentation currency in accordance with IAS 21.
During the year the functional currency of the Company changed from to $ refer to Section 1f and accordingly the Companys foreign currency translation reserves were transferred to retained earnings during 2011.
6.2 Capital Management The objective of the Groups capital management structure is to ensure that there remains sufficient liquidity within the Group to carry out committed work programme requirements.
The Group monitors the long-term cash flow requirements of the business in order to assess the requirement for changes to the capital structure to meet that objective and to maintain flexibility.
The Board manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes to economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Board may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital, issue new shares for cash, repay debt, put in place new debt facilities or other such restructuring activities as appropriate.
No significant changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the year ended 31 December 2011.

The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using the binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
The Group operates a number of share-based schemes for the benefit of its employees.
