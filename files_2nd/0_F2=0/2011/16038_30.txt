The charges arose mainly as a result of the on-going programme to integrate BSS colleagues, systems and processes into the Group, although there was a 2.2m charge due to the closure or disposal of businesses that were determined to be non-core to the Groups operations.
2010 On 14 December 2010, the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of The BSS Group plc BSS for total consideration of 623.9m.
As required by IFRS 3 2008, 13m of costs incurred in making the acquisition and 8.1m of non-fair value charges incurred in respect of assets written out of the opening BSS group balance sheet were charged to the income statement as exceptional items and included in administrative expenses.
Offset against the exceptional charge was the release of 2.1m of onerous lease provisions, which were originally established in 2008 as exceptional charges to the income statement.
The net total of exceptional items was 19.0m.
13.4m of costs incurred in making the acquisition of BSS were charged to the Companys income statement in 2010 as an exceptional item and included in administrative expenses.
To enable readers of the financial statements to obtain a clear understanding of underlying trading, the Directors have shown the exceptional items separately in the group income statement.

6. Business and geographical segments As required by IFRS 8 the operating segments are identifi ed on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to assess their performance.
For management purposes, during 2011 the Group was organised into three operating divisions Merchanting, Retailing and BSS, which operate mainly in the United Kingdom.
It is on this basis that we report in the 2011 Annual Report and Accounts.
On 1 January 2012 the Group was reorganised into four divisions, General Merchanting, Specialist Merchanting, Consumer and Plumbing and Heating.
In 2012, we will report segmental information on the basis of the new divisional structure.
Segment profit represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of share of losses of associates, finance income and costs and income tax expense.
During 2011 and 2010, other than in respect of fair value adjustments and exceptional charges made in respect of BSS assets, there were no impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses recognised in profit or loss or in equity in any of the reportable segments.

Pension arrangements Defi ned benefi t schemes Prior to the acquisition of The BSS Group plc, the Group operated one fi final salary scheme: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefi t Scheme the TP scheme, which for the majority of members is a 1 60th scheme.
The TP scheme is funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
Contributions are paid to the Trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualifi ed actuary who carries out a valuation of the scheme every three years.
Employees are entitled to start drawing a pension, based on their membership of the scheme, on their normal retirement date.
If employees choose to retire early and draw their pension, then the amount they receive is scaled down accordingly.
A full actuarial valuation of the TP scheme was carried out on 30 September 2008.
The full actuarial valuation as at 30 September 2011 is currently in progress.
The IAS 19 valuation has been based upon the results of the 30 September 2008 valuation, then updated to 31 December 2011 by a qualified actuary.
The present values of the defined obligations, the related current service costs and the past service costs for the scheme were measured using the projected unit method.
Following the acquisition of The BSS group plc the Group now operates three additional defined benefit pension schemes the BSS schemes based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of the schemes trustees.
All defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the scheme assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligation were carried out at 1 June 2009 for the main UK and Irish schemes and 31 December 2008 for the secondary UK scheme.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation, and the related current service cost and past service cost, were measured using the projected unit method with a control period equal to the future working lifetime of the active members.
In June 2010 an agreement was reached with the trustees of the Travis Perkins final salary pension scheme to fund 34.7m of the deficit using a group controlled special purpose vehicle.
The pension scheme will be entitled to receive the income of the SPV for a period of up to 20 years, subject to funding levels.
This income is backed by the security of 16 Travis Perkins freehold properties.

Share-based payments The following disclosures relate to share option and SAYE grants made after 7 November 2002.
The Black-Scholes option-pricing model is used to calculate the fair value of the options and the amount to be expensed.
The probability of the performance conditions being achieved was included in the fair value calculations.
The inputs into the model for options granted in the year expressed as weighted averages are as follows: 2011 2010 Nil price Nil price SAYE options SAYE options Share price at grant date pence - Group 833 975 819 734 Option exercise price pence - Group 657 - 691 - Share price at grant date pence - Company 833 975 819 734 Option exercise price pence - Company 657 - 691 - Volatility % Group and Company 48.6% 61.4% 59.5% 62.1% Option life years Group and Company 3.5 3.0 3.5 3.0 Risk-free interest rate % Group and Company 0.9% 1.7% 1.6% 1.3% Expected dividends as a dividend yield % Group and Company 1.8% 1.9% 0.6% 0.6% Volatility was based on historic share prices over a period of time equal to the vesting period.
Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 or 5 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of 3 times.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based upon managements best estimate, for the effect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
SAYE options were granted on 1 December 2011.
The estimated fair value of the shares at that date was 10.4m for the Group and 0.1m for the Company.
Shares were granted under the share-matching scheme on 15 March, 6 September and 7 December 2011.
The estimated fair value of the shares at those dates was 4.2m for the Group and 2.1m for the Company.
Shares were granted under the performance share plan on 4 March, 4 April, 21 June and 19 August 2011.
The estimated fair value of the shares at those dates was 7.0m for the Group and 4.6m for the Company.
Shares were granted under the deferred share bonus plan on 2 March 2011.
The estimated fair value of the shares at that date was 1.1m for the Group and 0.5m for the Company.
The Group charged 13.9m 2010: 8.0m and the Company charged 5.1m 2010: 2.3m to the income statement in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions.

Adjusted interest cover is calculated by dividing, adjusted operating profit of 313.2m 2010: 239.0m less 1.5m 2010: 1.2m of specifically excluded IFRS adjustments, by the combined value of interest on bank loans and overdrafts excluding amortised bank finance charges, other interest payable and interest receivable, which total 20.3m 2010: 12.6m.
The unwinding of the discounts charge arises principally from the property provisions created in 2008 and the pensions SPV.
During 2011 the Group repaid $125m of the BSS unsecured senior notes and terminated the associated derivatives.
This resulted in a net loss of 4.4m, which is shown as exceptional.
Included within finance costs in 2010 is an exceptional charge of 0.7m due to writing off unamortised bank fees in respect of the BSS loan facility, which was repaid following the acquisition.

99 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements 14.
Goodwill continued The Group tests goodwill and other non monetary assets for impairment annually or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and forecast cash flows during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The turnover growth rates in each CGU are based on the Directors forecasts for the next 1 to 4 years.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs used in the calculations are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
At the beginning and end of the financial period the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets in all segments was in excess of their book value.
The Directors calculations have shown that no impairments have occurred.
The key assumptions applied in the value in use calculations were: Cash flow forecasts which were derived from the most recent financial budgets and plans, which were approved by the directors.
Cash flows for the following year are extrapolated from cash flows produced for the budget period using similar assumptions to those applied to the final year of the budget: The weighted average cost of capital WACC of the Group, which is used as the discount rate, is 6.9%, which is not significantly different for any individual CGU: Long-term forecast growth rates of 2.5% in line with the average long-term GDP growth trend applied from 2017 onwards.
Whilst management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible that an impairment would be identifi ed if any of the above key assumptions were changed signifi cantly.
For instance factors which could cause an impairment are: Significant underperformance relative to the forecast results: Changes to the way the assets are used or changes to the strategy for the business: A deterioration in the industry or in the economy.
The impairment review calculations are based upon anticipated discounted future cash fl ows.
These calculations are sensitive to changes in future cash fl ows, the discount rate applied and the terminal growth rate.

The average credit term taken for sales of goods is 55 days 2010: 55 days.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts of 54.5m 2010: 44.4m, estimated by the Groups management based on prior experience and their assessment of the current economic environment.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair values.
No interest is charged on the trade receivable from the date of the invoice until the date the invoice is classified as overdue according to the trading terms agreed between the Group and the customer.
Thereafter, the Group retains the right to charge interest between 2% to 4% above the clearing bank base rate per annum on the outstanding balance.
The business has provided fully for all receivables outstanding for more than 90 days beyond agreed terms.
Trade receivables not receivable for up to 90 days are specifically provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts.

The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that no further credit provision is required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are unprovided against debtors with a carrying amount of 65.9m 2010: 70.4m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not identified a significant change in credit quality and as such, the Group considers that the amounts are still recoverable.

The following table provides an analysis of fi financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fi xed and fl oating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts and forward interest rate contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defi ned risk appetite, ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
Interest rate swaps The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that its exposure to changes in interest rates on borrowings either is on a fi xed rate basis or is subject to movements within pre-defi ned limits.
To achieve its desired interest rate profi le the Group uses interest rate swaps.
As part of their interest rate management processes, in respect of the facilities described in note 24, the Group and the Company at the commencement of the year were parties to four amortising swaps each with an initial notional value of 100m, two amortising swaps with an initial notional value of 50m and two non amortising swaps each with a notional value of 50m, all expiring on 11 May 2011.
On the 11 May 2011, the Group and the Company entered into five amortising swaps each with an initial notional value of 45m.
Contracts with notional values of 200m are designated as cash flow hedges with fixed interest payments at an average rate of 1.71% for periods up until May 2014 and have floating interest receipts equal to 1 month LIBOR.
The non-amortising interest rate swap with a call option has a notional value of 50m with fixed interest payments at a rate of 4.595% for periods up until October 2013 and has floating interest payments equal to 6 month LIBOR.
At 31 December 2011 the fair value of interest rate derivatives, all of which terminate before three years from the balance sheet date, to which the Group and the Company were parties was estimated at 5.9m 2010: 5.7m.
This amount is based on market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps excluding those with a call option are designated and effective as cash flow hedges and the fair value thereof has been deferred in equity.
A credit of 0.9m 2010: charge 0.7m in respect of the fair value movement on interest rate swaps with a call option has been taken to the income statement through net finance charges as the Group has not applied hedge accounting.
111 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Financial Statements 25.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate swap contracts Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fi xed and fl oating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fi xed rate debt held and the cash fl ow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash fl ows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the fi financial year.
The following table details the notional principal amounts and remaining terms of interest rate swap contracts as at the reporting date: Cash fl ow hedges outstanding receive fl oating pay fi xed contracts Average contract fi xed interest rate Notional principle amount Fair value 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % m m m m Less than 1 year - 1.52% - 400.0 - 1.6 2 to 5 years 1.17% - 200.0 - 2.6 - Greater than 5 years - 5.40% - 29.0 - 2.5 200.0 429.0 2.6 0.9 The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The fl oating rate on the interest rate swaps is 1 month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fi xed and fl oating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging fl oating rate interest amounts for fi xed rate interest amounts are designated as cash fl ow hedges in order to reduce the Groups cash fl ow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.
The interest rate swaps and the interest rate payments on the loan occur simultaneously and the amount deferred in equity is recognised in the income statement over the period that the fl oating rate interest payments on debt affect profi t or loss.
e Currency swaps and currency forward contracts In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the $400m unsecured senior notes described in note 24 i the Group and Company has four cross currency swaps in varying amounts between 23m and 58m to fi x the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire lives of $290m of the unsecured loan notes.
The forward options fi xed the notional amount receivable and payable in respect of the unsecured senior notes to 168m as well as fi xing the exchange rate applicable to future coupon payments.
The Group and the Company has three forward contracts with a notional value of $30m each and one with a notional value of 20m to hedge $110m of unsecured senior notes.
These contracts have a maturity date of January 2016.
At 31 December 2011 the fair value of these forward contracts was estimated at 0.1m 2010: 0.3m.
The interest rate swaps settle on a half-yearly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is 6 months LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest on a net basis.
The currency swaps manage the Groups and the Companys exposure to the fixed interest rate on the US dollar denominated borrowing arising out of a private placement on 26 January 2006.
There are two interest rate swaps of 58m that convert the borrowing rate on $200m of debt from 5.77% to a variable rate on 6 month LIBOR plus a weighted average basis point increment of 81.9.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were both at 5.43%.
A further two interest rate swaps of 29m and 23m convert the borrowing rates on US$50m, US$40m of debt from 5.89% to a variable rate based on six month LIBOR plus basis point increment of 86.5 and 86.7 respectively.
At 26 January 2006 the variable rates were at weighted average 5.47%.
In order to eliminate the currency risk associated with the BSS private placement of $125m The BSS Group plc entered into three cross currency interest rate swaps to fix the exchange rate at 1 equal to $1.73 for the entire duration of the private placement.
The private placement was repaid in June and July 2011 and consequently all three cross currency swaps were settled.
The aggregate net loss from these transactions was 4.4m, which is shown as an exceptional item.
During 2010 the Group and Company novated one cross currency interest rate swap with a notional value of $110m and a sterling equivalent of 63m for total proceeds of 13.7m in the Group and 16.3m in the Company.
The proceeds are being amortised to the income statement over the remaining life of the unsecured senior notes.

Financial instruments continued Interest rate swap contracts exchanging fi xed rate interest for fl oating rate interest are designated and effective as fair value hedges in respect of interest rates.
During the period, the hedge was 100% effective in hedging the fair value exposure to interest movements and as a result, the carrying amount of the loan was adjusted by 36.9m 2010: 38.4m, which was included in the income statement at the same time that the fair value of the interest rate swap was included in the income statement.
The Group acquires goods for sale from overseas, which when not denominated in Sterling are paid for principally in US dollars.
The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts all of which are less than one year in duration to buy US dollars to hedge the exchange risk arising from these anticipated future purchases.
At the balance sheet date the total notional value of contracts to which the Group was committed was US$120.3m 2010: US$93.6m.
The fair value of these derivatives is 3.1m 2010: [0.9m].
These contracts have not been designated as hedges and accordingly the fair value movement has been reflected in the income statement.
f Liquidity analysis The following table details the Groups liquidity analysis for its derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities.
The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash inflows outflows on the derivative instrument that settle on a net basis and the undiscounted gross inflows and outflows on those derivatives that require gross settlement.
When the amount payable or receivable is not fixed, the amount disclosed has been determined by reference to the projected interest and foreign currency rates as illustrated by the yield curves existing at the reporting date.
Financial instruments continued g Interest rate sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative fi financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
For fl oating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming that the amount of liability outstanding at the balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year.
A 1.0% increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management personnel.
If interest rates had been 1.0% higher lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups: Profit before taxation for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have decreased increased by 2.1m 2010: increased decreased by 0.2m including 0.7m 2010: 1m of movement on interest rate swaps with options: Net equity would have increased decreased by 0.6m 2010: increased decreased by 0.2m mainly because of the changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the increase in the nominal value of interest rate derivatives.
h The Company On 15th October 2010, as part of financing arrangements in relation to the proposed reorganisation and integration of the Groups plumbing and heating businesses, the Company agreed to pay amounts equal to a proportion of future US$ receipts under certain cross currency interest rate swaps to a subsidiary, as part of a contribution agreement entered into with it and a further subsidiary of the Company.
The maximum amounts payable under the contribution agreement would have been US$273m.
This transaction resulted in the derecognition of the fair value of these future US$ receipts from the balance sheet of the company.
On 8th December 2011 it was agreed by all relevant parties to terminate this contribution agreement early.
As a result of this early termination the Company has made a payment to its subsidiary of 168.2m in full and final settlement of the contribution agreement.
As a result of this early termination the Company has re-recognised the fair value of the US$ amounts receivable on the $273m cross currency interest rate swaps in its balance sheet from the date of termination, and has designated the swaps as a fair value hedge of the relevant proportion of the Companys US$ private placement debt.
Also on 8 December 2011 the Company agreed with another of its subsidiaries to redenominate an investment by the company in US$ preference shares with a value of $273m to their sterling equivalent.
As well as this redenomination, the preference shares were converted to ordinary shares ranking equally with its existing investment in the ordinary shares of the subsidiary.
Up to the date of redenomination and conversion the Company received accrued preference dividends of 9.2m and made a retranslation loss of 0.6m, both of which have been recognised in the Companys income statement.

Provisions continued It is Group policy to substantially self insure itself against claims arising in respect of damage to assets, or due to employers or public liability claims.
The nature of insurance claims means they may take some time to be settled.
The insurance claims provision represents managements best estimate, based upon external advice of the value of outstanding insurance claims where the final settlement date is uncertain.

The table has been drawn up based on the undiscounted net cash outflows.
Deferred tax The following are the major deferred tax liabilities and assets recognised by the Group and movements thereon during the current and prior reporting periods.
