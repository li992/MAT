Financial Risk Management policies and procedures The Company invests in equities and other investments in accordance with its investment objective as stated on page 2.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to certain inherent risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for distribution by way of dividends.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are: market risk price and yield, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors determine the objectives and agree policies for managing each of these risks, as set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Directors, implement the Companys risk management policies.
The Companys policy allows the use of derivative financial instruments to moderate risk exposure and to generate additional revenue.
These policies have remained unchanged during the current and preceding period.
Market Risk The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision, and monitors the risk on the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
Market risk comprises market price risk price and yield, foreign currency risk and interest rate risk.
i Market Price Risk Market price risk arises mainly from the uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
Where call options are sold written, in all cases a sufficient position is maintained in the underlying equity to cover any potential option exercise.
Whilst the option value can be volatile, price movements should to some extent be offset by opposing movements in the value of the underlying 44 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2011 equity.
If options are retained until expiry they will either expire worthless or be exercised.
The effect of any option exercise is to sell the underlying shares at the strike price of the option.
A schedule of the Companys listed holdings is shown on pages 13 and 14.
Where put options are purchased, the market value of such options can be volatile but the maximum realised loss on any contract is limited to the original investment cost.
Further explanation of this derivative strategy is included in the Investment Managers Review on pages 10 and 11.
Falls in stock market valuations lead to changes in gearing ratios.
The Boards procedure for monitoring the gearing of the Company is set out in Note 18 on page 49.
This takes into account the Investment Managers view on the market, covenant requirements and the future prospects of the Companys performance.
Market price risk sensitivity The value of the Companys listed investments i. e fixed asset investments, excluding unlisted equities which were exposed to market price risk as at 31 January 2011 was as follows: 2011 2010 Listed investments held at fair value through profit or loss 543,212,051 488,287,091 Derivative financial instruments purchased put options 83,125 Derivative financial instruments written call options 307,947 101,850 Total listed investments 542,904,104 488,268,366 The following illustrates the sensitivity of the return and the net assets to an increase or decrease of 20% 2010 20% in the fair values of the Companys listed investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of market conditions in the year.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the impact of a change to the value of the Companys listed equity investments at each balance sheet date and the consequent impact on the investment management fees for the year, with all other variables held constant.
2011 2011 2010 2010 20% Increase 20% Decrease 20% Increase 20% Decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value Revenue return Investment management fees 133,087 133,087 119,626 119,626 Capital return Net gains losses on investments at fair value 108,580,821 108,580,821 97,653,673 97,653,673 Investment management fees 247,161 247,161 222,162 222,162 Change in net return and net assets 108,200,573 108,200,573 97,311,885 97,311,885 Management of market price risk The Directors meet regularly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
A dedicated investment manager has the responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selection in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Call options are only written on stock owned within the portfolio with a maximum exposure of 20% of gross assets at the time of writing.
ii Market Yield Risk Market yield risk arises from the uncertainty about the Companys ability to maintain its income objectives due to systematic decline in corporate dividend levels.
Management of market yield risk The Directors regularly review the current and projected yield of the investment portfolio, and discuss with the investment Manager the extent to which it will enable the Company to meet its investment income objective.
iii Foreign Currency Risk Foreign currency risk is the risk of the movement in the values of overseas financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates.
45 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2011 Management of foreign currency risk The Company invests predominantly in UK listed equities and has no significant exposure to currencies other than sterling 2010 no significant exposure.
Any income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
iv Interest Rate Risk Interest rate risk is the risk of movements in the value of financial instruments as a result of fluctuations in interest rates.
Interest Rate Exposure The table below summarises in sterling terms the financial assets and financial liabilities whose values are directly affected by changes in interest rates.
The fixed rate interest bearing liabilities bear the following coupon and effective rates as at 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2010.
Amount Effective Maturity borrowed Coupon rate since date Rate inception First Debenture Finance PLC FDF Loan Notes and Bonds 02 01 2018 25,667,599 14.75% 11.28% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust Original Loan 20 11 2023 30,000,000 9.25125% 9.51% Fintrust Debenture PLC Fintrust New Loan 20 11 2023 12,000,000 9.25125% 6.00% 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 20 12 2029 30,000,000 5.875% 6.23% 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock n a 1,375,000 4.00% 4.00% 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock n a 1,178,000 3.65% 3.65% 100,220,599 The effective rates are calculated in accordance with FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as detailed in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
The details in respect of the above loans have remained unchanged since the previous accounting period.
The weighted average effective rate of the Companys fixed interest bearing liabilities excluding the 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock and the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock is 8.54% 2010 8.54% and the weighted average period to maturity of these liabilities is 13.2 years 2010 14.2 years.
46 The Merchants Trust PLC Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 January 2011 The above year end amounts are reasonably representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year, as the level of exposure does not change materially.
The Companys net return and net assets are not significantly affected by changes in interest rates.
Management of interest rate risk The Company invests predominantly in equities, the values of which are not directly affected by changes in prevailing market interest rates.
In the year to 31 January 2011, the Company held no fixed interest securities.
The Companys policy is to remain substantially fully invested and does not expect to hold significant cash balances.
The financial assets therefore have minimal exposure to interest rate risk.
The Company finances its operations through a mixture of share capital, retained revenue return and long term borrowings.
Movement in interest rates will not have a material effect on the finance costs and financial liabilities of the Company as all the borrowings of the Company are subject to fixed rates of interest.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk relates to the capacity to meet liabilities as they fall due and is dependent on the liquidity of the underlying assets.
Maturity of financial liabilities The table below presents the future cash flows payable by the Company in respect of its financial liabilities.
Cash flows in respect of the principal and interest on the Stepped Rate Interest Loan, Fixed Rate Interest Loan and 5.875% Secured Bonds 2029 reflect the maturity dates as set out in Note 10 on page 42.
Cash flows in respect of the 4% Perpetual Debenture Stock and 3.65% Cumulative Preference Stock, which have no fixed repayment date, assume maturity of 20 years from the balance sheet date.
Cash flows have not been discounted.

Short term flexibility can be achieved through the use of overdraft facilities, where necessary.
As at the 31 January 2011, the Company had an undrawn committed borrowing facility of 10 million 2010 10 million.
Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of default by a counterparty to discharge its obligations under transactions that could result in the Company suffering a loss.
Management of credit risk Outstanding settlements are subject to credit risk.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Company through its decision to transact with counterparties of high credit quality.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which are considered to be approved counterparties, thus minimising the risk of default during settlement.
The Company is also exposed to credit risk through the use of banks for its cash position.
Bankruptcy or insolvency of banks may cause the Companys rights with respect to cash held by banks to be delayed or limited.
The Companys cash balances are held by HSBC Bank PLC, rated Aa2 by Moodys rating agency.
The Directors believe the counterparties the Company has chosen to transact with are of high credit quality, therefore the Company has minimal exposure to credit risk.
The table below summarises the credit risk exposure of the Company as at 31 January: 2011 2010 Debtors: Outstanding settlements 2,281,965 Accrued income 1,995,817 1,360,380 Other debtors 38,513 38,977 Cash at bank 9,257,041 8,911,182 11,291,371 12,592,504 Fair Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities With the exception of those financial liabilities measured at amortised cost, the financial assets and financial liabilities are either carried at their fair value, or the balance sheet amount is considered to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
The fair value has been derived from the closing market value of the debt and accrued interest as at 31 January 2011 and 31 January 2010.
FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures has been expanded to include a fair value hierarchy for the disclosure of fair value measurement of financial instruments.
