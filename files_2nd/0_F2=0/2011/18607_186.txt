As a result of this valuation the group agreed a recovery plan with the Trustees to run over seven years to pay annual deficit contributions of 580,200.
Based on this plan In addition to the above the group has a contingent tax liability representing the difference between the carrying value of trading the company expects to pay 597,000 including the standard expense charges payable under the Managed Fund policy, to the scheme properties in the balance sheet and their market value.
This contingent tax, which is not provided in the accounts, amounts to 84.9m during the year beginning 1 October 2011.

However, given the Life expectancies increased by one year increase in deficit of 0.7m long-term nature of our property ownership, we anticipate that the balance will predominantly be crystallised in a period greater than one year.
