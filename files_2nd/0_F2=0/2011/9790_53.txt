As such, the partnership is consolidated into the results of the Group.
The Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership holds 1.5bn of properties which have been leased back to Marks and Spencer plc at market rates.
The Group retains control over these properties, including the flexibility to substitute alternative properties.
The limited partnership interest held by the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme entitles the Pension Scheme to receive an annual distribution of 71.9m from the profits of the Partnership earned from rental income, discretionary at the instance of Marks and Spencer plc.
The discretionary right is exercisable if the Group does not pay a dividend or make any other form of return to its shareholders.
This is an equity instrument, disclosed within other reserves.
Since the Group has paid an interim dividend in relation to 2010 11, the associated distribution of 71.9m is payable to the Pension Scheme and has been recognised as a liability last year 71.9m, and is reflected as reduction in other reserves.
When such reserves are no longer sufficient, this distribution will be charged to retained earnings.
The future value of total discretionary scheduled payments is approximately 791m last year 862m.
Under IAS 19, the partnership interest of the Pension Scheme in the Marks and Spencer Scottish Limited Partnership is included within the UK pension scheme assets, valued at 656.0m last year 631.7m.
