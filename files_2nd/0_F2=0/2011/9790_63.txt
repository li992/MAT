23 Financial instruments Treasury policy and financial risk management The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
Group treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages: To nd out more visit marksandspencer.
