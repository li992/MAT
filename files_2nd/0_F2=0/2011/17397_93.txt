Share-based payments Long Term Incentive Plans Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2006 onwards A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
There are different performance targets for different categories of management.
Awards made to executive directors and senior employees have 50% of the award subject to the Companys total shareholder return TSR performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250 Index excluding investment trusts at the start of the performance period.
Full vesting of this portion of the award will take place if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile and 30% vesting will be achieved with a median ranking, with pro-rata vesting for intermediate performance.
No vesting will occur for a ranking below median.
The remaining 50% of the award made to executive directors and senior employees is subject to the Companys real growth in normalised earnings per share EPS over the performance period.
For the 2006 and subsequent awards, the growth target required the increase to be more than 10% per annum above the UK Retail Price Index RPI in the three-year performance period to allow full vesting: if the increase is less than 4% per annum above the UK RPI then there will be no vesting.
A sliding scale operates between 4% and 10% above the UK RPI.
Awards made to other participants are subject solely to the EPS condition.
As a general rule, awards made to participants who leave employment prior to vesting will be forfeited.
In the event a participant leaves as a result of a qualifying reason they receive a pro-rated entitlement.
Subject to vesting, participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared following award, without interest.
Atkins Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP September 2003 to August 2006 A share plan for senior executives and key employees used to make awards to employees that are settled in equity or, in limited circumstances, in cash.
The performance condition was TSR with an EPS growth underpin measured over three financial years starting with the financial year beginning immediately after the award was granted.
Full vesting of any award took place for a TSR performance where the Company ranked in the top 20% in a group of up to 16 comparator companies, 30% vesting for median ranking and no award if TSR fell below the median.
The EPS underpin was the UK RPI plus 2% per annum.
As a general rule, awards made to participants who left employment prior to vesting were forfeited.
In the event that a participant left as a result of a qualifying reason they received a pro-rated entitlement.
All awards have now vested.

EPS was required to be more than 12% per annum above the UK RPI in the relevant three-year performance period to enable all of the ordinary shares to be acquired, but if the EPS growth was less than 5% per annum above the UK RPI then none of the ordinary shares could be acquired.
A sliding scale in relation to the number of ordinary shares that could be acquired operated for growth in EPS between 5% and 12% above the UK RPI.
Participants are entitled to receive the benefit of dividends declared, without interest, on the shares subject to the award between vesting and exercise.
