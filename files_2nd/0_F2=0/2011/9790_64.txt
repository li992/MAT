4 Interest on these bonds is payable semi-annually.
5 These notes include an investor put and issuer call option exercisable in December 2012.
Finance leases The minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as shown in the table on the following page.
It is the Groups policy to lease certain of its properties and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term for equipment is six years last year six years and 125 years last year 125 years for property.
Interest rates are fixed at the contract rate.
All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent payments.
The Groups obligations under finance leases are secured by the lessors charges over the leased assets.
23 Financial instruments Treasury policy and financial risk management The Group operates a centralised treasury function to manage the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the Board approved treasury policies and procedures, and their delegated authorities.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Groups operations.
Group treasury also enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate and currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The purpose of these transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and financing.
It remains the Groups policy not to hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes, except where financial constraints necessitate the need to liquidate any outstanding investments.
The treasury function is managed as a cost centre and does not engage in speculative trading.
The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity funding, interest rate, foreign currency and counterparty risks.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised on the following pages: To nd out more visit marksandspencer.
com annualreport2011 Financial statements 98 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued a Liquidity funding risk The risk that the Group could be unable to settle or meet its obligations as they fall due at a reasonable price.
The Groups funding strategy ensures a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Operating subsidiaries are financed by a combination of retained profits, bank borrowings, medium-term notes and committed syndicated bank facilities.
At year end, the Group had a committed syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 1.2bn set to mature on 26 March 2013.
This facility contains only one financial covenant being the ratio of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and rents payable: to interest plus rents payable.
The covenant is measured semi-annually.
The Group also has a number of undrawn uncommitted facilities available to it.
At year end, these amounted to 105m last year 105m, all of which are due to be reviewed within a year.
At the balance sheet date a sterling equivalent of nil last year 220m was drawn under the committed facilities and nil last year nil was drawn under the uncommitted facilities.
In addition to the existing borrowings, the Group has a euro medium-term note programme of 3bn, of which 1.6bn last year 1.6bn was in issuance as at the balance sheet date.
The present value of finance lease liabilities is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Within one year 12.4 13.6 Later than one year and not later than five years 17.3 26.8 Later than five years 48.6 49.4 Total 78.3 89.8 b Counterparty risk Counterparty risk exists where the Group can suffer financial loss through default or non-performance by financial institutions.
Exposures are managed through Group treasury policy which limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
The counterparties are limited to the approved institutions with secure long-term credit ratings A A1 or better assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors respectively, unless approved on an exception basis by a Board director.
Limits are reviewed regularly by senior management.
The credit risk of these financial instruments is estimated as the fair value of the assets resulting from the contracts.

3 Exposure to a counterparty approved as an exception to treasury policy.
4 Standard & Poors equivalent rating shown as reference to the lowest credit rating of the counterparty from either Standard & Poors or Moodys.
The Group has very low retail credit risk due to transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date was as follows: trade receivables 98m last year 89m, other receivables 61m last year 62m, cash and cash equivalents 470m last year 406m and derivatives 40m last year 181m.
c Foreign currency risk Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of goods from the UK to overseas subsidiaries, and from the import of materials and goods directly sourced from overseas suppliers.
Group treasury hedges these exposures principally using forward foreign exchange contracts progressively covering up to 100% out to 18 months.
Where appropriate hedge cover can be taken out longer than 18 months, with Board approval.
The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange risk in relation to sterling against movements in US dollar and euro.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the Groups forecast currency requirements are designated as cash flow hedges with fair value movements recognised directly in comprehensive income.
To the extent that these hedges cover actual currency payables or receivables, then associated fair value movements previously recognised in comprehensive income are recorded in the income statement in conjunction with the corresponding asset or liability.
As at the balance sheet date the gross notional value in sterling terms of forward foreign exchange sell or buy contracts amounted to 1,062m last year 865m with a weighted average maturity date of six months last year five months.
Gains and losses in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as at 2 April 2011 will be released to the income statement at various dates over the following 14 months last year 13 months from the balance sheet date.
The Group uses a combination of foreign currency debt and derivatives to hedge balance sheet translation exposures.
As at the balance sheet date, 201m and HK$192m of derivatives and nil last year 231m and HK$nil last year HK$180m of currency debt were hedging overseas net assets.
The Group also hedges foreign currency intercompany loans where these exist.
Forward foreign exchange contracts in relation to the hedging of the Groups foreign currency intercompany loans are designated as held for trading with fair value movements being recognised in the income statement.
The corresponding fair value movement of the intercompany loan balance results in an overall nil impact on the income statement.
As at the balance sheet date, the gross notional value of intercompany loan hedges was 175m last year 155m.
After taking into account the hedging derivatives entered into by the Group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups financial liabilities is as set out below excluding short-term payables, the liability to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme and the Marks and Spencer Czech Republic a. s. put option: 2011 2010 Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total m m m m m m Currency Sterling 2,030.1 411.8 2,441.9 2,064.5 410.0 2,474.5 Euro 7.1 33.7 40.8 8.6 232.8 241.4 Hong Kong dollar 15.2 15.2 Other 43.7 43.7 3.3 26.5 29.8 2,037.2 489.2 2,526.4 2,076.4 684.5 2,760.9 To nd out more visit marksandspencer.
com annualreport2011 Financial statements 100 Notes to the financial statements continued 23 Financial instruments continued The floating rate sterling and euro borrowings are linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
These rates are for periods between one and three months.
As at the balance sheet date and excluding finance leases, the fixed rate sterling borrowings are at an average rate of 5.9% last year 5.9% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed is nine years last year ten years.
d Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in relation to the sterling, US dollar, euro and Hong Kong dollar variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The Groups policy is to use derivative contracts where necessary to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings to manage this risk.
The structure and maturity of these derivatives correspond to the underlying borrowings and are accounted for as fair value or cash flow hedges as appropriate.
At the balance sheet date fixed rate borrowings amounted to 2,037.2m last year 2,076.4m representing the public bond issues and finance leases, amounting to 81% last year 76% of the Groups gross borrowings.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet date were as follows: 2011 2010 % % Committed and uncommitted borrowings 0.6 Medium-term notes 5.9 5.9 Finance leases 4.6 4.7 Derivative financial instruments 2011 2010 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Current Options held for trading 14.4 14.4 14.3 14.3 Commodity swap cash flow hedge 2.1 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 2.8 29.9 30.1 5.0 held for trading 1.2 2.4 3.7 1.4 net investment hedges 2.7 Interest rate swaps held for trading 1.3 4.3 18.4 50.7 48.1 27.1 Non-current Cross currency swaps cash flow hedges 37.5 132.8 Forward foreign exchange contracts cash flow hedges 0.7 0.1 Interest rate swaps fair value hedge 0.8 Embedded derivative see note 5 20.3 21.8 37.5 132.9 During the year the cross currency swaps held to redesignate the Groups fixed rate US dollar debt to fixed rate sterling debt were reset to market values, transferring the asset value of the swaps to the Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme as part of the funding plan.
The attributes of the new derivatives match the characteristics of the underlying debt hedged with rates of 6.2197% 2017 bond and 6.88% 2037 bond.
The amounts reported as options held for trading in derivative assets and liabilities represent the fair value of the call option with the puttable callable reset notes, mirrored by the fair value of the sold option to have this call assigned.
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps to redesignate sterling fixed debt to floating debt.
These swaps are accounted for as fair value hedges.
The ineffective portion recognised in the profit or loss that arises from fair value hedges amounts to nil last year 0.4m loss as the loss on the hedged item was 0.9m last year 1.5m gain and the gain on the hedging instrument was 0.9m last year 1.9m loss.
There was no ineffectiveness on cash flow hedging or net investment hedging.
Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2011 Financial statements Strategy Performance & Marketplace Operating review Financial review Governance & other information 101 23 Financial instruments continued Sensitivity analysis The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the income statement and equity as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all of the Groups financial instruments.
The Group considers that a 2% movement in interest rates and a 20% weakening or strengthening in sterling represent reasonable possible changes.
However, this analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The impact in the income statement due to changes in interest rates reflects the effect on the Groups floating rate debt as at the balance sheet date.
The impact in equity reflects the fair value movement in relation to the Groups cross currency swaps.
The impact in the income statement from foreign exchange movements reflects the change in the fair value of the Groups transactional foreign exchange cash flow hedges and the net investment hedges at the balance sheet date.
The equity impact shown for foreign exchange sensitivity relates to derivative and non-derivative financial instruments hedging net investments.
This value is expected to be fully offset by the retranslation of the hedged foreign currency net assets leaving a net equity impact of zero.
The table excludes financial instruments that expose the Group to interest rate and foreign exchange risk where such risk is fully hedged with another financial instrument.
Also excluded are trade receivables and payables as these are either sterling denominated or the foreign exchange risk is hedged.

Unlisted equity investments are included in Level 3.
The fair value of embedded derivatives is determined using the present value of the estimated future cash flows based on financial forecasts.
The nature of the valuation techniques and the judgement around the inputs mean that a change in assumptions could result in significant change in the fair value of the instrument.
As at the end of the reporting period, the Group held the following financial instruments measured at fair value: 2011 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total m m m m m m m m Assets measured at fair value Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Trading derivatives 15.6 15.6 18.0 18.0 Derivatives used for hedging 4.3 4.3 163.0 163.0 Embedded derivatives note 5 20.3 20.3 Available-for-sale financial assets equity securities 3.0 3.0 3.0 3.0 Liabilities measured at fair value Financial liabilities at fair value through profit and loss Trading derivatives 18.1 18.1 19.6 19.6 Derivative used for hedging 70.1 70.1 7.5 7.5 Put option over non-controlling interest 14.6 14.6 63.5 63.5 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 fair value measurements, and no transfers into and out of Level 3 fair value measurements in the current or prior years.
