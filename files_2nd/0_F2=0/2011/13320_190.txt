Retirement benefit obligations Apart from the legally required social security state schemes, the group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The principal scheme in the group is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme RIPS in the UK, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants other than the Initial No 2 Section, accounting for 0.5% of the total schemes liabilities, which remains open.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are usually carried out every three years.
The group has come to an agreement with the UK pension scheme trustees in relation to the 31 March 2010 triennial valuation of the groups UK pension scheme and the funding thereof.
As shown below, the balance sheet records an IAS 19 pension scheme surplus at 31 December 2011 of 144 million, whereas the agreement with the trustees assumes a funding deficit, reflecting the position at 31 March 2010 and the underlying assumptions used for a funding basis.
The funding deficit assumed in the agreement is 80 million with a funding arrangement by the group of 12.5 million per annum over an 8-year period commencing on 1 January 2012.
These defined benefit schemes are reappraised bi-annually by independent actuaries based upon actuarial assumptions in accordance with IAS 19 requirements.
The principal assumptions used for the UK RIPS scheme are shown below.
2011 2010 Weighted average % Discount rate 4.8% 5.4% Expected return on plan assets 5.2% 5.7% Future salary increases 4.0% 4.4% Future pension increases 3.2% 3.5% RPI inflation 3.3% 3.7% CPI inflation 2.4% 3.0% The expected return on plan assets in the above table is a long-term rate of return.
Assets with higher historic volatility are assumed to generate higher returns consistent with widely accepted capital market principles.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average of the expected return for each asset class over the benchmark asset allocation for the scheme at 31 December 2011, less an appropriate allowance for the cost of maintaining the swap portfolio.
Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on 90% of the SAPS Heavy tables for staff members: and 100% of the SAPS Light tables for management members.
In both instances the post-retirement mortality used allows for future mortality improvements in line with CMI 2009 Core Projections.
The long-term minimum rate of future improvement is 1.0% per annum and is a best-estimate rate of future improvements for both staff and management members of the Scheme.
This equates to a man currently aged 65 living for a further 20.5 years if he is a staff member and for a further 23.6 years if he is a management member.
The corresponding figures for a woman are 23.8 and 24.6 years respectively.
The same assumptions were adopted at 31 December 2010.
