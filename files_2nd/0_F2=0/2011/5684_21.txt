The parent company, DMGT, is required to account for the Harmsworth Pension Scheme under IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The IAS 19 disclosures in the Annual Report and Accounts of DMGT have been based on calculations performed as part of the work being carried out for the formal valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2010, and adjusted to October 2 2011 to take account of membership data as at September 30 2011.
The calculations are adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by IAS 19.
These showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1,333.6 million 2010: 1,342.6 million and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 83.0% 2010: 86.2% of the benefits that had accrued to members also calculated in accordance with IAS 19.
The valuations and disclosures required under IAS 19 for the financial statements of DMGT are not materially different to the valuations and disclosures required under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Harmsworth Pension Scheme.
The scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers i. e. the contribution rate charged to each employer is affected by the experience of the schemes as a whole.
The scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
On September 30 2010, the group sold the companys trade and trading assets and liabilities to Euromoney Trading Limited, an indirectly owned group company.

As part of the restructuring, the company acquired a 56% stake in Euromoney Canada Limited ECL formerly Euromoney Telcap 1 Limited and 100% stake in Euromoney Canada Finance Limited formerly Euromoney Telcap 2 Limited from its subsidiary Euromoney Institutional Investor Ventures Limited EIIV.
Following the acquisition, the company sold 100% of its shareholding in EIIV to ECL.
As part of a project to reduce the number of legal entities within the group Euromoney Yen Finance Limited EYF, a 100% owned subsidiary, was struck off the register at Companies House during the year.
Accordingly the companys investment in EYF, previously impaired to nil net book value, was written off.

At the same time an impairment review was completed and the companys investments in these entities were written down.
