Risk Management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the Group invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to achieve its investment objective as stated on page 19.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Group is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Groups net assets or a reduction in the revenue available for distribution by way of dividends.
These financial risks, market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and market price risk, liquidity and credit risk, and the Directors approach to the management of them, are set out below.
The Investment Manager, in close co-operation with the Board of Directors, coordinates the Groups risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks are set out below and have not changed from the previous accounting period.
i Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Group may fluctuate due to changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises currency risk see note 18 ii, interest rate risk see note 18 iii and market price risk see note 18 iv.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks.
The Investment Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
ii Currency risk A proportion of the Groups assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Groups functional currency, and in which it reports its results.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
At 31 December 2011, the value of non-sterling denominated investments amounted to 937,605,000 2010: 1,236,586,000.
Management of the risk The Investment Manager monitors the Groups exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board on a regular basis.
Foreign currency borrowing and forward currency contracts are used to limit the Groups exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currency is converted into sterling on receipt.
The Group does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items which have foreign currency exposure at 31 December 2011 are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are denominated in a foreign currency, the principals have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall exposure.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the profit after tax for the year and the equity in regard to the Groups monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for sterling US dollar, sterling Canadian dollar, sterling Australian dollar and sterling Peru nuevo sol.
It assumes the following changes in exchange rates: Sterling US dollar -5% 2010: 5% Sterling Canadian dollar -5% 2010: 5% Sterling Australian dollar -5% 2010: 5% Sterling Peru nuevo sol -10% 2010: 5% These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous 12 months.
