COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Capital commitments The Group has capital commitments outstanding against major contracts.
As at 31 December 2011 2010 Nature of contract: $000 $000 road construction 320 3,122 Well construction 19,090 39,823 oil reserves development work 5,341 7,653 pipeline construction 18 1,510 other 118 291 Total 24,887 52,399 Leases the group leases wells and associated land plots from government agencies in the russian Federation.
The initial terms on all leases has expired as at 31 December 2011.
The lease terms allow for continued lease renewal after expiry of the initial term.
At the present time the annual payments arising on the leases are approximately $351 thousand.
In continuing to use these wells, the Group relies on Article 621 2 of the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, which states that such leases are renewed for an indefinite term if the tenant continues to use the property after the term of the lease has expired in the absence of objections from the lessor, although either party is entitled to terminate the lease upon three months notice.
The group believes that the russian authorities are unlikely to exercise this termination right as the group has the exclusive right to extract the oil resources underlying the wells and continues to make lease payments.
Management expects to continue to pay for the leases until the end of the life of the reserves, in approximately a range between 2027 and 2038.
66 Exillon Energy Notes to audited 2011 IFRS financial statements The Group also leases apartments for offices at Exillon WS and Exillon TP.
At the present time the annual payments arising on the leases are approximately $294 thousand.
Minimum lease payments were as follows: As at 31 December 2011 2010 $000 $000 Within one year 644 470 Two to five years 1,402 986 Later than five years 3,856 2,959 Total 5,902 4,415 Taxes Russian tax legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently.
Managements interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the groups subsidiaries may be challenged by the relevant federal authorities.
recent events within the russian Federation suggest that the tax authorities may be taking a more assertive position in their interpretation of the legislation and assessments in different areas, including general tax deductibility and tax depreciation rules, transfer pricing regulations, application of thin capitalisation rules, etc.
As a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed.
Fiscal periods remain open to review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review.
Under certain circumstances reviews may cover longer periods.
combined with a possible increase in tax collection efforts to respond to budget pressures, the above may lead to an increase in the level and frequency of scrutiny by the tax authorities.
in particular, it is possible that transactions and activities that have not been challenged in the past may be challenged.
Russian transfer pricing legislation introduced on 1 January 1999 provided the possibility for tax authorities to make transfer pricing adjustments and impose additional tax liabilities in respect of all controllable transactions where the transaction price differs from the market price by more than 20%.
controllable transactions included: transactions with interdependent parties as determined under the Russian Tax Code, all cross-border transactions irrespective of whether performed between related or unrelated parties, transactions where the price applied by a taxpayer differs by more than 20% from the price applied in similar transactions by the same taxpayer within a short period of time, and barter transactions.
There was no formal guidance as to how these rules should be applied in practice.
in the past, the arbitration court has governed practice in this area.
in compliance with the new transfer pricing rules, which have been enacted in the russian Federation from 2012, controllable transactions include export sales exceeding 60 million roubles approximately $2 million per calendar year and domestic transactions between related parties exceeding 3 billion Roubles approximately $105 million.
The rule of 20% difference between transaction price and market price was abolished.
Moreover, the new methods for determining arms length prices were introduced with elaboration of previous pricing methods to harmonise them with oEcD transfer pricing principles.
The requirement for formal reporting of controllable transactions and preparation of documentation supporting arms length prices was incorporated.
currently the impact of these changes cannot be reliably estimated.
The group includes companies incorporated outside of the russian Federation.
Tax liabilities of the Group are determined on the assumption that these companies are not subject to Russian profits tax because they do not have a permanent establishment in russia.
russian tax laws do not provide detailed rules on taxation of foreign companies.
it is possible that with the evolution of the interpretation of these rules and the changes in the approach of the russian tax authorities, the non-taxable status of some or all of the foreign companies of the group in russia may be challenged.
The impact of any such challenge cannot be reliably estimated: however, it may be significant to the financial position and or the overall operations of the entity.
