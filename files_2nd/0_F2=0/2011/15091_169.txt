Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital employed.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital employed is calculated as equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt.
The Group is in a net cash position at 1 May 2011.
The Directors have concluded that the Company is best served by retaining current cash reserves to support growth.
Consequentially, a recommendation will be made to the AGM that no dividend is payable for 2011 2010: nil.
