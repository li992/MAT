2007 CEO Special Award Special Award Grant details Approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting, the Special Award is a one-off conditional share award granted to the Chief Executive equal to 700% of his 2007 08 base salary.
The Special Award was subject to a three-year performance period ending on 31 March 2010 followed by a holding period and detailed below.
Vesting requirements Performance requirements: The performance measures applying to the Special Award reflected those applying to the 2007 LTIP with some elements being more demanding.
The Special Award was split into two layers, each of which vested on a different basis.
For the first layer equal to 200% of base salary, 20% would vest for threshold performance and 100% for maximum performance.
For the second layer equal to 500% of base salary, there would be no vesting for threshold performance, but 100% would vest for maximum performance.
Vesting in each layer was to be on a straight-line basis between these points.
For each layer of the Special Award 50% would vest based on TSR and 50% based on EPS growth, as for the 2007 LTIP.
However, for the TSR part of the Special Award, maximum vesting would require more stretching performance equivalent toupper quintile.
This was calculated by the advisers to the Remuneration Committee as outperformance of the mean of the Standard & Poors Global 1200 Capital Goods Index constituents by a factor of 1.4 i. e. 40%.
In addition, the Remuneration Committee retained discretion to ensure that as a condition for the vesting of shares, the underlying overall performance of theCompany had been satisfactory.
In the case of the TSR performance target, factors thatwould be taken into account will include EPS growth and the Companys cash position.
Result of Performance Requirements for CEO Special Award With regard to the TSR test, the Remuneration Committee determined that 93.0% of the first layer of shares and 91.3% ofthesecond layer of shares were available to vest.
Of this total, 50% were released as soon as practicablefollowing the announcement of the full-year results for 2009 10 and the balance will be released as soon as practicable following a 12-monthperiod from the first release at 25 May 2010.
With regard to the EPS part of the award 50%, after considering the 2009 10 audited financial results, the Remuneration Committee determined that the threshold level of EPS CAGR required for vesting was not achieved and the shares subject totheEPS performance condition, as a result, lapsed.
Service requirements: The general rule is that the award would be forfeited if the participant left employment, although shares may be released in defined good leaver cases or with the consent of the Remuneration Committee.
The holder left the Company on 24 March 2011 and the Remuneration Committee permitted retention of the entitlement to the remaining 50% of the shares under the SpecialAward.
