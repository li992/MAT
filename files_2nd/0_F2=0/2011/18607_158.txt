This was equivalent to 0.53p per share.

16 Earnings loss per share Basic Basic earnings loss per share is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to the owners of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the group and held both in trust and as treasury shares to meet its obligations under the long-term incentive scheme LTIS and deferred bonus plan DBP.
Diluted Diluted earnings loss per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares in issue by the dilutive effect of ordinary shares that the company may potentially issue relating to its convertible bond and its share option schemes and contingent share awards under the LTIS and DBP, based upon the number of shares that would be issued if 30 September 2011 was the end of the contingency period.
The profit loss for the year is adjusted to add back the after tax interest cost on the debt component of the convertible bond.
Where the effect of the above adjustments is antidilutive, they are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings loss per share.
