# !$ !$ THE MINERAL RESOURCES ARE REPORTED AS ADDITIONAL TO ORE RESERVES.
Mining method: OP Open Pit.
Mine Life the extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Catalo Oxide Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to production.
2 Catalo Oxide Mineral Resources: The Oxide Resources are reported above a 0.5% Nb O cut-off.
The Mineral Resources are split into Oxide and Fresh Rock due to the recognition of distinct 2 5 differences in mineralogical characteristics.
3 Catalo Fresh Rock Mineral Resources: The Fresh Rock Resources are reported above a 0.7% Nb O cut-off.
A drilling campaign is being undertaken, the geological model and geotechnical 2 5 study will be updated once this is completed.
It is anticipated that Ore Reserves will be declared in 2012.
