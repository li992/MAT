Changes in fair value of any derivative financial instruments are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, capital risk and credit risk.
There is no material currency exposure as all material transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The Group has no material exposure to equity securities or commodity price risk and it is the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised on pages 25 to 27.
Interest rate risk As the Group has no significant interest-bearing assets, other than cash and cash equivalents, the Groups income and operating cash flows are substantially independent of changes in market interest rates.
Income and cash flows from cash and cash equivalents fluctuate with interest rates.
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds and loan notes.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practicable, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
At 20 August 2011, the Group held 49.5m of floating rate notes for which interest swaps remain outstanding August 2010: 24.0m, August 2009: nil.
The Group has taken out derivative financial instruments such that 100% of all loans at 20 August 2011 August 2010: 100%, August 2009: 100% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements, thereby largely eliminating the Groups exposure to changes in interest rates.
