Man Group plc 69 Annual Report 2011 Other investments in fund products are not actively traded and the valuation at the fund level cannot be determined by reference to other available prices.
The fair values of investments in fund products are derived from the reported NAVs of each of the fund products, which in turn are based upon the value of the underlying assets held within each of the fund products and the timings of being able to redeem the fund product.
The valuation of the underlying assets within each fund product is determined by external valuation service providers VSP based on an agreed valuation policy and methodology.
Whilst these valuations are performed independently of Man, Man has established oversight procedures and due diligence processes to ensure that the net asset values reported by the VSP are reliable and appropriate.
Man makes adjustments to NAVs where the timing of being able to redeem the fund product or events or circumstances indicate that the NAVs are not reflective of fair value.
Fair value heirarchy of financial assets is disclosed in AFI Note 11.
Fee and other receivables $m 2011 2010 Fee receivables 112 52 Prepayments and accrued income 164 119 Other receivables 246 149 522 320 Fee and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any provision for impairment.
Fee receivables and accrued income represent management and performance fees from fund products and are received in cash when the funds NAV is determined.
All fees are deducted from the NAV of the respective funds by the independent administrators and therefore the credit risk of fee receivables is minimal.
No balances were overdue or delinquent at year end.
Other receivables includes the BlueCrest new loan notes, issued in March 2011, with a par value of $100 million, as part of the consideration received upon disposal of our equity stake Note 18.
The new loan notes, which carry a 6.5% cash coupon, are repayable in 2016, although BlueCrest has the right to repay the new loan notes before this date.
In certain circumstances, the maturity of the new loan notes can be extended by BlueCrest, in which case the coupon may increase, but the final maturity will not be later than April 2019.
Man expects that the new loan notes will be held to maturity and fully repaid.
The balance at 31 March 2010 included the existing loan notes which were redeemed at their par value of $37 million.
