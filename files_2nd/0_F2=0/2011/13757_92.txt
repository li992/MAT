Goodwill continued Assumptions The recoverable amount for a CGU is determined based on value in use calculations.
Value in use is determined by discounting the future post-tax cash flows generated from continuing use of the CGU using a post-tax discount rate, as this closely approximates to applying pre-tax discount rates to pre-tax cash flows.
Where a potential impairment is identified using post-tax cash flows and post-tax discount rates, the impairment review is re-performed on a pre-tax basis in order to determine the impairment loss to be recorded.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are as follows: Expected volume growth rate Cash flows are based on financial forecasts approved by management covering five-year periods and are dependent on the expected volume growth rates.
Discount rate The discount rate weighted average cost of capital is calculated using a methodology which reflects the returns from United States Treasury notes with a maturity of 20 years, and an equity risk premium adjusted for specific industry and country risks.
The group applies local post-tax discount rates to local post-tax cash flows.
Long-term growth rate Cash flows after the first five-year period were extrapolated using a long-term growth rate, in order to calculate the terminal recoverable amount.
The following table presents the key assumptions used in the value in use calculations in each of the groups operating segments: Expected volume growth rates Post-tax Long-term 2012-2016 discount rates growth rates Latin America 3.3%5.8% 8.2%11.1% 2.0%3.0% Europe 1.2%12.8% 7.9%9.7% 2.0%2.5% North America 6.2% 7.4% 2.5% Africa 1.7%12.8% 8.2%18.9% 3.0%7.5% Asia 6.3%21.4% 8.4%10.2% 3.0%7.0% South Africa 2.6% 8.7% 3.0% Impairment reviews results As a result of the annual impairment reviews, no impairment losses have been recognised in the year 2010: US$nil.
Sensitivities to assumptions The groups impairment reviews are sensitive to changes in the key assumptions described above.
Based on the groups sensitivity analysis, areasonably possible change in a single assumption will not cause an impairment loss in any of the groups CGUs.
