2011 overview Consolidated fi financial statements and notes Notes to the company financial statements Business review Company fi financial statements and notes for the year ended 30 April 2011 Management and governance Additional information I Summary of signi cant accounting policies The basis of preparation and the principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial information are set out below.
A Basis of preparation The Company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modi ed by the share options at fair value through the pro t and loss account and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and all applicable UK accounting standards.
B Foreign currency translation The functional currency of the Company is US Dollars.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the pro t and loss account.
C Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
D Called up share capital, share premium and dividend distribution Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
E Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable pro ts at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be a suitable taxable pro t from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
F Employee bene t costs a Pension obligations The Company operates a fide ned contribution plan for which it pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The Company has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee bene t expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Share based compensation The Company operated various equity-settled, share based compensation plans during the year.
No expense is recognised in respect of share options granted before 7 November 2002 and vested before 1 January 2005.
For shares or share options granted after 7 November 2002 and vested after 1 January 2005 the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the shares or options is recognised as an expense.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares or options granted.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the pro t and loss account, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
The shares are recognised when the options are exercised and the proceeds received allocated between called up share capital and share premium account.
G Financial instruments The accounting policy of the Company for financial instruments is the same as that shown in the Group accounting policies.
This policy is in accordance with FRS 26, Financial Instruments Recognition & Measurement.

Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The number of options received is determined by the performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to the 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period or a combination of cumulative EPS growth and ASR.
For the latter, where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum at which 25% of awards will vest and full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 9% per annum.
The resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report.
