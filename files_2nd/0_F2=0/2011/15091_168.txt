16.33 Financial risk management The Company and Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk including foreign currency risk, fixed interest rate risk and cash flow interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For Wholesale customers, management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other factors.
For those sales considered higher risk, the Group operates a policy of cash in advance of sale.
Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash or by major credit cards.
The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure.
Credit risk from cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well established banks with a strong credit rating.
Foreign currency risk The Groups foreign currency exposure arises from: l transactions sales purchases denominated in foreign currencies: l monetary items mainly cash and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies: and l foreign currency net assets of overseas operations.
The Group is mainly exposed to US Dollar and Euro currency risks.
The exposure to foreign exchange risk within each Company is monitored and managed at a Group level.
The Groups policy is to hedge a portion of foreign exchange risk associated with forecast overseas transactions, and transactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies.
The Groups policy is to hedge the risk of changes in the relevant spot exchange rate.
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange risk.
As at 1 May 2011 and 2 May 2010, the Group had entered into a number of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge part of the aforementioned translation risk.
Any remaining amount remains unhedged.
Forward exchange contracts have not been formally designated as hedges and consequently no hedge accounting has been applied.
Forward exchange contracts are valued at fair value.
At 1 May 2011 if the currency had weakened strengthened by 10% against both the US Dollar and Euro with all other variables held constant, profit for the period would have been 0.7m 2010: 0.1m higher lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US Dollar Euro trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade payables.
In the prior year the Group entered into a currency agreement with a supplier to guarantee the supplier a minimum exchange rate on the Group purchases.
This derivative was valued at fair value through the Group statement of comprehensive income.

Cash flow interest rate risk The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily on deposits, loans and borrowings by changing their future cash flows variable rate.
Management does not currently have a formal policy of determining how much of the Groups exposure should be at fixed or variable rates and the Group does not use hedging instruments to minimise its exposure.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to determine whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable for the Group over the expected period until maturity.
Sensitivity analysis has not been provided due to the low level of loans and borrowings within the Group.
The Groups significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 16.26 to 16.28.
Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed on a Group basis by the monitoring of rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
