Under the Schemes of Arrangement, Allied Gold Limiteds shares and options on issue as at June 30, 2011 were exchanged on a six for one basis to Allied Gold Mining PLC shares and options.
All disclosures of shares and options in the report reflect this change as though the six for one exchange had always been in place.
2 On April 6, 2011 Allied Gold Limited completed placement of 156.3 million new ordinary shares to institutional and sophisticated investors at AUD$0.60 GBP38.5p each.
As part of the six for one exchange to Allied Gold Mining PLC shares this issue was converted to 26,053,922 shares.
3 The share capital balance reflects that Allied Gold Limited, an Australian Company, was the parent entity of the Group until June 30, 2011 and as a consequence the Group did not have a share premium account.

Subsequent share issues have been recognised at par value in the share capital account with the balance shown as share premium.

c Capital management The primary objective of managing the Groups capital is to ensure that there is sufficient capital available, in the form of debt or equity funding, to support the funding requirements of the Group, including capital expenditure, in a way that optimises the cost of capital, maximises shareholders' returns and ensures that the Group remains in a sound financial position.
There were no changes to the Group's overall capital management approach during the current year.
The Group manages and makes adjustments to the capital structure as opportunities arise in the market place, as and when borrowings mature or as and when funding is required.
This may take the form of raising equity, market or bank debt or hybrids thereof.
