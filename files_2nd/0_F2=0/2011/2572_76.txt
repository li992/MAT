This price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price for five year plans and 10% for three year plans.
The options must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract, otherwise they lapse.
Similar plans operate for BTs overseas employees.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP, for employees in the United States, enables participants to purchase American Depositary Shares ADSs quarterly at a price which is 85% of the fair market price of an ADS at the end of each quarterly purchase period.
Share plans Incentive Share Plan, Deferred Bonus Plan and Retention Share Plan Under the BT Group Incentive Share Plan ISP, participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measures and if the participants are still employed by the group.
In 2010 the corporate performance measures for the ISP was amended.
For all ISP awards made, 50% of each share award is linked to a total shareholder return target TSR for a comparator group of companies from the beginning of the relevant performance period and the remaining 50% is linked to a three-year cumulative free cash ow measure.
The comparator group contains European telecommunications companies and companies which are either similar in size or market capitalisation and or have a similar business mix and spread to BT.
For ISP awards prior to 2010, a single corporate performance measure was used, being BTs TSR measured against a comparator group of companies from the European telecommunications sector.
Under the BT Group Deferred Bonus Plan DBP awards are granted annually to selected employees of the group.
Shares in the company are transferred to participants at the end of three years if they continue to be employed by the group throughout that period.
Under the BT Group Retention Share Plan RSP, the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest annually in tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the employee is still employed by the group.
In accordance with the terms of the ISP, DBP and RSP, dividends or dividend equivalents earned on shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
