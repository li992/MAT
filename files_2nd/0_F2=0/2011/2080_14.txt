BHP BILLITON SUMMARY REVIEW 2011 | 1 Our results at a glance Record financial results, including Underlying EBITDA up 51 per cent to US$37.1 billion, Underlying EBIT up 62 per cent to US$32.0 billion and attributable profit excluding exceptional items up 74 per cent to US$21.7 billion.
Strong margins and returns illustrated by increase in Underlying EBIT margin to 47 per cent and Underlying return on capital to 39 per cent.
Record production across four commodities and 10 operations.
Record operating cash flow of US$30.1 billion and gearing of nine per cent confirms capacity to comfortably fund the Groups US$15.1 billion acquisition of Petrohawk Energy Corporation and extensive organic growth program.
Completion of expanded US$10 billion capital management program highlights commitment to maintain an appropriate capital structure through all points of the economic cycle.
Twenty-two per cent rebasing of final dividend for full year dividend payout of 101 US cents per share.
Two fatalities occurred at controlled operations.
The FY2011 total recordable injury frequency TRIF performance was 5.0 per million hours worked, a six per cent improvement on 5.3 per million hours worked in FY2010.
Underlying EBITDA is Underlying EBIT before depreciation, impairments and amortisation.
We believe that Underlying EBIT and Underlying EBITDA provide useful information, but should not be considered as an indication of, or alternative to, attributable profit as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity.
b Net operating cash flow is after net interest and taxation.
c Following a change in financial reporting requirements, expenditures which do not result in a recognised asset are now classified as cash flows from operating activities.
This has resulted in exploration cash flows which are not recognised as assets being reclassified from net investing cash flows to net operating cash flows for all comparative figures.
d Gearing is net debt over net debt plus net assets.
The measure is inclusive of continuing operations of Group companies and jointly controlled entities.

BHP BILLITON SUMMARY REVIEW 2011 | 31 Accountability Delegation Corporate Governance Summary Governance at BHP Billiton We are committed to the highest level of governance and strive to foster a culture that values and rewards exemplary ethical standards, personal and corporate integrity and respect for others.
The Board governs the Group consistent with our long stated business strategy and commitment to a transparent and high-quality governance system.
Our approach to governance is predicated on the belief that there is a link between high-quality governance and the creation of long-term shareholder value.
It is our view that governance is not just a matter for the Board: a good governance culture must be fostered throughout the organisation.
Corporate governance principles continue to be refined by regulators, including new guidance on Board effectiveness from the UK Financial Reporting Council, additional legislative measures in Australia in relation to executive remuneration and the use of remuneration consultants, the implementation of the Stewardship Code for investors in the UK and a continued focus on diversity of skills, experience, nationality and gender on Boards.
BHP Billiton adopted early the Australian Securities Exchange Corporate Governance Council Principles and Recommendations on diversity in 2010, and this year the Board has spent time considering its aspirational diversity goals.
The Board believes that critical mass is important for diversity and, in relation to gender, has set an aspirational goal of increasing the number of women on the Board to at least three over the next two years which, if achieved, would see the proportion of women on the Board increase from 17 per cent currently to 25 per cent, based on a Board size of 12.
This is consistent with Lord Davies report in the UK, which recommends that FTSE 350 companies should set aspirational goals for Board gender composition.

The Report contains the remuneration disclosures required by Australian and UK regulations.
In addition, we have again reported the actual remuneration paid to our Executive team during the year.
Over FY2011, the Committee has continued to apply the remuneration framework that has been in place since 2004.
This has served us well, requiring minimal alteration during a period of considerable change.
There are no changes proposed in our approach to remuneration for FY2012.
However, the tenth anniversary of the BHP and Billiton merger in June 2011 provides a fitting backdrop to consider the growth and development of the Group since that date and the opportunities and challenges ahead.
We believe our remuneration strategy should reinforce sustainable, long-term value creation.
To achieve our business goals, our remuneration must remain competitive to attract and retain talented executives, enabling us to realise our opportunities and further develop our business.
Striking the appropriate balance between these considerations is important for the continued long-term success of the Group.
To ensure that our remuneration policy continues to reinforce the Groups strategies, the Committee has commenced a comprehensive review of our remuneration structures.
We are reviewing the external environment within which we operate and how that environment may evolve.
We will also consider the global market status, the risk environment and strategic priorities for BHP Billiton.
Over the course of FY2012, we will progress this review, developing appropriate remuneration proposals that will support our focus on operational excellence, risk management and the execution of the Groups strategy.
We consider effective governance and clear reporting on remuneration essential to maintaining the strong level of support that shareholders have demonstrated for the Remuneration Report.
As in prior years, the FY2011 Report is designed to be clear and concise, to meet regulatory requirements, and, above all, provide you with the information required to consider the alignment of remuneration and the Groups success.
