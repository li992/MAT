Income tax continued The tax for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 28% 2010: 28%.

In addition, a protective tax payment of 60.7m was paid in relation to an outstanding issue with HM Revenue & Customs for periods prior to REIT conversion.
The Group holds a further provision of 25.8m for interest on overdue tax in relation to this matter, which may become payable if the matter is not settled in our favour.
The provision will be released, and the tax paid recovered, if the Groups claims are successful.
In the prior year the Group reached agreement in relation to a number of issues, resulting in payment of additional tax of 14.0m and a release of provisions to the income statement of 21.0m.
Land Securities Group PLC elected for group Real Estate Investment Trust REIT status with effect from 1 January 2007.
As a result, the Group no longer pays UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group continue to be subject to corporation tax as normal.

The impairment of trading properties has been removed from our adjusted earnings due to the long-term nature of these programmes.
The adjustment to net liabilities on joint ventures is the result of valuation deficits in previous years, partially reversed by surpluses in the current year.
The calculation of EPRA adjusted earnings does not adjust for these items but it does adjust for any profits losses on the disposal of trading properties.
