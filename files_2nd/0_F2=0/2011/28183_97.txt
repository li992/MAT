82 Financial Statements notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued For the year ended 30 April 2011 31 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Risk management policies and procedures The Group comprises of an investment trust and a wholly owned subsidiary.
The Group invests in equities and other financial instruments for the long term to further the investment objective set out on page 33.
This exposes the Group to a range of financial risks that could impact on the assets or performance of the Group.
The main risks arising from the Groups pursuit of its investment objective are market risk, liquidity risk and credit risk and the Directors approach to the management of them is set out below.
The risks have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which the accounts relate.
The Groups exposure to financial instruments comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and fixed interest securities which are held in the investment portfolio in accordance with the Groups investment objective.
Term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations Cash, liquid resources and short-term receivables and payables that arise directly from the Groups operations Derivative transactions which the Group enters into may include equity or index options, index future contracts, and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The purpose of these is to manage the market price risks and foreign exchange risks arising from the Groups investment activities, or to enhance capital returns.
The overall management of the risks is determined by the Board and its approach to each risk identified is set out below.
The Board and the investment manager co-ordinate the risk management and the investment manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision.
a Market Risk Market risk comprises three types of risk: market price risk see note 31 a i, currency risk see note 31 a ii, and interest rate risk see note 31 a iii.
i Market Price Risk The Company is an investment company and as such its performance is dependent on its valuation of its investments.
Consequently market price risk is the most significant risk that the Group faces.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
A detailed breakdown of the investment portfolio is given on pages 24 to 29.
Investments are valued in accordance with the Groups accounting policies as stated in Note 2 g. At the the year end, the Companys portfolio included two derivative instruments, a Nokia Call option and Yahoo Call Option.
Both options will mature in September 2011 and are tradeable securities.
Management of the risk In order to manage this risk it is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce both the statistical risk and the risk arising from factors specific to a particular technology sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets, together with stock selection covering small, medium and large companies, and the use of index options, are other factors which act to reduce price risk.
The investment manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2011 Financial Statements notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 83 Market price risks exposure The Groups exposure to changes in market prices at 30 April on its quoted and unquoted investments was as follows: Group Company Group Company 30 April 2011 30 April 2011 30 April 2010 30 April 2010 000 000 000 000 Non-current asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 458,094 460,288 386,031 388,207 Current asset investments at fair value through profit or loss 307 307 458,401 460,595 386,031 388,207 An analysis of the Groups portfolio is shown on pages 24 to 29.
Market price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and the value of shareholders funds to an increase or decrease of 15% 30 April 2010:15% in the fair values of the Groups investments.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions and historic trends.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Groups investments at each balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk The investment manager mitigates the individual currency risks through the international spread of investments and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are entered into to manage the asset exposure to those currencies, which vary according to the asset allocation.
Foreign currency exposure The table below shows, by currency, the split of the Groups non-sterling monetary assets, liabilities and investments that are priced in currencies other than sterling.

Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the loss after tax for the year and the value of shareholders funds in regard to the financial assets and financial liabilities and the exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro, Japanese yen, Hong Kong dollar, Korean won and Taiwan dollar.
It is not possible to forecast how much rates might move in the next year but based on historic movements the following changes appear reasonably possible: US dollar - 10% 2010: 10% Euro - 10% 2010: 10% Japanese yen - 15% 2010: 15% Hong Kong dollar - 10% 2010: 10% Korean won - 10% 2010: 10% Taiwan dollar - 15% 2010: 15% If sterling had depreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: Group 30 April 2011 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US dollar Euro Yen dollar won dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 114 25 12 19 17 88 Capital return 40,211 1,973 2,816 1,271 1,936 3,351 Change to the profit after tax for the year 40,325 1,998 2,828 1,290 1,953 3,439 Change to shareholders funds 40,325 1,998 2,828 1,290 1,953 3,439 Group 30 April 2010 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US dollar Euro Yen dollar won dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 141 15 5 6 9 60 Capital return 34,361 1,530 2,365 879 1,484 3,367 Change to the profit after tax for the year 34,502 1,545 2,370 885 1,493 3,427 Change to shareholders funds 34,502 1,545 2,370 885 1,493 3,427 Polar Capital Technology Trust plc Annual Report & Financial Statements for the year ended 30 April 2011 F Fi INAN nAnC CI iAL AL ST STA AT TE eM ME eN nT TS S 86 86 F Fi in na an nc ci ia al l S St ta ate tem me en nt ts s n no ote tes s t to o t the he C Co on ns sol oli id da ate ted d F Fi in na an nc ci ia al l S St ta ate tem me en nt ts s N NO OT TE ES S TO TO T TH HE E C CO ON NS SO OL LI ID DA AT TE ED D F FI IN NA AN NC CI IA AL L S ST TA AT TE EM ME EN NT TS S c con ont ti in nue ued d F Fo or t r th he y e ye ea ar e r en nd fide ed 3 d 30 A 0 Ap pr ri il 2 l 20 01 11 1 31 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued If sterling had appreciated against the currencies shown, this would have the following effect: Group 30 April 2011 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US dollar Euro Yen dollar won dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 93 20 9 15 14 65 Capital return 32,900 1,614 2,082 1,040 1,584 2,477 Change to the profit after tax for the year 32,993 1,634 2,091 1,055 1,598 2,542 Change to shareholders funds 32,993 1,634 2,091 1,055 1,598 2,542 Group 30 April 2010 000 Hong Kong Korean Taiwan US dollar Euro Yen dollar won dollar Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 115 13 4 5 8 44 Capital return 28,114 1,252 1,748 719 1,214 2,489 Change to the profit after tax for the year 28,229 1,265 1,752 724 1,222 2,533 Change to shareholders funds 28,229 1,265 1,752 724 1,222 2,533 The impact on the Company figures have not been given as they would not materially differ from the Group figures.
In the opinion of the Directors, neither of the above sensitivity analyses are representative of the year as a whole since the level of exposure changes frequently as part of the currency risk management process used to meet the Companys objectives.
iii Interest Rate Risk Interest rate changes may effect the income received from cash at bank and interest payable on borrowings.
All cash balances earn interest at a variable rate.
The Group finances its operations through its term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained gains arising from operations.
The Group uses borrowings in the desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest to both generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Management of the risk The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.

The table below illustrates the Groups sensitivity to interest rate movements, with a change of 0.25% p. a. in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial assets and a change of 0.25% p. a in the rates of interest available to the Groups financial liabilities.
The effect on the revenue and capital return after tax and the value of shareholders funds are as follows if rates increased: 30 April 2011 30 April 2010 v Group Company Group Company 000 000 000 000 Statement of Comprehensive Income profit after tax Revenue return 41 27 36 22 Capital return Change to the profit loss after tax for the year 41 27 36 22 Change to shareholders funds 41 27 36 22 A corresponding decrease in the rate would have equal and opposite effect to that shown in the table above.
This level of change is considered to be reasonably possible based on observation of current market conditions.
This is not representative of the year as a whole, since the exposure changes as the level of cash loans held during the year will be affected by the strategy being followed in response to the Investment Managers perception of market prospects and the investment opportunities available at any particular time.
