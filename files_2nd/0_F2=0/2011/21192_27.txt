The results and cash flows of these operations have been translated into sterling at the average rates for the year and the assets and liabilities have been translated at the year-end rates as follows: 2011 2010 Eurozone Average rate 1 equals 0.87 0.85 Period end rate 1 equals 0.84 0.86 United States Average rate US$1 equals 0.63 0.65 Period end rate US$1 equals 0.65 0.64 Total foreign currency movements during 2011 resulted in a loss recognised in the income statement of 35 million 2010: 34 million gain.
2 Presentation changes As described in note 3 b, the Groups shareholding in Delta Lloyd N. V. Delta Lloyd was reduced to 42.7%, representing 40% of shareholder voting rights, following the sale of shares on 6 May 2011.
Our holding has since been diluted to 41.9% at 31 December 2011, representing 39.3% of shareholder voting rights, through Delta Lloyds issue of scrip dividends which we did not take up.
As the Group no longer commands a majority of shareholder voting rights, it no longer controls Delta Lloyd.
Accordingly, from 6 May 2011 the Group has ceased to consolidate the results and net assets of Delta Lloyd.
The effect of this in the various movements reconciliation tables in these notes is described as Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd.
The transaction resulted in the loss of control of a major geographical area of operations, previously presented as Delta Lloyd in the segmental reporting note.
The results of Delta Lloyd up to the transaction date, as well as those for preceding years, have therefore been classified as discontinued operations.
The Groups share of the profits of its retained interest in Delta Lloyd as an associate after the transaction date is reported in a separate segment as part of continuing operations.

The principal Group subsidiaries are listed on pages 50 to 51. a Acquisitions i Material acquisitions There were no material acquisitions in the year ended 31 December 2011. ii Other goodwill arising Goodwill on acquisitions and additions, as shown in note 16 a was 13 million, of which 8 million arose on the acquisition of an insurance broker in Canada and 5 million from additional capital in our Indonesian life and health subsidiary.

i RAC Limited On 30 September 2011, the Group sold RAC Limited RAC to The Carlyle Group for 977 million, realising a profit of 532 million.
Aviva is continuing its commercial relationship with RAC, both as a key underwriter of motor insurance on RACs panel and as a partner, selling RAC breakdown cover to our customers.
The Group has retained the RAC 2003 Pension Scheme which, at 31 December 2011, had an IAS 19 deficit of 51 million.
The profit on disposal is calculated as follows: 2011 m Assets Goodwill 284 Intangible assets 229 Property and equipment 30 Receivables 85 Other assets 43 Total assets 671 Liabilities Insurance liabilities 161 Tax liabilities 57 Other liabilities 73 Total liabilities 291 Net assets disposed of 380 Cash consideration 977 Less: transaction costs and provisions 65 Net consideration 912 Profit on disposal 532 ii Aviva Investors Australia On 1 October 2011, the Group sold its Australian fund management business, Aviva Investors Australia Ltd, to nabInvest, National Australia Banks direct asset management business, for 35 million, which includes contingent consideration with a fair value of 3 million.
Net assets disposed of were 11 million, comprising assets of 15 million and liabilities of 4 million, giving a profit of 20 million after transaction costs.
Recycling currency translation reserves of 3 million to the income statement resulted in an overall profit on disposal of 23 million.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 193 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 3 Subsidiaries continued iii Delta Lloyd On 6 May 2011, the Group sold 25 million shares in Delta Lloyd N. V. Delta Lloyd the Groups Dutch long-term insurance, general insurance and fund management operation, reducing our holding to 42.7% of Delta Lloyds ordinary share capital, representing 40% of shareholder voting rights.
Cash consideration of 380 million was received for the sale of shares, and 8 million of costs were attributable to the disposal transaction.
The Group retained significant influence over Delta Lloyd through its initial 42.7% shareholding diluted since then to 41.9% at 31 December 2011 through Delta Lloyds issue of scrip dividends which we did not take up and contractual right to appoint two members of Delta Lloyds supervisory board.
Our continuing interest in Delta Lloyd has been classified as an associate and initially re-measured at fair value as at 6 May 2011, using the closing market value of the Delta Lloyd shares listed on Euronext on that day.
As Delta Lloyd is no longer consolidated, equity reserves for accumulated currency translation differences and accumulated fair value differences on available for sale financial investments relating to that company have been recycled to the income statement.
Equity reserves relating to Delta Lloyds owner-occupied property have been transferred directly to retained earnings.
The results of Delta Lloyd, up to the transaction date as well as those for the previous year have therefore been classified as discontinued operations.
The loss on the disposal of Delta Lloyd is calculated as follows: 2011 m Net cash proceeds from disposal 372 Fair value of continuing interest in associate at 6 May 2011 1,116 Currency translation and investment valuation equity reserves recycled to the income statement 600 Consolidated net assets of Delta Lloyd as at 6 May 2011, net of non-controlling interests 2,120 Loss on disposal recognised through the income statement 32 Avivas interest in the carrying value of Delta Lloyds IFRS net assets prior to disposal and fair value adjustments at the date of initial recognition of the associate were as follows: 2011 m Assets Goodwill 316 Acquired value of in-force business and intangible assets 59 Interests in, and loans to, joint ventures and associates 359 Property and equipment 242 Investment property 2,131 Loans 20,196 Financial investments 34,081 Deferred acquisition costs 195 Other assets 3,528 Total assets 61,107 Liabilities Insurance liabilities 32,481 Liabilities for investment contracts 3,355 Unallocated divisible surplus 144 Net asset value attributable to unitholders 631 External borrowings 6,499 Other liabilities 14,107 Total liabilities 57,217 Net assets 3,890 Non-controlling interests before disposal 1,770 Groups share of net assets before disposal 2,120 Net assets sold 14.9% 577 Fair value adjustments on initial recognition of associate 427 Residual interest in associate 1,116 The fair value adjustments represent the difference between the net asset value of the Groups residual interest in Delta Lloyd and its fair value at the transaction date, based on the market price of its listed shares on that date.
This adjustment principally comprises the fide-recognition of all previously recognised goodwill and an increase in insurance liabilities, partially offset by an increase in the value of loan investments, and adjustments to other assets and liabilities of the associate.
194 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 3 Subsidiaries continued c Assets and liabilities of operations classified as held for sale The assets and liabilities of operations classified as held for sale as at 31 December 2011 relate to our subsidiaries in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania and a joint venture in Taiwan, and are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Assets Intangible assets 1 Interests in, and loans to, joint ventures and associates 12 14 Property and equipment 1 Financial investments 347 Receivables and other financial assets 62 Prepayments and accrued income 3 Total assets 426 14 Liabilities Insurance liabilities 344 Other liabilities 19 Total liabilities 363 Net assets 63 14 During 2011, the Group decided to sell, and was actively marketing, its operations in the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania.
On 30 January 2012, we announced the sale of these businesses to MetLife, Inc.
The transaction, which is subject to regulatory approvals in each jurisdiction, is expected to be completed in 2012.
The assets and liabilities of these businesses have therefore been classified as held for sale at their expected disposal proceeds in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 December 2011.
The operations held for sale at 31 December 2010 related to our interest in the Taiwan joint venture, details of which are given in note 18 a. d Irish long-term business Our Irish long-term business is carried out through a subsidiary, Aviva Life Holdings Ireland Limited ALHI, which is 75% owned by Aviva and 25% owned by Allied Irish Bank AIB.
ALHI holds two subsidiaries, one of which is Ark Life Assurance Company Limited Ark which carries out bancassurance business via a distribution agreement with AIB.
The original distribution agreement was renewable in 2011 but, on 15 December 2011, AIB notified us that they did not wish to renew it and the existing shareholders agreement governing ALHI was terminated.
The termination of this agreement triggered the ability for both parties to exercise put and call options that will result in the unwind of the original structure such that the Ark business returns 100% to AIB and the Group will purchase the 25% minority stake in ALHI.
The formal exercise of these options was approved on 17 January 2012 and, as a result, the Ark business became held for sale on that date.
Any change in that companys ownership is subject to regulatory approval in Ireland, so completion is not expected until later in 2012.
As a result of these events, we have tested the goodwill relating to ALHIs life businesses, as well as the distribution agreement intangible asset, for impairment.
This has resulted in charges of 120 million and 44 million respectively being made in the income statement.
The shareholders agreement with AIB specifies that calculation of the Ark exit value should be based on the embedded value of the business at 31 December 2011.
This is estimated as 360 million, which is lower than its carrying value following the above impairments.
As a result, a further charge to profit of 40 million has been recognised in 2011.
The Irish business is currently reported within Europe in our segmental disclosures in note 4 a.
The obligation created by the put options over AIBs minority share in ALHI has led to our recognition of a financial liability of 205 million and an equal reduction in non-controlling interests within equity, as explained in note 37 b.

The principal activities of UK Life are life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business, while UK GI provides insurance cover to individuals and businesses, for risks associated mainly with motor vehicles, property and liability, such as employers liability and professional indemnity liability, and medical expenses.
UK GI also includes the Group reinsurance result and the results of run-off agency business, and, for the period to its disposal on 30 September 2011, the RAC motor recovery business.
Aviva Europe Activities reported in the Aviva Europe operating segment exclude operations in the UK and Delta Lloyd but include those in Russia and Turkey.
Principal activities are long-term business in France, Ireland, Italy, Poland and Spain, and general insurance in France, Ireland and Italy.

As described in note 3 b, on 6 May 2011 the Group ceased to hold a majority of the shareholder voting rights in Delta Lloyd and therefore the results of that company up to 6 May 2011 are presented as discontinued operations.
After this date, the Group ceased to consolidate Delta Lloyd.
The Groups share of the profits of its retained interest in Delta Lloyd as an associate are shown in the Delta Lloyd segment within continuing operations.
Measurement basis The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those for the Group as a whole.
Any transactions between the business segments are on normal commercial terms.
The Group evaluates performance of operating segments on the basis of: i profit or loss from operations before tax attributable to shareholders: and ii profit or loss from operations before tax attributable to shareholders, adjusted for non-operating items outside the segment managements control, including investment market performance and economic assumption changes.

For the year ended 31 December 2011, this comprised: 22 million provision for compensation scheme costs for the leveraged property fund in Ireland: and 35 million expense for the discounted cost of strengthening latent claims provisions in the UK.
For the year ended 31 December 2010, this comprised: 286 million benefit from the closure of the final salary section of the UK staff pension scheme to future accruals: and 10 million expense for the strengthening of reserves in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a significant number of years ago.

The Group focuses instead on an operating profit measure that incorporates an expected return on investments supporting its long-term business, as described below.
a Definitions Operating profit for long-term business is based on expected investment returns on financial investments backing shareholder and policyholder funds over the reporting period, with consistent allowance for the corresponding expected movements in liabilities.
Operating profit includes the effect of variance in experience for non-economic items, such as mortality, persistency and expenses, and the effect of changes in non-economic assumptions, where not treated as exceptional.
Changes due to economic items, such as market value movements and interest rate changes, which give rise to variances between actual and expected investment returns, and the impact of changes in economic assumptions on liabilities, are disclosed separately outside operating profit.
b Economic volatility The investment variances and economic assumption changes excluded from the long-term business operating profit are as follows: Long-term business 2011 2010 m m Investment variances and economic assumptions continuing operations 796 219 Investment variances and economic assumptions discontinued operations 820 1,010 Investment variances and economic assumptions 1,616 791 In 2010, investment variances of 791 million included 1,010 million relating to Delta Lloyd.
Of this, around 800 million was due to differing movements in asset and liability yield curves with the remainder primarily related to gains on interest rate derivatives.
Liabilities in Delta Lloyd are discounted using a yield curve based on a fully collateralised AAA bond portfolio.
The discount rate increased in 2010 as an increase of around 80bps in credit spreads on collateralised bonds was only partly offset by lower risk-free yields.
As a result, while lower interest rates increased the market value of assets, this was not offset by a corresponding movement in liabilities.
The AAA collateralised bond spread movement in 2010 reflected the perceived risk regarding the curves components which include bonds issued by Spanish savings banks and a range of other European organisations.
Over the period from the start of 2011 to the partial disposal of Delta Lloyd on 6 May 2011, the AAA collateralised bond spread narrowed by about 80bps as a result of changes in the underlying bond index.
This movement was the main driver of the negative variance of 820 million for discontinued operations in 2011, largely reversing the positive variance reported in the prior year.
For continuing operations, the negative investment variance of 796 million relates largely to the impact of lower risk-free interest rates, wider credit spreads and increased market volatility in the UK and Europe.
In the UK these factors have increased the cost of guarantees in the New With-Profits sub-fund.
In Europe the variance is driven by wider credit spreads on bonds in Ireland, Italy and Spain.
Any future increases in credit spreads on corporate and government bonds would cause further negative investment variances.
The overall allowances for credit defaults on UK corporate bonds and commercial mortgages remain at broadly consistent levels.
c Methodology The expected investment returns and corresponding expected movements in long-term business liabilities are calculated separately for each principal long-term business unit.
The expected return on investments for both policyholders and shareholders funds is based on opening economic assumptions applied to the expected funds under management over the reporting period.
Expected investment return assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free fixed interest assets at the end of each financial year.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields, to obtain investment return assumptions for equities and properties.
Expected funds under management are equal to the opening value of funds under management, adjusted for sales and purchases during the period arising from expected operating experience.
The actual investment return is affected by differences between the actual and expected funds under management and changes in asset mix, as well as movements in interest rates.
To the extent that these differences arise from the operating experience of the long-term business, or management decisions to change asset mix, the effect is included in the operating profit.
The residual difference between actual and expected investment return is included in investment variances, outside operating profit but included in profit before tax.
The movement in liabilities included in operating profit reflects both the change in liabilities due to the expected return on investments and the impact of experience variances and assumption changes for non-economic items.
The effect of differences between actual and expected economic experience on liabilities, and changes to economic assumptions used to value liabilities, are taken outside operating profit.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and with-profits funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
For other longterm business the profit impact of economic volatility depends on the degree of matching of assets and liabilities, and exposure to financial options and guarantees.
208 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 8 Long-term business economic volatility continued d Assumptions The expected rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return and asset classification under IFRS.
The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the expected investment return for equities and properties are: Equities Properties 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % % % United Kingdom 7.2 7.8 5.7 6.3 Eurozone 6.9 7.2 5.4 5.7 The expected return on equities and properties is calculated by reference to the ten-year swap rate in the relevant currency plus an appropriate risk margin.
These are the same assumptions as are used under MCEV principles to calculate the longer-term investment return for the Groups long-term business.
For fixed interest securities classified as FV, the expected investment returns are based on average prospective yields for the actual assets held.
Where such securities are classified as AFS, such as in the US, the expected investment return comprises the expected interest or dividend payments and amortisation of the premium or discount at purchase.
9 Longer-term investment return and economic assumption changes for non-long-term business For non-long-term business, the total investment income, including realised and unrealised gains, is split between a calculated longerterm return, which is included in operating profit, and short-term fluctuations from this, which are disclosed outside operating profit but are included in profit before tax.
This note gives details of the longer-term return calculation and the relevant assumptions, as well as the economic assumption changes on our general insurance and health business.
a The short-term fluctuations in investment return and economic assumption changes attributable to the non-long-term business result and reported outside operating profit were as follows: Non-long-term business 2011 2010 m m Short-term fluctuations in investment return see b below continuing operations 266 199 Economic assumption changes continuing operations see g below 90 61 356 260 Short-term fluctuation in investment return discontinued operations 60 44 416 304 b The longer-term investment return and short-term fluctuation for continuing operations are as follows: Non-long-term business 2011 2010 Continuing operations m m Net investment income 602 497 Foreign exchange on unrealised gains losses and other charges 99 53 503 550 Analysed between: Longer-term investment return, reported within operating profit 769 749 Short-term fluctuation in investment return, reported outside operating profit General insurance and health 124 199 Other operations 142 266 199 503 550 Mainly represents assets backing non-long-term business held by the France holding company.
c The longer-term investment return is calculated separately for each principal non-long-term business unit.
In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer-term rate of investment return.
The longer-term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer-term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
Actual income and longer-term investment return both contain the amortisation of the discounts premium arising on the acquisition of fixed income securities.
For other operations, the longer-term return mainly reflects assets backing nonlong-term business held in the France holding company.

As explained in accounting policy K, provisions for latent claims are discounted, using rates based on the relevant swap curve, in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of the claims.
The discount rate is set at the start of the accounting period, with any change in rates between the start and end of the accounting period being reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.

13 Tax This note analyses the tax credit charge for the year and explains the factors that affect it.
a Tax credited charged to the income statement i The total tax credit charge comprises: 2011 2010 Continuing operations m m Current tax For this year 539 583 Prior year adjustments 16 44 Total current tax from continuing operations 523 539 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of temporary differences 514 280 Changes in tax rates or tax laws 28 35 Write-down back of deferred tax assets 70 67 Total deferred tax from continuing operations 472 178 Total tax charged to income statement from continuing operations 51 717 Total tax credited charged to income statement from discontinued operations 202 225 Total tax credited charged to income statement 151 942 ii The Group, as a proxy for policyholders in the UK, Ireland and Singapore, is required to record taxes on investment income and gains each year.
Accordingly, the tax benefit or expense attributable to UK, Irish and Singapore life insurance policyholder returns is included in the tax credit charge.
The tax credit attributable to policyholders returns included in the credit above is 178 million 2010: 394 million charge.
iii The tax credit charge can be analysed as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK tax 304 447 Overseas tax 153 495 151 942 iv Unrecognised tax losses and temporary differences of previous years were used to reduce the current tax expense and deferred tax expense by 25 million and 108 million 2010: 34 million and 88 million, respectively.

c Tax credited to equity Tax credited directly to equity in the year amounted to 16 million 2010: 17 million, and is wholly in respect of coupon payments on direct capital instruments.
d Tax reconciliation The tax on the Groups loss profit before tax differs from the theoretical amount that would arise using the tax rate of the home country of the Company as follows: 2011 PolicyShareholder holder Total m m m Total profit loss before tax 87 178 91 Tax calculated at standard UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% 23 47 24 Reconciling items Different basis of tax policyholders 129 129 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior years 25 25 Non-assessable income 60 60 Non-taxable profit on sale of subsidiaries and associates 135 135 Disallowable expenses 215 215 Different local basis of tax on overseas profits 84 2 82 Change in future local statutory tax rates 32 32 Movement in deferred tax not recognised 5 5 Tax effect of profit from associates and joint ventures 41 41 Other 3 3 Total tax charged credited to income statement 27 178 151 2010 PolicyShareholder holder Total m m m Total profit before tax 2,440 394 2,834 Tax calculated at standard UK corporation tax rate of 28% 684 110 794 Reconciling items Different basis of tax policyholders 272 272 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of prior years 28 28 Non-assessable income 93 93 Non-taxable profit on sale of subsidiaries and associates 44 44 Disallowable expenses 142 142 Different local basis of tax on overseas profits 95 95 Change in future local statutory tax rates 26 26 Movement in deferred tax not recognised 156 156 Tax effect of profit from associates and joint ventures 4 4 Other 22 12 10 Total tax charged to income statement 548 394 942 214 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 13 Tax continued The tax credit charge attributable to policyholders' returns is removed from the Groups total loss profit before tax in arriving at the Groups profits before tax attributable to shareholders' profits.
As the net of tax profits attributable to with-profit and unit-linked policyholders is zero, the Groups pre-tax loss profit attributable to policyholders is an amount equal and opposite to the tax credit charge attributable to policyholders included in the total tax credit charge.
The difference between the policyholder tax credit charge and the impact of this item in the tax reconciliation can be explained as follows: 2011 2010 m m Tax attributable to policyholder returns 178 394 UK corporation tax at a rate of 26.5% 2010: 28% in respect of the policyholder tax deduction 47 110 Other life insurance regime impacts 12 Different local basis of tax on overseas profits 2 Different basis of tax policyholders per tax reconciliation 129 272 A reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted in March 2011 and was effective from 1 April 2011.
A further reduction from 26% to 25% was substantively enacted in July 2011 and will be effective from 1 April 2012.
Accordingly, these rates have been applied in the measurement of the Groups deferred tax assets and liabilities as at 31 December 2011.
In addition, the Government announced its intention to further reduce the UK corporation tax rate to 24% from 1 April 2013 and to 23% from 1 April 2014.
The aggregate impact of the proposed reductions from 25% to 23% would reduce the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by approximately 60 million.
Considerable changes to the regime for taxing UK life insurance companies will be made with effect from 1 January 2013.
Draft legislation on this was included in the draft 2012 Finance Bill published on 6 December 2011, and consultation on the changes and the draft legislation has continued since then.
Based on the draft legislation published in December 2011 and the continued consultation, it is not expected that these changes will have a material impact on the deferred tax assets and liabilities shown in the consolidated statement of financial position.

The tests led to impairment of goodwill of 160 million in 2011 2010: 3 million.
Goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives have been tested for impairment in these businesses as follows: United Kingdom i Long-term business As part of the annual review of goodwill, management have considered the recoverability of the goodwill balance associated with the two cash generating units representing the UK Creditor Life business and the UK Occupational Health business.
As a result of deteriorating prospects for these businesses, management have concluded that the goodwill in these businesses is no longer recoverable and an impairment of 29 million has been recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement during the year.
ii General insurance and health The recoverable amount of the UK General Insurance and health business exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the UK general insurance and health unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The calculation uses cash flow projections based on business plans approved by management covering a three-year period.
Cash flows beyond that three-year period have been extrapolated using a steady 1.25% 2010: 2.5% growth rate and a risk-adjusted discount rate of 8.2% 2010: 9.3%.
This growth rate is set with regards to past experience and historical statistics of UK premium growth published by the Association of British Insurers.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management, and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the relevant UK industry sectors: Some of the assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, customer numbers, premium rate and fee income changes, claims inflation and commission rates: and Growth rates represent the rates used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period and have been based upon latest information available regarding future and past growth rates, including external sources of data such as ABI Annual Market Statistics.
Following its disposal, the RAC business no longer forms part of this cash-generating unit.
220 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 16 Goodwill continued Europe i Long-term business The recoverable amount of long-term business cash-generating units in the Europe region, with the exception of France, was determined based on a value in use calculation.
The first step of the test was to compare the carrying value of each cash-generating unit, including goodwill, to the MCEV of that cash-generating unit.
If the MCEV is less than the carrying value of a cash generating unit, the present value of profits from expected new business for that cash-generating unit is considered.
If the value of profits from expected new business for a cash-generating unit is expected to grow beyond the period of the initial plan, this growth rate is set with regard to past experience in each market and market expectations of future growth in each country.
For European long-term business cash-generating units, with the exception of France, a key assumption used for the calculation was the embedded value which represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the MCEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth and the value of the in-force life business.
ii General insurance, health and other The recoverable amount of general insurance, health and other non-life cash-generating units in Europe was determined based on a value in use calculation.
Value in use is calculated for each cash-generating unit using a discounted cash flow projection based on business plans and growth assumptions approved by management for each cash-generating unit and discounted at a risk discount rate appropriate for each cash-generating unit.
If the cash flows are expected to grow beyond the period of the initial plan, this growth rate is set with regard to past experience in each market and market expectations of future growth in each country.
iii France long-term business The recoverable amount of the indefinite life intangible asset has been assessed based on the fair value less costs to sell of the cashgenerating unit to which it relates.
The fair value less costs to sell was determined based on the quoted market value of the share of interest in the subsidiary to which it relates.
The fair value less costs to sell of the cash-generating unit was greater than its carrying value, including indefinite life intangible assets.
iv Ireland long-term business Following the announcement of the termination of Aviva Irelands bancassurance distribution contract see note 3 d, management have concluded that the goodwill associated with the Irish long-term business is not recoverable as a result of the reduction in expected volumes of future new business.
A goodwill impairment loss of 120 million has therefore been recognised, reducing the carrying value of goodwill relating to this business to nil.
v Ireland general insurance and health The recoverable amount of the Irish general insurance and health business exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit, including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit for an initial three-year period which represents the operating profit in the business plans, approved by management and reflecting the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Irish economy.
The assumptions that underline the budgeted operating profit include market share, premium rate changes, claims inflation and commission rates: Future cash flows are extrapolated beyond the three-year business plan period assuming 2% 2010: nil growth for general insurance business and a nil growth rate for the health business: and A risk-adjusted discount rate of 13.7% 2010: 10.8%.
The recoverable amount for the cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying value by 6 million.
An increase in the risk adjusted discount rate by 27 basis points would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value.
vi Italy long-term business The recoverable amount calculation is an actuarially determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
Key assumptions in addition to MCEV principles used for the calculation were: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 3% 2010: 3% : and Risk-adjusted discount rate of 4.85% 2010: 6.5% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate is a combination of a risk-free rate and a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
The MCEV principles applied to project future cash flows include allowance for many of the risks associated with these cash flows, and therefore these risks are not also reflected in the discount rate applied to calculate a present value of future cash flows.
The recovery of goodwill in the Italy long-term business is dependent on future performance being in line with current plans.
The future performance assumptions are inherently uncertain and dependant on local economic conditions.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 221 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 16 Goodwill continued vii Italy non-life The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating units including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Budgeted operating profit for an initial three-year period represents the operating profit in the most recent business plans, approved by management and as such reflects the best estimate of future profits based on both historical experience and expected growth rates for the Italian economy: and Growth rate of 3% 2010: 3% represents the rate used to extrapolate future cash flows beyond the business plan period: and a risk-adjusted discount rate of 10.3% 2010: 10.8%.
As a result of this test, an impairment of 11 million has been recognised in respect of Aviva Assicurazioni Vita Spa.
The impairment arose as a result of a reduction in managements estimates for the future profitability of the business due to current economic circumstances.
The recoverable amount of the Avipop Assicurazioni cash-generating unit exceeds its carrying value by 1.3million.
An adjustment to the discount rate used to calculate the present value of expected future profits of 100 basis points would result in the recoverable amount being equal to the carrying value.
viii Spain long-term business The recoverable amount of the Spanish long-term business exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill.
This calculation is an actuarially determined appraisal value and is based on the embedded value of the business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
This is initially based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 3% 2010: 3% : and Risk-adjusted discount rate of 5.3% 2010: 5.6% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The MCEV principles applied to project future cash flows include allowance for many of the risks associated with these cash flows, and therefore these risks are not also reflected in the discount rate applied to reach a present value.
In addition to estimating the recoverable value of the Spain cash-generating unit, management considered the terms of the contractual arrangements with bancassurance partners.
Management further considered the range of outcomes from the ongoing re-organisation of the Caja market and insurance distribution arrangements mandated by the Spanish government, including ongoing arbitration with one of our bancassurance partners.
Management concluded that, under a range of reasonably possible scenarios, the contractual terms support the recoverability of the carrying value of the cash-generating unit.
ix United States long-term business The recoverable amount of the US long-term business exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill.
The recoverable amount of the US long-term cash-generating unit has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
This calculation is an actuarially determined appraisal value and is based on an embedded value of the business the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business together with the present value of expected profits from future new business.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is based on projected cash flows of the business including expected investment returns: Risk-adjusted discount rate of 8% 2010: 8% is used to calculate the embedded value: New business contribution represents the present value of projected future profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management: Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 5% 2010: 3% for life business and 3% 2010: 3% for annuity business, which is set with regard to past experience in these markets: and Risk-adjusted discount rate of 10% 2010: 10% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate includes an additional margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.
Cash flow projections To comply with paragraph 33 c of IAS 36, cash flow projections for the period beyond the three-year plan period are extrapolated from the position in the final year of the three-year plan period.
In all cases, we have assumed a positive or nil steady growth rate for subsequent years, not an increasing growth rate.
The steady growth rate selected for each cash-generating unit reflects long-term expectations for the markets in which each cash-generating unit participates.
Impairment tests for all cash-generating units have been performed using assumptions which management believe are reasonable.
Except where specifically noted in the discussion of impairment testing above, given the magnitude of the excess of recoverable value over carrying amount in each case, management believe that it is not reasonably possible that there would be a change in the key assumptions such that the carrying amount would exceed the recoverable value.

a Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives comprise the RAC brand until disposal on 30 September 2011, and the value of the Union Financire fide France Banque distribution channel, where the existing lives of the assets and their competitive position in, and the stability of, their respective markets support this classification.
Impairment testing of these intangibles is covered in note 16 b. b Acquisitions of intangible assets with finite lives relate to Canadian broker businesses.
c Other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of the value of bancassurance and other distribution agreements.
d Impairment losses on intangible assets with finite lives arise from the assessment of the recoverable amount of the Ireland longterm insurance business.
The methods and assumptions used in this assessment are as discussed in Note 16 b iv.
This assessment resulted in an impairment of 44 million.
Other impairments have arisen in the French long-term insurance business.
Impairment losses in respect of AVIF on insurance contracts have arisen in the US long-term business.

i Aviva-COFCO Life Insurance Co. Limited The Groups investment in Aviva-COFCO Life Insurance Co. Limited has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on value in use calculations.
This calculation is an actuarially determined appraisal value and is based on the MCEV embedded value of the business.
The key assumptions used in the test were the MCEV principles.
The MCEV of Aviva-COFCO Life Insurance Co. Limited exceeds its carrying value.
Aviva-COFCO Life Insurance Co. Limited is a developing business and the recoverability of value is reliant on future projected growth being achieved.
These projections are inherently uncertain and dependent on local economic conditions.
ii CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad The Groups investments in CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad have been tested for impairment by comparing their carrying values which include goodwill which arose on their acquisition with their recoverable amounts.
The recoverable amounts for both the investments have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The recoverable amounts exceed the carrying values of both the investments.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Cash flow projections based on: i the policy portfolio expected at the valuation date: and ii the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three-year period.
The cash flows from the existing policy portfolio are calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience investigations where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available: The embedded value for existing business was derived using risk free rates: The value in use was derived as the sum of embedded value of existing business and the new business contribution in each future year discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate of 13.9% 2010: 13.8% : and New sales beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using a growth rate of 10% 2010: 10%.
CIMB Aviva Assurance Berhad and CIMB Aviva Takaful Berhad are developing businesses and the recoverability of value is reliant on the achievement of future projected growth.
iii AvivaSA Emeklilik five Hayat A. S. The Groups investment in AvivaSA Emeklilik five Hayat A. S. has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on its acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been determined based on a value in use calculation.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the cash-generating unit including goodwill.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Embedded value represents the shareholder interest in the life business and is calculated in accordance with the MCEV principles.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life business and the value of the in-force business.
New business contribution represents the present value of projected future distributable profits generated from business written in a period.
This is initially based on the most recent three-year business plans approved by management.
Growth rate represents the rate used to extrapolate new business contributions beyond the business plan period, and is based on managements estimate of future growth of 4% 2010: 3%.
Risk adjusted discount rate of 12.8% 2010: 14.6% represents the rate used to discount expected profits from future new business.
The discount rate reflects a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years for new business may differ from that assumed.

i Change in status of Delta Lloyd As described in note 3 b, the Groups shareholding in Delta Lloyd N. V. Delta Lloyd was reduced to 42.7%, representing 40% of shareholder voting rights, following the sale of shares on 6 May 2011.
This transaction was recognised as the deconsolidation of a subsidiary and the acquisition of an associate.
The Groups interest in Delta Lloyd has since been diluted to 41.91% through its offering of scrip dividends which we did not take up shows as reduction in Group interests above.
Associates held by Delta Lloyd itself, previously recognised through its consolidation, were included in the deconsolidation and incorporated into the acquisition value of Delta Lloyd as an associate.
ii Additions Additions in 2011 relate to the Groups Indian associate.
b Principal associates The principal associates included above are: Country of incorporation and Company Type of business Proportion held operation Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited Insurance 26.00% India Delta Lloyd N. V. Financial Services 41.91% Netherlands The Group controls 39.3% of the shareholder voting rights in Delta Lloyd.
All investments in principal associates are held by subsidiaries.
With the exception of Delta Lloyd, all are unlisted.
Delta Lloyd is listed on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam and the quoted value of the Groups investment in this company at 31 December 2011 was 776 million.
228 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 19 Interests in, and loans to, associates continued c Additional information Summarised aggregate financial information on the Groups interests in its associates is as follows: 2011 2010 Delta Lloyd Other total total m m m m Share of revenues 2,139 105 2,244 163 Share of results before tax 167 29 196 16 Share of assets 25,491 466 25,957 803 Share of liabilities 24,715 239 24,954 240 Share of net assets 776 227 1,003 563 As Delta Lloyd only became an associate in May 2011, the 2010 comparatives relate to other companies.
The Groups share of associated companies contingent liabilities amounted to 173 million at 31 December 2011.
There were no significant contingent liabilities to which the Group was exposed in 2010. d Impairment testing All interests in associates have been tested for impairment but only the material items are detailed below.
i Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited The Groups investment in Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited has been tested for impairment by comparing its carrying value which includes goodwill which arose on their acquisition with its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value of the investment.
Key assumptions used for the calculation were: Cash flow projections based on: i the policy portfolio existing at the valuation date: and ii the future sales based on plans approved by management covering the subsequent three-year period.
The cash flows from the existing policy portfolio are calculated using best estimate assumptions, which have been supported by experience investigations where available and prudent estimates typical for the market where experience investigations are not available: iii New sales beyond the three-year period have been extrapolated using an implied growth rate of 3.2% 2010: 14% for seven years and 10% thereafter.
The embedded value for existing business was derived using risk free rates: The value in use was derived as the sum of the embedded value of existing business and the new business contribution in each future year discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate of 18.4% 2010: 17.3% : and Aviva Life Insurance Company India Limited is a developing business and the recoverability of value is reliant on the achievement of future projected growth.
In addition, local regulatory changes have resulted in changes to the types of product that can be sold.
The growth projections are inherently uncertain and dependent on local economic and regulatory conditions.
ii Delta Lloyd N. V. The recoverable amount of Delta Lloyd N. V. has been determined based on fair value less costs to sell.
The fair value has been calculated based on the market price of ordinary shares of Delta Lloyd N. V. quoted on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam as at 31 December 2011.
As a result of this test an impairment of 217 million has been recognised in respect of the associate, reducing its carrying amount to fair value.

Owner-occupied properties are stated at their revalued amounts, as assessed by qualified external valuers.
These values are assessed in accordance with the relevant parts of the current RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards in the UK, and with current local valuation practices in other countries.
This assessment, on the basis of existing use value and in accordance with UK Practice Statement 1.3, is the estimated amount for which a property should exchange on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms-length transaction, after proper marketing wherein the parties had acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion, assuming that the buyer is granted vacant possession of all parts of the property required by the business and disregarding potential alternative uses.
The valuation assessment adopts market-based evidence and is in line with guidance from the International Valuation Standards Committee and the requirements of IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment.
Similar considerations apply to properties under construction, where an estimate is made of valuation when complete, adjusted for anticipated costs to completion, profit and risk, reflecting market conditions at the valuation date.
Our West Des Moines office in the United States was only completed and occupied in 2010, so it is held at its construction cost of 87 million until the next valuation in 2013.
If owner-occupied properties were stated on a historical cost basis, the carrying amount would be 189 million 2010: 347 million.
The Group has no material finance leases for property and equipment.

Values are calculated using a discounted cash flow approach and are based on current rental income plus anticipated uplifts at the next rent review, assuming no future growth in rental income.
This uplift and the discount rate are derived from rates implied by recent market transactions on similar properties.
The fair value of investment properties leased to third parties under operating leases at 31 December 2011 was 11,552 million 2010: 12,924 million.
Future contractual aggregate minimum lease rentals receivable under the non-cancellable portion of these leases are given in note 52 b i.
22 Fair value methodology This note explains the methodology for valuing our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, and provides an analysis of these according to a fair value hierarchy, determined by the market observability of valuation inputs.
a Basis for determining fair value hierarchy of financial instruments For financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value, we have categorised the measurement basis into a fair value hierarchy as follows: Quoted market prices in active markets Level 1 Inputs to Level 1 fair values are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
An active market is one in which transactions for the asset or liability occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
Examples are listed equities in active markets, listed debt securities in active markets and quoted unit trusts in active markets.
Modelled with significant observable market inputs Level 2 Inputs to Level 2 fair values are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the instrument.
Level 2 inputs include the following: Quoted prices for similar i. e. not identical assets and liabilities in active markets.
Quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, the prices are not current, or price quotations vary substantially either over time or among market makers, or in which little information is released publicly.
Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability for example, interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals, volatilities, prepayment spreads, loss severities, credit risks and default rates.
Inputs that are derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data by correlation or other means marketcorroborated inputs.
Examples of these are securities measured using discounted cash flow models based on market observable swap yields, and listed debt or equity securities in a market that is inactive.
Valuations, whether sourced from internal models or third parties, incorporate credit risk by adjusting the spread above the yield curve for government treasury securities for the appropriate amount of credit risk for each issuer, based on observed market transactions.
To the extent observed market spreads are either not used in valuing a security, or do not fully reflect liquidity risk, our valuation methodology, whether sourced from internal models or third parties, reflects a liquidity premium.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 231 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 22 Fair value methodology continued Where we use broker quotes and no information as to the observability of inputs is provided by the broker, we generally validate the price quoted by the broker by using internal models with observable inputs.
When the price obtained from the broker and internal model are similar, we look to the inputs used in our internal model to understand the observability of the inputs used by the broker.
In circumstances where internal models are not used to validate broker prices, and the observability of inputs used by brokers is unavailable, the investment is classified as Level 3.
Broker quotes are usually non-binding.
Modelled with significant unobservable market inputs Level 3 Inputs to Level 3 fair values are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Unobservable inputs may have been used to measure fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available, thereby allowing for situations in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date or market information for the inputs to any valuation models.
As such, unobservable inputs reflect the assumptions the business unit considers that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability.
Examples are certain private equity investments and private placements.
The majority of the Groups financial assets and certain financial liabilities are valued based on quoted market information or observable market data.
A small percentage 4.8% of total financial assets recorded at fair value are based on estimates and recorded as Level 3 investments.
Where estimates are used, these are based on a combination of independent third-party evidence and internally developed models, calibrated to market observable data where possible.
Third-party valuations using significant unobservable inputs validated against Level 2 internally modelled valuations are classified as Level 3, where there is a significant difference between the third-party price and the internally modelled value.
Where the difference is insignificant, the instrument would be classified as Level 2. b Fair value hierarchy analysis An analysis of financial assets and liabilities according to fair value hierarchy is given below: 2011 Fair value hierarchy Less: Assets of operations Statement classified of financial Sub-total Amortised as held position Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 fair value cost for sale Total m m m m m m m Financial investments and loans notes 25 and 23 Loans 18,486 18,486 9,630 28,116 Fixed maturity securities 103,183 42,222 7,940 153,345 93 153,252 Equity securities 31,556 644 483 32,683 37 32,646 Other investments including derivatives 21,902 5,530 2,945 30,377 217 30,160 Total 156,641 66,882 11,368 234,891 9,630 347 244,174 Financial liabilities Non-participating investments contracts note 40 42,523 1,219 248 43,990 1,669 45,659 Borrowings note 48 1,306 1,306 7,144 8,450 Derivative liabilities note 49 446 1,360 44 1,850 1,850 Total 42,969 3,885 292 47,146 8,813 55,959 Discussion on the valuation techniques applied to value financial liabilities carried at fair value is included in the relevant footnote disclosure for the financial liability.
For the year to 31 December 2011, transfers of financial assets from fair value hierarchy Level 1 to Level 2 amounted to 2.2 billion 2010: 517 million, and 9 million 2010: 289 million from Level 2 to Level 1.
The transfers from Level 1 to Level 2 arose primarily in France 1.9 billion and the UK 0.3 billion as a result of changes in the level of activity and environment in the markets from which prices are sourced.
For the year to 31 December 2011, there were no transfers of financial liabilities between fair value hierarchy levels 2010: 2,305 million of borrowings moved from Level 2 to Level 1.

Transfers between fair value hierarchy levels are deemed to have occurred at the assessment date.
Transfers into and out of Level 3 for the year arose for the following reasons: Changes in the market observability of valuation inputs.
Changes in the market observability of inputs used to validate valuations.
Significant differences between third-party prices used for valuations and validation prices either sourced from third parties or internal models.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 233 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 22 Fair value methodology continued The transfers into and out of Level 3 in 2011 are spread across our businesses in the UK, Italy, the US and France and across a number of asset classes, with no single business or asset class predominating.
There are a variety of reasons for these transfers, including change in market activity in valuation inputs, transparency of valuation inputs from third-party pricing sources and matching between internal model valuations and broker quotes.
Of the 387 million net losses 2010: 247 million net gains recognised in the income statement during the year, a 390 million loss 2010: 252 million gain is recognised in net investment income and a 3 million gain 2010: 5 million loss relates to impairments and is included in other expenses.
ii The principal investments classified as Level 3, and the valuation techniques applied to them, are: Structured bond-type products held by our business in France amounting to 6.1 billion, for which there is no active market.
These bonds are valued either using third-party counterparty or broker quotes.
These bonds are validated against internal or third-party models.
These bonds have been classified as Level 3 because either i the third-party models included a significant unobservable liquidity adjustment or ii differences between the valuation provided by the counterparty and broker quotes and the validation model were sufficiently significant to result in a Level 3 classification.
At 31 December 2011, the values reported in respect of these products were the lower of counterparty and broker quotes and modelled valuations.
Notes issued by loan partnerships held by our UK Life business amounting to 1.2 billion, for which there is no active market.
These are valued using counterparty quotes, corroborated against the prices of selected similar securities.
In 2011, there were insufficient market observable transactions in the selected securities to provide a reliable proxy price to corroborate the counterparty price.
In addition, our UK Life business owns part of the residual equity interest in these loan partnerships valued at 0.2 billion according to net asset values, which are not considered market observable, resulting in a Level 3 classification.
Private equity investment funds amounting to 1.5 billion, of which 0.9 billion is held by our UK business.
In valuing our interest in these funds, we rely on investment valuation reports received from the fund manager, making adjustments for items such as subsequent draw-downs and distributions between the date of the report and the balance sheet date and the fund managers carried interest.
In addition, an indexation adjustment is made to reflect changes in appropriate equity market indices between the valuation report date and balance sheet date.
External hedge funds held principally by businesses in the UK, the US and France amounting to 1.3 billion.
Valuations received from fund managers are based on net asset values.
However, insufficient information is provided on the underlying fund assets to support a classification other than Level 3.
Certain strategic interests in banking partners held by our Italian business amounting to 0.3 billion.
Valuations are based on third-party independent appraisals, or where internally modelled, transactions in similar entities, discounted cash flow techniques and valuation multiples, using public and internal management information.
Other Level 3 investments amount to 0.8 billion and relate to a diverse range of different types of securities held by a number of businesses throughout the Group.
iii Where possible, the Group tests the sensitivity of the fair values of Level 3 investments to changes in unobservable inputs to reasonable alternatives.
99% 2010: 95% of valuations for Level 3 investments are sourced from independent third parties and, where appropriate, validated against internally modelled valuations, third-party models or broker quotes.
Where third-party pricing sources are unwilling to provide a sensitivity analysis for their valuations, the Group undertakes, where feasible, sensitivity analysis on the following basis: For third-party valuations validated against internally modelled valuations using significant unobservable inputs, the sensitivity of the internally modelled valuation to changes in unobservable inputs to a reasonable alternative is determined.
For third-party valuations either not validated or validated against a third-party model or broker quote, the third-party valuation in its entirety is considered an unobservable input.
Sensitivities are determined by flexing to a reasonable alternative the yield, NAV multiple, IRR or other suitable valuation multiples of the financial instrument implied by the third-party valuation.
For example, for a fixed income security the implied yield would be the rate of return which discounts the securitys contractual cash flows to equal the third-party valuation.
On the basis of the methodology outlined above, the Group is able to perform sensitivity analysis for 3.8 billion of the Groups Level 3 investments.
For these Level 3 investments, changing unobservable valuation inputs to a reasonable alternative would result in a change in fair value in the range of 114 million positive impact and 114 million adverse impact.
Of the 7.6 billion Level 3 investments for which sensitivity analysis is not provided, 0.3 billion and 6.4 billion relate to investments held in unit-linked and participating funds respectively in Italy and France.
For these products, investment risk is predominantly borne by policyholders and therefore shareholder profit before tax is insensitive to reasonable changes in fair value of these investments.
Level 3 investments backing non-linked shareholder-backed business, for which no sensitivity analysis is provided, amount to only 0.7 billion.
A 10% change in valuation of these investments would reduce shareholder profit before tax by 74 million.
234 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 23 Loans This note analyses the loans our Group companies have made, the majority of which are mortgage loans.

The obligation to repay this collateral is included in payables and other financial liabilities note 49.
Of the above loans, 21,626 million 2010: 35,581 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
Loans at fair value Fair values have been calculated by discounting the future cash flows using appropriate current interest rates for each portfolio of mortgages.
Further details of the fair value methodology are given in note 22.
The change in fair value of these loans during the year, attributable to a change in credit risk, was a loss of 239 million 2010: 85 million loss.
The cumulative change attributable to changes in credit risk to 31 December 2011 was a loss of 689 million 2010: 400 million loss.
Non-securitised mortgage loans include 501 million 2010: 215 million relating to UK primary healthcare and PFI businesses which are secured against General Practitioner premises, other primary health-related premises or schools leased to government bodies.
For all such loans, government support is provided through reimbursement of rental payments to the tenants to meet income service and provide for the debt to be reduced substantially over the term of the loan.
Although the loan principal is not Governmentguaranteed, the nature of these businesses and premises provides considerable comfort of an ongoing business model and low risk of default.
Loans at amortised cost The fair value of these loans at 31 December 2011 was 9,532 million 2010: 21,784 million.

This collateral generally takes the form of liens or charges over properties and, in the case of policy loans, the underlying policy for the majority of the loan balances above.
In all other situations, the collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title for the collateral received always occurs in such cases, although no market risk or benefit is taken.
In the event of a default, the Group is able to sell or repledge the collateral.
The amount of collateral received with respect to loans which the Group is permitted to sell or repledge in the absence of default was 4,601 million 2010: 4,542 million.
No collateral was actually sold or repledged in the absence of default during the year 2010: nil.
236 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 24 Securitised mortgages and related assets The Group, in our UK Life and prior to its deconsolidation Dutch businesses, has loans receivable, secured by mortgages, which have then been securitised through non-recourse borrowings.
This note gives details of the relevant transactions.
a Description of current arrangements In a UK long-term business subsidiary, Aviva Equity Release UK Limited AER, the beneficial interest in certain portfolios of lifetime mortgages has been transferred to five special purpose securitisation companies the ERF companies, in return for initial consideration and, at later dates, deferred consideration.
The deferred consideration represents receipts accrued within the ERF companies after meeting all their obligations to the note holders, loan providers and other third parties in the priority of payments.
The purchases of the mortgages were funded by the issue of fixed and floating rate notes by the ERF companies.
All the shares in the ERF companies are held by independent companies, whose shares are held on trust.
Although AER does not own, directly or indirectly, any of the share capital of the ERF companies or their parent companies, it retains control of the majority of the residual or ownership risks and rewards related to the assets of the securitisation companies, and they have therefore been treated as subsidiaries in the consolidated financial statements.
AER has no right to repurchase the benefit of any of the securitised mortgage loans, other than in certain circumstances where AER is in breach of warranty or loans are substituted in order to effect a further advance.
AER has purchased subordinated notes and granted subordinated loans to some of the ERF companies.
These have been eliminated on consolidation through offset against the borrowings of the ERF companies in the consolidated statement of financial position.
In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the note holders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that note holders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that note holders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.

The majority of the Groups stock lending transactions occur in the UK, where investments are lent to EEA-regulated, locally domiciled counterparties and governed by agreements written under English law.
Non-cash collateral received The Group receives collateral in order to reduce the credit risk of these arrangements.
Collateral must be in a readily realisable form, such as listed securities, and is held in segregated accounts.
Transfer of title always occurs for collateral received, although no market risk or economic benefit is taken.
The level of collateral held is monitored regularly, with further collateral obtained where this is considered necessary to manage the Groups risk exposure.
In certain markets, the Group or the Groups appointed stock lending managers obtain legal ownership of the collateral received and can re-pledge it as collateral elsewhere or sell outright in the absence of default.
The carrying amount of financial assets received in this manner at 31 December 2011 was 15,778 million 2010: 15,858 million.
The value of collateral that was actually sold in the absence of default was 150 million 2010: nil.
Cash collateral received In addition to the above, the Group has received cash collateral under stock lending arrangements that has been recognised in the statement of financial position with a corresponding obligation for its return.
The latter balance is included in note 49. ii Stock repurchase arrangements Included within financial investments are nil 2010: 853 million of debt securities and other fixed income securities which have been sold under stock repurchase arrangements.
The obligations arising under these arrangements are shown in note 49. iii Other arrangements In carrying on its bulk purchase annuity business, the Groups UK Life operation is required to place certain investments in trust on behalf of the policyholders.
Amounts become payable from the trust funds to the trustees if the Group were to be in breach of its payment obligations in respect of policyholder benefits.
At 31 December 2011 1,044 million 2010: 909 million of financial investments were restricted in this way.
Certain financial investments are also required to be deposited under local laws in various overseas countries as security for the holders of policies issued in those countries.
Other investments are pledged as security collateral for bank letters of credit.

Amortisation increased by 153 million in 2011, mainly in the UK and the US, where DAC balances, and the amortisation thereof, are increasing, driven by the growing volumes of business and emergence of profits from the business.
Where amortisation of the DAC balance depends on projected profits, changes to economic conditions may lead to a movement in the DAC balance and a corresponding impact on profit.
It is estimated that the movement in the DAC balance would reduce profit by 145 million if market yields on fixed income investments were to increase by 1% and increase profit by 170 million if yields were to reduce by 1%.

Shares which do not vest will lapse.
iii Shares to satisfy awards and options Prior to March 2003, it was the practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the Groups share plans through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for the purpose of satisfying awards under the Groups share plans and funded by the Company.
From March 2003 to July 2008, it was generally the Companys practice to satisfy the awards granted after March 2003 by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting.
However, since July 2008, it has been the Companys practice to satisfy all awards and options using shares purchased in the market and held by employee trusts except where local regulations make it necessary to issue new shares.
Further details are given in note 31. c Movements in the year A summary of the status of the option plans as at 31 December 2010 and 2011, and changes during the years ended on those dates, is shown below.

i Share options The fair value of the options was estimated on the date of grant, based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2011 2010 Share price 312p 402p Exercise price 268p 310p Expected volatility 58% 56% Expected life 3.64 years 5.00 years Expected dividend yield 6.40% 6.09% Risk-free interest rate 0.89% 1.57% The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option prior to its date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate was based on the yields available on UK government bonds as at the date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the options.
182,907 options granted after 7 November 2002 were exercised during the year 2010: 64,903. ii Share awards The fair value of the awards was estimated on the date of grant based on the following weighted average assumptions: Weighted average assumption 2011 2010 Share price 435.70p 386.00p Expected volatility 66% 66% Expected volatility of comparator companies share price 65% 65% Correlation between Aviva and competitors share price 57% 57% Expected life 3.00 years 2.75 years Expected dividend yield n a 7.70% Risk-free interest rate 1.79% 1.80% For awards with market-based performance conditions.
The Long-Term Incentive Plan awards granted in 2011 include additional shares being provided to employees equal to dividend rights before vesting.
As a result, no dividend yield assumption is required for these awards.
The expected volatility used was based on the historical volatility of the share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the share award prior to its date of grant.
The bonds chosen were those with a similar remaining term to the expected life of the share awards.
31 Shares held by employee trusts We satisfy awards and options granted under the Groups share plans primarily through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts.
This note gives details of the shares held in these trusts.

250 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 32 Preference share capital This note gives details of Aviva plcs preference share capital.
The preference share capital of the Company at 31 December 2011 was: 2011 2010 m m Issued and paid up 3 100,000,000 8 8% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 3 100,000,000 8 4% cumulative irredeemable preference shares of 1 each 100 100 200 200 Under its articles of association, the Company may issue and allot Sterling New Preference Shares and Euro New Preference Shares, which, if issued and allotted, would rank, as to payment of a dividend and capital, ahead of the Companys ordinary share capital but behind the cumulative irredeemable preference shares currently in issue.
The issued preference shares are non-voting except where their dividends are in arrears, on a winding up or where their rights are altered.
On a winding up, they carry a preferential right of return of capital ahead of the ordinary shares.
The Company does not have a contractual obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets to the preference shareholders and therefore the directors may make dividend payments at their discretion.
33 Direct capital instruments This note gives details of the direct capital instruments issued in November 2004.

They have no fixed redemption date but the Company may, at its sole option, redeem all but not part of the euro and sterling DCIs at their principal amounts on 28 November 2014 and 27 July 2020 respectively, at which dates the interest rates change to variable rates, or on any respective coupon payment date thereafter.
In addition, under certain circumstances defined in the terms and conditions of the issue, the Company may at its sole option: substitute at any time not less than all of the DCIs for, or vary the terms of the DCIs so that they become Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities: or substitute not less than all of the DCIs for fully paid non-cumulative preference shares in the Company.
These preference shares could only be redeemed on 28 November 2014 in the case of the euro DCIs and on 27 July 2020 in the case of the sterling DCIs, or in each case on any dividend payment date thereafter.
The Company has the right to choose whether or not to pay any dividend on the new shares, and any such dividend payment will be non-cumulative.
The Company has the option to defer coupon payments on the DCIs on any relevant payment date.
Deferred coupons shall be satisfied only in the following circumstances, all of which occur at the sole option of the Company: Redemption: or Substitution by, or variation so they become, alternative Qualifying Tier 1 Securities or Qualifying Upper Tier 2 Securities: or Substitution by preference shares.
No interest will accrue on any deferred coupon.
Deferred coupons will be satisfied by the issue and sale of ordinary shares in the Company at their prevailing market value, to a sum as near as practicable to and at least equal to the relevant deferred coupons.
In the event of any coupon deferral, the Company will not declare or pay any dividend on its ordinary or preference share capital.

Prior to 1 January 2004, certain significant business combinations were accounted for using the pooling of interests method or merger accounting, which treats the merged groups as if they had been combined throughout the current and comparative accounting periods.
Merger accounting principles for these combinations gave rise to a merger reserve in the consolidated statement of financial position, being the difference between the nominal value of new shares issued by the Parent Company for the acquisition of the shares of the subsidiary and the subsidiarys own share capital and share premium account.
The merger reserve is also used where more than 90% of the shares in a subsidiary are acquired and the consideration includes the issue of new shares by the Company, thereby attracting merger relief under the Companies Act 1985 and, from 1 October 2009, the Companies Act 2006.
The balance on the reserve of 3,271 million 2010: 3,271 million has arisen through the mergers of Commercial Union, General Accident and Norwich Union companies, forming Aviva plc in 2000, together with the acquisition of RAC plc RAC in 2005.
Because RAC ownership was immediately transferred from Aviva plc to a subsidiary company, this reserve is unaffected by the disposal of RAC in 2011.
35 Other reserves This note gives details of the various reserves forming part of the Groups consolidated equity and shows the movements during the year.

The Groups regulated subsidiaries are required to hold sufficient capital to meet acceptable solvency levels based on applicable local regulations.
Their ability to transfer retained earnings to the UK parent companies is therefore restricted to the extent these earnings form part of local regulatory capital.
37 Non-controlling interests This note gives details of the Groups non-controlling interests and shows the movements during the year.

This option was exercised on 17 January 2012, with completion expected later in 2012.

Any surplus or deficit emerging in NWPSF that is not distributed as bonus will be transferred from this sub-fund to the Reattributed Inherited Estate External Support Account RIEESA see below.
Old With-Profits sub-fund OWPSF, With-Profits sub-fund WPSF and Provident Mutual sub-fund PMSF of UKLAP, where the with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance.
Non-profit funds of Aviva Annuity UK and UKLAP, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by WPSF and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
The RIEESA of UKLAP, which is a non-profit fund where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits, but these cannot be distributed until the lock-in criteria set by the Reattribution Scheme have been met.
RIEESA will be used to write non-profit business and also to provide capital support to NWPSF.
In France, where the majority of policyholders benefits are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
In the US, there are two main types of business protection products and accumulation products.
Protection products include interest-sensitive whole life, term life, universal life and indexed life insurance policies.
The accumulation product segment includes traditional fixed and indexed deferred annuities for individuals and funding agreements for business customers.
In addition, there are two closed blocks of participating contracts arising from demutualisations of subsidiary companies.
All products are classified as insurance contracts except for the funding agreements and term certain immediate annuities, which are classified as non-participating investment contracts.
In other operations in Europe and Asia.
ii Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, modified where necessary to reflect the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where discretion is permitted.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Where discount rate assumptions are based on current market yields on fixed interest securities, allowance is made for default risk implicit in the yields on the underlying assets.
In Ireland, the allowance for Irish government bonds was made in proportion to the spread over the yields for equivalent AAA-rated government bonds.
In 2010, a test case was taken to the European Court of Justice to rule on the current law and practice whereby insurers may take into account a persons gender in the assessment of risk and consequently the pricing of insurance products.
The ruling was issued on 1 March 2011 and requires gender equality for pricing from 21 December 2012.
At 31 December 2011, the impact of the ruling on existing long-term business provisions in our UK and European businesses was not considered to be material 2010: not applicable.
Bonuses paid during the year are reflected in claims paid, whereas those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision.
iii Methodology and assumptions There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance is also made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 255 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Insurance liabilities continued a UK With-profit business The valuation of with-profit business uses the methodology developed for the Realistic Balance Sheet, adjusted to remove the shareholders share of future bonuses.
The key elements of the Realistic Balance Sheet methodology are the with-profit benefit reserve WPBR and the present value of the expected cost of any payments in excess of the WPBR referred to as the cost of future policyrelated liabilities.
The realistic liability for any contract is equal to the sum of the WPBR and the cost of future policy-related liabilities.
The WPBR for an individual contract is generally calculated on a retrospective basis, and represents the accumulation of the premiums paid on the contract, allowing for investment return, taxation, expenses and any other charges levied on the contract.
For a small proportion of business, a prospective valuation approach is used, including allowance for anticipated future regular and final bonuses.
The items included in the cost of future policy-related liabilities include: Maturity Guarantees: Guaranteed Annuity Options: GMP underpin on Section 32 transfers: and expected payments under Mortgage Endowment Promise.
In the Provident Mutual and With-Profits sub-funds in UKLAP, this is offset by the expected cost of charges to WPBR to be made in respect of guarantees.
The cost of future policy-related liabilities is determined using a market-consistent approach and, in the main, this is based on a stochastic model calibrated to market conditions at the end of the reporting period.
Non-market-related assumptions for example, persistency, mortality and expenses are based on experience, adjusted to take into account future trends.
The principal assumptions underlying the cost of future policy-related liabilities are as follows: Future investment return A risk-free rate equal to the spot yield on UK government securities, plus a margin of 0.1% is used.
The rates vary according to the outstanding term of the policy, with a typical rate as at 31 December 2011 of 2.20% 2010: 3.78% for a policy with ten years outstanding.
Volatility of investment return Volatility assumptions are set with reference to implied volatility data on traded market instruments, where available, or on a best estimate basis where not.
Volatility 2011 2010 Equity returns 26.4% 26.1% Property returns 15.0% 15.0% Fixed interest yields 18.0% 13.2% The equity volatility used depends on term, money-ness and region.
The figure shown is for a sample UK equity, at the money, with a ten-year term.
Fixed interest yield volatility is also dependent on term and money-ness.
The figure shown is for a ten-year swap option, currently at the money.
Future regular bonuses Annual bonus assumptions for 2012 have been set consistently with the year-end 2011 declaration.
Future annual bonus rates reflect the principles and practices of the fund.
In particular, the level is set with regard to the projected margin for final bonus and the change from one year to the next is limited to a level consistent with past practice.
Mortality Mortality assumptions for with-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.
The mortality tables used in the valuation are summarised below: Mortality table used 2011 2010 Assurances, pure endowments and deferred annuities before vesting Nil or Axx00 adjusted Nil or Axx00 adjusted Pensions business after vesting and pensions annuities in payment PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus PCMA00 PCFA00 adjusted plus allowance for future mortality allowance for future mortality improvement improvement 256 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Insurance liabilities continued Non-profit business Conventional non-profit contracts, including those written in the with-profit funds, are valued using gross premium methods which discount projected future cash flows.
The cash flows are calculated using the amount of contractual premiums payable, together with explicit assumptions for investment returns, inflation, discount rates, mortality, morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions vary by contract type and reflect current and expected future experience.
For unit-linked and some unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cash flows on the assumption that future premiums cease, unless it is more onerous to assume that they continue.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.
A further margin for risk is then deducted for all asset classes.
The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rates for business in the non-profit funds are as follows: Valuation discount rates 2011 2010 Assurances Life conventional non-profit 1.8% to 1.9% 2.8% Pensions conventional non-profit 2.6% 3.5% to 3.7% Annuities Conventional immediate and deferred annuities 2.2% to 4.3% 3.7% to 5.3% Non-unit reserves on Unit Linked business Life 1.8% to 2.2% 3.1% Pensions 2.2% to 2.7% 3.8% Income Protection Active lives 2.4% 3.5% Claims in payment level 3.6% 4.5% Claims in payment index linked 1.0 % 0.7 % Mortality assumptions for non-profit business are set with regard to recent Company experience and general industry trends.

The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
Valuation discount rates Mortality tables used 2011 and 2010 2011 and 2010 TD73-77, TD88-90, TH00-02, TF00-02, H AVDBS, F AVDBS, Life assurances 0% to 4.5% H SSDBS, F SSDBS.
Annuities 0% to 4.5% TGF05 TGH05 c United States For the major part of our US business, insurance liabilities are measured in accordance with US GAAP as at the date of acquisition.
The liability for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance is computed using the net level method, based on guaranteed interest and mortality rates as used in calculating cash surrender values.
The weighted average interest rate for all traditional life policy reserves in 2011 was 4.50% 2010: 4.50%.
Future policy benefit reserves for universal life insurance, deferred annuity products and funding agreements are computed under a retrospective deposit method and represent policy account balances before applicable surrender charges.
For the indexed products, the liability held is calculated based on the option budget method and is equal to the host contract and the calculated value of the derivative.
The value of the derivative is based on the present value of the difference between the projected fund value and the underlying fund guarantee.
The range of interest crediting rates for deferred annuity products, the largest component of the US business, excluding sales inducement payouts, was 1.00% to 5.20% in 2011 2010: 1.00% to 5.20%.
An additional liability is established for universal life contracts with death or other insurance benefit features, which is determined using an equally weighted range of scenarios with respect to investment returns, policyholder lapses, benefit election rates, premium payout patterns and mortality.
The additional liability represents the present value of future expected benefits based on current product assumptions.
The indexed life and annuity products guarantee the return of principal to the customer, and credit interest based on certain indices.
A portion of the premium from each customer is invested in fixed income securities and is intended to cover the minimum guaranteed value.
A further portion of the premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the customer as a direct result of increases in the related indices.
Both the derivatives and the options embedded in the policy are valued at their fair value.
Deferred income reserves are established for fees charged for insurance benefit features which are assessed in a manner that is expected to result in higher profits in earlier years, followed by lower profits or losses in subsequent years.
The excess charges are deferred and amortised using the same assumptions and factors used to amortise deferred acquisition costs.
Shadow adjustments may be made to deferred acquisition costs, acquired value of in-force business, deferred income reserves and contract liabilities.
The shadow adjustments are recognised directly in other comprehensive income so that unrealised gains or losses on investments that are recognised directly in other comprehensive income affect the measurement of the liability, or related assets, in the same way as realised gains or losses.
d Other countries In all other countries, local generally accepted interest rates and published standard mortality tables are used for different categories of business as appropriate.
The tables are based on relevant experience and show mortality rates, by age, for specific groupings of people.
258 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Insurance liabilities continued iv Movements The following movements have occurred in the long-term business provisions during the year: 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 160,946 154,058 Provisions in respect of new business 11,149 12,502 Expected change in existing business provisions 8,964 9,259 Variance between actual and expected experience 2,279 1,858 Impact of other operating assumption changes 61 520 Impact of economic assumption changes 5,663 1,959 Exceptional strengthening of longevity assumptions see below 483 Other movements 623 197 Change in liability recognised as an expense 4,885 6,826 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 6 1,117 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 32,159 Foreign exchange rate movements 227 1,055 Carrying amount at 31 December 133,893 160,946 The variance between actual and expected experience of 2.3 billion in 2011 was primarily due to the impact of falling equity markets on liabilities for unit-linked insurance contracts.
For many types of long-term business, including unit-linked and participating funds, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
Minor variances arise from differences between actual and expected experience for persistency, mortality and other demographic factors.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of insurance liabilities.
The 5.7 billion impact of economic assumption changes reflects reductions in valuation interest rates, primarily in respect of immediate annuity and participating insurance contracts in the UK.
For participating business, a movement in liabilities is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact on profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
c General insurance and health liabilities i Provisions for outstanding claims Delays occur in the notification and settlement of claims and a substantial measure of experience and judgement is involved in assessing outstanding liabilities, the ultimate cost of which cannot be known with certainty at the statement of financial position date.
The reserves for general insurance and health business are based on information currently available.
However, it is inherent in the nature of the business written that the ultimate liabilities may vary as a result of subsequent developments.
Provisions for outstanding claims are established to cover the outstanding expected ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses LAE in respect of all claims that have already occurred.
The provisions established cover reported claims and associated LAE, as well as claims incurred but not yet reported and associated LAE.
We only establish loss reserves for losses that have already occurred.
We therefore do not establish catastrophe equalisation reserves that defer a share of income in respect of certain lines of business from years in which a catastrophe does not occur to future periods in which catastrophes may occur.
When calculating reserves, we take into account estimated future recoveries from salvage and subrogation, and a separate asset is recorded for expected future recoveries from reinsurers after considering their collectability.
The table below shows the split of total general insurance and health outstanding claim provisions and IBNR provisions, gross of reinsurance, by major line of business.

The gross outstanding claims provision before discounting was 11,420 million 2010: 13,179 million.
The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims.
The discount rate that has been applied to latent claims reserves is based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency having regard to the expected settlement dates of the claims.
The range of discount rates used depends on the duration of the claims and is given in the table above.
The duration of the claims span over 35 years, with the average duration being between 7 and 16 years depending on the geographical region.
Any change in discount rates between the start and the end of the accounting period is reflected below operating profit as an economic assumption change.
During 2011, we have continued to experience a steady increase in the number of bodily injury claims settled by periodic payment orders PPOs or structured settlements, especially in the UK, which are reserved for on a discounted basis.
iii Assumptions Outstanding claims provisions are estimated based on known facts at the date of estimation.
Case estimates are set by skilled claims technicians and established case-setting procedures.
Claim technicians apply their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
They take into account all available information and correspondence regarding the circumstances of the claim, such as medical reports, investigations and inspections.
Claims technicians set case estimates according to documented claims department policies and specialise in setting estimates for certain lines of business or types of claim.
Claims above certain limits are referred to senior claims handlers for authorisation.
No adjustments are made to the claims technicians case estimates included in booked claim provisions, except for rare occasions when the estimated ultimate cost of individual large or unusual claim may be adjusted, subject to internal reserve committee approval, to allow for uncertainty regarding, for example, the outcome of a court case.
The ultimate cost of outstanding claims is then estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that a companys past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers based on the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
Historical claims development is mainly analysed by accident period, although underwriting or notification period is also used where this is considered appropriate.
Claim development is separately analysed for each geographic area, as well as by each line of business.
Certain lines of business are also further analysed by claim type or type of coverage.
In addition, large claims are usually separately addressed, either by being reserved at the face value of loss adjuster estimates or separately projected in order to reflect their future development.
The assumptions used in most non-life actuarial projection techniques, including future rates of claims inflation or loss ratio assumptions, are implicit in the historical claims development data on which the projections are based.
Additional qualitative judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in the future, for example, to reflect one-off occurrences, changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims inflation, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures in order to arrive at a point estimate for the ultimate cost of claims that represents the likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
The range of possible outcomes does not, however, result in the quantification of a reserve range.
As noted in section in section b ii above, an area of judgement is the impact of a European Court of Justice ruling in March 2011 on gender equality for the pricing of insurance products.
At 31 December 2011, the impact of the ruling on existing general business provisions was not considered to be material 2010: not applicable.
The following explicit assumptions are made which could materially impact the level of booked net reserves: UK mesothelioma claims The level of uncertainty associated with latent claims is considerable due to the relatively small number of claims and the long-tail nature of the liabilities.
UK mesothelioma claims account for a large proportion of the Groups latent claims.
The key assumptions underlying the estimation of these claims include claim numbers, the base average cost per claim, future inflation in the average cost of claims, legal fees and the life expectancy of potential sufferers.
The best estimate of the liabilities reflects the latest available market information and studies.
Many different scenarios can be derived by flexing these key assumptions and applying different combinations of the different assumptions.
An upper and lower scenario can be derived by making reasonably likely changes to these assumptions, resulting in an estimate 250 million greater than the best estimate, or 115 million lower than the best estimate.
These scenarios do not, however, constitute an upper or lower bound on these liabilities.
260 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Insurance liabilities continued Interest rates used to discount latent claim liabilities The discount rates used in determining our latent claim liabilities are based on the relevant swap curve in the relevant currency at the reporting date, having regard to the duration of the expected settlement of latent claims.
The range of discount rates used is shown in section ii above and depends on the duration of the claim and the reporting date.
At 31 December 2011, it is estimated that a 1% fall in the discount rates used would increase net claim reserves by approximately 85 million, excluding the offsetting effect on asset values as assets are not hypothecated across classes of business.
The impact of a 1% fall in interest rates across all assets and liabilities of our general insurance and health businesses is shown in note 56 h. Allowance for risk and uncertainty The uncertainties involved in estimating loss reserves are allowed for in the reserving process and by the estimation of explicit reserve uncertainty distributions.
The reserve estimation basis for non-life claims requires all non-life businesses to calculate booked claim provisions as the best estimate of the cost of future claim payments, plus an explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty.
The allowance for risk and uncertainty is calculated by each business unit in accordance with the requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy, taking into account the risks and uncertainties specific to each line of business and type of claim in that territory.
The requirements of the Group non-life reserving policy also seek to ensure that the allowance for risk and uncertainty is set consistently across both business units and reporting periods.
Changes to claims development patterns can materially impact the results of actuarial projection techniques.
However, allowance for the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions underlying reserving projections is automatically allowed for in the explicit allowance for risk and uncertainty included when setting booked reserves.
Lump sum payments in settlement of bodily injury claims decided by the UK courts are calculated in accordance with the Ogden Tables.
The Ogden Tables contain a discount rate that is set by the Lord Chancellor and that is applied when calculating the present value of loss of earnings for claims settlement purposes.
The Ogden discount rate is currently under review by the Lord Chancellor.
The timing of the conclusion of this review is unclear and it is still uncertain whether or by how much the rate will change.
However an allowance has been included in provisions for a reduction in the Ogden discount rates.
A reduction in the Ogden discount rates will increase lump sum payments to UK bodily injury claimants.
iv Movements The following changes have occurred in the general insurance and health claims provisions during the year: 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 12,263 12,696 Impact of changes in assumptions 149 26 Claim losses and expenses incurred in the current year 6,520 6,908 Decrease in estimated claim losses and expenses incurred in prior years 140 358 Exceptional strengthening of general insurance latent claims provisions 45 10 Incurred claims losses and expenses 6,574 6,586 Less: Payments made on claims incurred in the current year 3,393 3,641 Payments made on claims incurred in prior years 3,514 3,803 Recoveries on claim payments 313 271 Claims payments made in the year, net of recoveries 6,594 7,173 Unwind of discounting 47 64 Other movements in the claims provisions 12 18 Change in claims reserve recognised as an expense 15 541 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 4 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 1,445 Foreign exchange rate movements 87 102 Other movements 1 2 Carrying amount at 31 December 10,745 12,263 The effect of changes in the main assumptions is given in note 43 and the economic assumption changes are explained in note 9. d Loss development tables i Description of tables The tables that follow present the development of claim payments and the estimated ultimate cost of claims for the accident years 2002 to 2011.
The upper half of the tables shows the cumulative amounts paid during successive years related to each accident year.
For example, with respect to the accident year 2002, by the end of 2011 5,871 million had actually been paid in settlement of claims.
In addition, as reflected in the lower section of the table, the original estimated ultimate cost of claims of 6,250 million was reestimated to be 6,016 million at 31 December 2011.
The original estimates will be increased or decreased, as more information becomes known about the individual claims and overall claim frequency and severity.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 261 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 39 Insurance liabilities continued The Group aims to maintain strong reserves in respect of its general insurance and health business in order to protect against adverse future claims experience and development.
As claims develop and the ultimate cost of claims become more certain, the absence of adverse claims experience will result in a release of reserves from earlier accident years, as shown in the loss development tables and movements table c iv above.
However, in order to maintain overall reserve adequacy, the Group establishes strong reserves in respect of the current accident year 2011 where the development of claims is less mature and there is much greater uncertainty attaching to the ultimate cost of claims.
Releases from prior accident year reserves are also due to an improvement in the estimated cost of claims.
Key elements of the movement in prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2011 were: 78 million strengthening from the UK, including Group reinsurance business, mainly due to unfavourable development on commercial motor, commercial liability and December 2010 freeze claims.
42 million release from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal and commercial motor claims in Ireland and France.
92 million release from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor, following the legislative changes in Ontario, and commercial liability.
Key elements of the release from prior accident year general insurance and health net provisions during 2010 were: 101 million from the UK, including Group reinsurance business, mainly due to an improved view of Group reinsurance liabilities, and favourable development on personal property claims, and commercial property and commercial liability large claims.
167 million from Europe mainly due to favourable development of personal and commercial property.
44 million from Canada mainly due to favourable experience on motor and commercial liability.
The impact of using varying exchange rates is shown at the bottom of each table.
Disposals are dealt with by treating all outstanding and IBNR claims of the disposed entity as paid at the date of disposal.
The loss development tables above include information on asbestos and environmental pollution claims provisions from business written before 2002.
The undiscounted claim provisions for continuing operations, net of reinsurance, in respect of this business at 31 December 2011 were 929 million 2010: 896 million.
The movement in the year reflects exceptional strengthening of provisions by 35 million in the UK 2010: 10 million in respect of several specific discontinued commercial liability risks written in Canada a significant number of years ago, other strengthening of 23 million 2010: 68 million, claim payments, reinsurance recoveries and foreign exchange rate movements.

a Carrying amount The liability for investment contracts at 31 December comprised: 2011 2010 m m Long-term business Participating contracts 64,985 69,482 Non-participating contracts at fair value 43,990 46,124 Non-participating contracts at amortised cost 1,669 2,181 45,659 48,305 Total 110,644 117,787 b Long-term business investment liabilities Investment contracts are those that do not transfer significant insurance risk from the contract holder to the issuer, and are therefore treated as financial instruments under IFRS.
Many investment contracts contain a discretionary participation feature in which the contract holder has a contractual right to receive additional benefits as a supplement to guaranteed benefits.
These are referred to as participating contracts and are measured according to the methodology and Group practice for long-term business liabilities as described in note 39.
They are not measured at fair value as there is currently no agreed definition of fair valuation for discretionary participation features under IFRS.
In the absence of such a definition, it is not possible to provide a range of estimates within which a fair value is likely to fall.
The IASB has deferred consideration of participating contracts to Phase II of its insurance contracts project.
For participating business, the discretionary participation feature is recognised separately from the guaranteed element and is classified as a liability, referred to as unallocated distributable surplus.
Guarantees on long-term investment products are discussed in note 41.
Investment contracts that do not contain a discretionary participation feature are referred to as non-participating contracts and the liability is measured at either fair value or amortised cost.
Of the non-participating investment contracts measured at fair value, 42,434 million in 2011 are unit linked in structure and the fair value liability is equal to the unit reserve plus additional non-unit reserves if required on a fair value basis.
These contracts are classified as Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy, as the unit reserve is calculated as the publicly quoted unit price multiplied by the number units in issue, and any non-unit reserve is insignificant.
For unit-linked business, a deferred acquisition cost asset and deferred income reserve liability are recognised in respect of transaction costs and front-end fees respectively, that relate to the provision of investment management services, and which are amortised on a systematic basis over the contract term.
The amount of the related deferred acquisition cost asset is shown in note 27 and the deferred income liability is shown in note 50.
In the US, funding agreements consist of oneto ten-year fixed rate contracts.
These contracts may not be cancelled by the holders unless there is a default under the agreement, but may, subject to a call premium, be terminated by Aviva at any time.
Aviva issued no new funding agreements in 2011.
The weighted average interest rates for fixed-rate and floating-rate funding agreements as at 31 December 2011 were 4.766% and 0.503% respectively.
Funding agreements issued before 2008 are measured at fair value equal to the present value of contractual cash flows and, for business issued since 2008, are measured at amortised cost.
Most funding agreements are fully collateralised and therefore their fair values are not adjusted for own credit risk.
Funding agreements carried at fair value total 0.92 billion and are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
There is a small volume of annuity certain business for which the liability is measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
The fair value of contract liabilities measured at amortised cost is not materially different from the amortised cost liability.
264 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 40 Liability for investment contracts continued c Movements in the year The following movements have occurred in the year: i Participating investment contracts 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 69,482 66,559 Provisions in respect of new business 3,433 6,169 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,195 2,400 Variance between actual and expected experience 2,708 845 Impact of operating assumption changes 72 36 Impact of economic assumption changes 631 240 Other movements 211 65 Change in liability recognised as an expense 700 4,825 Foreign exchange rate movements 1,284 1,918 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 2,523 Other movements 10 16 Carrying amount at 31 December 64,985 69,482 The variance between actual and expected experience of 2.7 billion was primarily driven by unfavourable movements in investment markets in 2011, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values.
Equity markets fell and credit spreads on corporate bonds widened, reducing the value of assets supporting the participating investment liabilities.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of participating investment contract liabilities.
The impact of economic assumption changes of 0.6 billion relates mainly to the impact of lower risk-free interest rates on UK with-profits business.
ii Non-participating investment contracts 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 48,305 43,456 Provisions in respect of new business 3,863 4,096 Expected change in existing business provisions 2,558 2,145 Variance between actual and expected experience 2,796 1,276 Impact of operating assumption changes 1 20 Impact of economic assumption changes 7 3 Other movements 123 53 Change in liability 1,606 3,303 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 1,903 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 832 Foreign exchange rate movements 206 357 Other movements 2 Carrying amount at 31 December 45,659 48,305 The variance between actual and expected experience of 2.8 billion was primarily driven by unfavourable movements in investment markets in 2011, which had a direct or indirect impact on liability values.
Falling equity markets reduced the value of unit linked investment contracts, which comprise the vast majority of the non-participating investment contract liabilities.
For unit-linked investment contracts, movements in asset values are offset by corresponding changes in liabilities, limiting the net impact on profit.
The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of non-participating investment contract liabilities.
The impact of assumption changes on profit are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, which combines participating and non-participating investment contracts together with the impact of movements in related non-financial assets.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 265 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41 Financial guarantees and options This note details the financial guarantees and options we have given for some of our insurance and investment products.
As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including investment return guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Further information on assumptions is given in notes 39 and 40. a UK Life with-profit business In the UK, life insurers are required to comply with the FSAs realistic reporting regime for their with-profit funds for the calculation of FSA liabilities.
Under the FSAs rules, provision for guarantees and options within realistic liabilities must be measured at fair value, using market-consistent stochastic models.
A stochastic approach includes measuring the time value of guarantees and options, which represents the additional cost arising from uncertainty surrounding future economic conditions.
The material guarantees and options to which this provision relates are: i Maturity value guarantees Substantially all of the conventional with-profit business and a significant proportion of unitised with-profit business have minimum maturity values reflecting the sums assured plus declared annual bonus.
In addition, the guarantee fund has offered maturity value guarantees on certain unit-linked products.
For some unitised with-profit life contracts the amount paid after the fifth policy anniversary is guaranteed to be at least as high as the premium paid increased in line with the rise in RPI CPI.
ii No market valuation reduction MVR guarantees For unitised business, there are a number of circumstances where a no MVR guarantee is applied, for example on certain policy anniversaries, guaranteeing that no market value reduction will be applied to reflect the difference between the accumulated value of units and the market value of the underlying assets.
iii Guaranteed annuity options The Groups UK with-profit funds have written individual and group pension contracts which contain guaranteed annuity rate options GAOs, where the policyholder has the option to take the benefits from a policy in the form of an annuity based on guaranteed conversion rates.
The Group also has exposure to GAOs and similar options on deferred annuities.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the UK with-profit funds were 977 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 823 million.
With the exception of the New With-Profits sub fund NWPSF, movements in the realistic liabilities in the with-profit funds are offset by a corresponding movement in the unallocated divisible surplus, with no net impact on IFRS profit.
Realistic liabilities for GAOs in the NWPSF were 193 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 131 million.
iv Guaranteed minimum pension The Groups UK with-profit funds also have certain policies that contain a guaranteed minimum level of pensions as part of the condition of the original transfer from state benefits to the policy.
In addition, the with-profit fund companies have made promises to certain policyholders in relation to their with-profit mortgage endowments.
Top-up payments will be made on these policies at maturity to meet the mortgage value up to a maximum of the 31 December 1999 illustrated shortfall.
For UKLAP WP policyholders, these payments are subject to certain conditions.
b UK Life non-profit business The Groups UK non-profit funds are evaluated by reference to statutory reserving rules, including changes introduced in 2006 under FSA Policy Statement 06 14, Prudential Changes for Insurers.
i Guaranteed annuity options Similar options to those written in the with-profit fund have been written in relation to non-profit products.
Provision for these guarantees does not materially differ from a provision based on a market-consistent stochastic model, and amounts to 35 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 31 million.
ii Guaranteed unit price on certain products Certain unit-linked pension products linked to long-term life insurance funds provide policyholders with guaranteed benefits at retirement or death.
No additional provision is made for this guarantee as the investment management strategy for these funds is designed to ensure that the guarantee can be met from the fund, mitigating the impact of large falls in investment values and interest rates.
c Overseas life businesses In addition to guarantees written in the Groups UK life businesses, our overseas businesses have also written contracts containing guarantees and options.
Details of the significant guarantees and options provided by overseas life businesses are set out below.
266 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41 Financial guarantees and options continued i France Guaranteed surrender value and guaranteed minimum bonuses Aviva France has written a number of contracts with such guarantees.
The guaranteed surrender value is the accumulated value of the contract including accrued bonuses.
Bonuses are based on accounting income from amortised bond portfolios, where the duration of bond portfolios is set in relation to the expected duration of the policies, plus income and releases from realised gains on equity-type investments.
Policy reserves are equal to guaranteed surrender values.
Local statutory accounting envisages the establishment of a reserve, Provision pour Alas Financiers PAF, when accounting income is less than 125% of guaranteed minimum credited returns.
No PAF was established at the end of 2011.
The most significant of these contracts is the AFER Eurofund which has total liabilities of 33 billion at 31 December 2011 2010: 34 billion.
Up to 2010, the guaranteed bonus on this contract equalled 75% of the average of the last two years declared bonus rates.
Starting from year end 2010, Aviva France and the AFER association will agree the guaranteed bonus on this contract at every year end for the following year.
This bonus was 3.43% for 2011 2010: 3.55% compared with an accounting income from the fund of 3.92% 2010: 4.01%.
Non-AFER contracts with guaranteed surrender values had liabilities of 14 billion at 31 December 2011 2010: 13 billion and all guaranteed annual bonus rates are between 0% and 4.5%.
Guaranteed death and maturity benefits In France, the Group has also sold unit-linked policies where the death and or maturity benefit is guaranteed to be at least equal to the premiums paid.
The reserve held in the Groups consolidated statement of financial position at the end of 2011 for this guarantee is 130 million 2010: 85 million.
The reserve is calculated on a prudent basis and is in excess of the economic liability.
At the end of 2011, total sums at risk for these contracts were 631 million 2010: 242 million out of total unit-linked funds of 12 billion 2010: 14 billion.
The average age of policyholders was approximately 54.
It is estimated that this liability would increase by 96 million 2010: 93 million if yields were to decrease by 1% per annum and by 26 million 2010: 22 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from year end 2011 levels.
These figures do not reflect our ability to review the tariff for this option.
ii Ireland Guaranteed annuity options Products with similar GAOs to those offered in the UK have been issued in Ireland.
The current net of reinsurance provision for such options is 271 million 2010: 236 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis, making conservative assumptions for the factors which influence the cost of the guarantee, principally annuitant mortality option take-up and long-term interest rates.
These GAOs are in the money at current interest rates but the exposure to interest rates under these contracts has been hedged through the use of reinsurance, using derivatives swaptions.
The swaptions effectively guarantee that an interest rate of 5% will be available at the vesting date of these benefits so there is reduced exposure to a further decrease in interest rates.
No MVR guarantees Certain unitised with-profit policies containing no MVR guarantees, similar to those in the UK, have been sold in Ireland.
These guarantees are currently in-the-money by 6 million 2010: 13 million.
This has been calculated on a deterministic basis as the excess of the current policy surrender value over the discounted value excluding terminal bonus of the guarantees.
The value of these guarantees is usually sensitive to the performance of investments held in the with-profit fund.
Amounts payable under these guarantees are determined by the bonuses declared on these policies.
There is no sensitivity to either interest rates or equity markets since there is no longer any exposure to equity in these funds and a matching strategy has been implemented for bonds.
Return of premium guarantee Until 2005, Aviva Life and Pensions Ireland wrote two tranches of linked bonds with a return of premium guarantee, or a price floor guarantee, after five or six years.
The first tranche expired before the end of the previous financial reporting period.
The provision for the second tranche over and above unit and sterling reserves, at the end of 2011 is 7 million 2010: 9 million.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 2 million 2010: 3 million if equity markets were to decline by 10% from the year end 2011 levels.
However, the provision increase would be broadly off-set by an increase in the value of the hedging assets that were set up on sale of these policies.
We would not expect any significant impact on this provision as a result of interest rate movements.
It is estimated that the provision would increase by 0.8 million 2010: 0.5 million if property values were to decline by 10% from year end 2011 levels.
This would be offset by an increase in the value of the hedging assets by 0.8 million 2010: 0.5 million.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 267 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 41 Financial guarantees and options continued iii Spain and Italy Guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values The Group has also written contracts containing guaranteed investment returns and guaranteed surrender values in both Spain and Italy.
Traditional profit-sharing products receive an appropriate share of the investment return, assessed on a book value basis, subject to a guaranteed minimum annual return of up to 6% in Spain and 4% in Italy on existing business, while on new business the maximum guaranteed rate is lower.
Liabilities are generally taken as the face value of the contract plus, if required, an explicit provision for guarantees calculated in accordance with local regulations.
At 31 December 2011, total liabilities for the Spanish business were 3 billion 2010: 4 billion with a further reserve of 5 million 2010: 12 million for guarantees.
Total liabilities for the Italian business were 11 billion 2010: 11 billion, with a further provision of 43 million 2010: 46 million for guarantees.
Liabilities are most sensitive to changes in the level of interest rates.
It is estimated that provisions for guarantees would need to increase by 18 million 2010: 43 million in Spain and 5 million 2010: 7 million in Italy if interest rates fell by 1% from end 2011 values.
Under this sensitivity test, the guarantee provision in Spain is calculated conservatively, assuming a long-term market interest rate of 1.6% and no lapses or premium discontinuances.
iv United States Indexed and total return strategy products In the United States, the Group writes indexed life and deferred annuity products.
These products guarantee the return of principal to the policyholder and credit interest based on certain indices, primarily the Standard & Poors 500 Composite Stock Price Index.
A portion of each premium is used to purchase derivatives to hedge the growth in interest credited to the policyholder.
The derivatives held by the Group and the options embedded in the policy are both carried at fair value.
The US Treasury swap curve plus a risk adjustment of 2.48% 2010: 1.47% for indexed life and 2.51% 2010: 1.48% for indexed deferred annuities is used as the discount rate to calculate the fair value of the embedded options.
The risk adjustment calculation is based on market spreads on senior long-term unsecured Aviva plc debt with a reduction to reflect policyholder priority over other creditors in case of default.
The amount of change in the fair value of these embedded options resulting from the risk adjustment in 2011 is an increase of 453 million 2010: 216 million, and is principally attributable to market factors rather than instrument specific credit risk.
At 31 December 2011, the total liabilities for indexed products were 22 billion 2010: 20 billion, including liabilities for the embedded option of 2.6 billion 2010: 2.5 billion.
If interest rates were to increase by 1%, the provision for embedded options would decrease by 152 million 2010: 151 million and, if interest rates were to decrease by 1%, the provision would increase by 167 million 2010: 167 million.
The Group has certain products that credit interest based on a total return strategy, whereby policyholders are allowed to allocate their premium payments to different asset classes within the general account.
The Group guarantees a minimum return of premium plus approximately 3% interest over the term of the contracts.
The linked general account assets are fixed maturity securities, and both the securities and the contract liabilities are carried at fair value.
At 31 December 2011, the liabilities for total return strategy products were 0.9 billion 2010: 1.0 billion.
The Group offers an optional lifetime guaranteed income benefit focused on the retirement income segment of the deferred annuity marketplace to help customers manage income during both the accumulation stage and the distribution stage of their financial life.
At 31 December 2011, a total of 10.1 billion 2010: 8.9 billion in indexed deferred annuities have elected this benefit, taking steps to guarantee retirement income.
d Sensitivity In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, real estate prices and equity prices.
Interest rate guaranteed returns, such as those available on GAOs, are sensitive to interest rates falling below the guaranteed level.
Other guarantees, such as maturity value guarantees and guarantees in relation to minimum rates of return, are sensitive to fluctuations in the investment return below the level assumed when the guarantee was made.
268 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 42 Reinsurance assets This note details the reinsurance recoverables on our insurance and investment contract liabilities.
a Carrying amounts The reinsurance assets at 31 December comprised: 2011 2010 m m Long-term business Insurance contracts 3,747 3,650 Participating investment contracts 2 Non-participating investment contracts 1,626 1,463 Outstanding claims provisions 125 104 5,498 5,219 General insurance and health Outstanding claims provisions 974 1,113 Provisions for claims incurred but not reported 395 445 1,369 1,558 Provision for unearned premiums 245 307 1,614 1,865 Total 7,112 7,084 Of the above total, 5,086 million 2010: 4,675 million is expected to be recovered more than one year after the statement of financial position date.
b Assumptions The assumptions, including discount rates, used for reinsurance contracts follow those used for insurance contracts.
Reinsurance assets are valued net of an allowance for their recoverability.
c Movements The following movements have occurred in the reinsurance asset during the year: i In respect of long-term business provisions 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 5,115 5,557 Asset in respect of new business 187 358 Expected change in existing business asset 7 208 Variance between actual and expected experience 290 81 Impact of operating assumption changes 9 443 Impact of economic assumption changes 433 25 Other movements 260 318 Change in asset 648 555 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 2 174 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 375 Foreign exchange rate movements 13 61 Carrying amount at 31 December 5,373 5,115 The impact of assumption changes in the above analysis shows the resulting movement in the carrying value of reinsurance assets.
The increase in the reinsurance asset from economic assumption changes mainly relates to the impact of a reduction in valuation interest rate assumptions in the UK and Ireland, with a corresponding increase made to gross insurance contract liabilities.
For participating businesses, a movement in reinsurance assets is generally offset by a corresponding adjustment to the unallocated divisible surplus and does not impact on profit.
Where assumption changes do impact profit, these are included in the effect of changes in assumptions and estimates during the year shown in note 43, together with the impact of movements in related liabilities and other non-financial assets.

This note analyses the effect of the changes.
This disclosure only allows for the impact on liabilities and related assets, such as reinsurance, deferred acquisition costs and AVIF, and does not allow for offsetting movements in the value of backing financial assets.

This had the effect of increasing liabilities and hence a negative impact on profit.
The overall impact on profit also depends on movements in the value of assets backing the liabilities, which is not included in this disclosure.
44 Unallocated divisible surplus An unallocated divisible surplus UDS is established where the nature of policy benefits is such that the division between shareholder reserves and policyholder liabilities is uncertain.
This note shows the movements in this surplus during the year.
The following movements have occurred in the year: 2011 2010 m m Carrying amount at 1 January 3,428 3,866 Change in participating contract assets 3,016 444 Change in participating contract liabilities 244 169 Effect of special bonus to with-profit policyholders 58 Other movements 70 4 Change in liability recognised as an expense 2,702 329 Effect of portfolio transfers, acquisitions and disposals 3 Deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd 144 Foreign exchange rate movements 60 61 Other movements 8 45 Carrying amount at 31 December 650 3,428 In Italy, the UDS balance was 1,449 million negative at 31 December 2011 2010: 420 million negative.
In France and Spain, certain participating funds had negative UDS balances at 31 December 2011, although in aggregate the UDS balances for each of these business units was positive 2010: Spain 15 million negative.
Negative UDS balances result from an accounting mismatch between participating assets carried at market value and participating liabilities measured using local practice.
The negative balances were tested for recoverability using embedded value methodology and in line with local accounting practice.
The negative balances are considered to be recoverable from margins in the existing participating business liabilities.
Losses of 17 million in Italy and 49 million in Spain were incurred for negative UDS considered irrecoverable 2010: Italy 111 million, Spain 22 million.
In Italy the method for estimation of the recoverable negative UDS balance was changed in 2011, which is an alternative acceptable method under local accounting practice.
The estimation basis uses a real-world embedded value method.
In 2010 the recoverability test used a market-consistent embedded value method, with the reference rates based on the swap yield curve for a AA-rated bank with no liquidity premium.
Using a market-consistent embedded value method in 2011 with reference rates based on swaps with no liquidity premium would reduce the negative UDS balance to 61 million.
The IFRS profit before tax would reduce by 1,445 million and total comprehensive income would reduce by 425 million net of tax and non-controlling interests.
It is impracticable to determine the effect of the change in estimate for future periods.
Alternatively, using reference rates with allowance for a government spread premium based on the ECB AAA and Other curve would reduce the negative UDS balance to 715 million.
The IFRS profit before tax would reduce by 765 million and total comprehensive income would reduce by 225 million net of tax and non-controlling interests.
In Spain no change was made to the estimation basis that uses a market-consistent embedded value method.

In countries where there is a history of tax losses, deferred tax assets are only recognised in excess of deferred tax liabilities if there is convincing evidence that future profits will be available.
Where this is the case, the directors have relied on business plans supporting future profits.
The Group has unrecognised tax losses and other temporary differences of 910 million 2010: 2,150 million to carry forward against future taxable income of the necessary category in the companies concerned.
Of these, trading losses of 370 million will expire within the next 20 years.
The remaining losses have no expiry date.
In addition, the Group has unrecognised capital losses of 418 million 2010: 384 million.
These have no expiry date.
There are no temporary differences in respect of unremitted overseas retained earnings for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised at 31 December 2011 2010: nil.
Due to the availability of new information in the year, certain comparative amounts have been amended from amounts previously reported.

a Introduction The Group operates a large number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world.
The only material defined benefit schemes are in the UK, Canada and Ireland and, prior to its deconsolidation, the Netherlands.
Of these, the main UK scheme is by far the largest.
This note gives full IAS 19 disclosures for these schemes while the smaller ones, while still measured under IAS 19, are included as one total within Provisions see note 46.
Similarly, while the charges to the income statement for the main schemes are shown in section e iv below, the total charges for all pension schemes are disclosed in section d below.
The assets of the UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees.
In all schemes, the appointment of trustees of the funds is determined by their trust documentation, and they are required to act in the best interests of the schemes beneficiaries.
The long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
A full actuarial valuation of each of the defined benefit schemes is carried out at least every three years for the benefit of scheme trustees and members.
Actuarial reports have been submitted for each scheme within this period, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
b Membership The number of scheme members was as follows: United Kingdom Ireland Canada 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Number Number Number Number Number Number Active members 7,261 1,063 1,082 636 732 Deferred members 57,328 52,833 998 933 577 578 Pensioners 30,447 29,754 707 683 1,284 1,288 Total members 87,775 89,848 2,768 2,698 2,497 2,598 As noted below, the final salary sections of both UK schemes were closed to future accrual with effect from 1 April 2011. c UK schemes In the UK, the Group operates two main pension schemes, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme ASPS and the smaller RAC 2003 Pension Scheme, the obligation to which was retained after the sale of RAC Limited in September 2011.
New entrants join the defined contribution section of the ASPS, as the defined benefit section is closed.
This scheme is operated by a trustee company, with 11 trustee directors, comprising representatives of the employers, staff, pensioners and an independent trustee referred to below as the trustees.
On 20 October 2010, following formal consultation, the Group confirmed its decision to close the final salary sections of both UK schemes with effect from 1 April 2011, with entry into the defined contribution sections being offered to the staff members affected.
The consequential reduction in the liabilities of both schemes, arising from projecting forward salaries using estimates of inflation rather than salary inflation, together with additional contributions to affected members defined contribution accounts and implementation costs, resulted in an overall gain on closure of 286 million, which was accounted for in 2010.
Closure of the schemes has removed the volatility associated with adding future accrual for active members, and has also led to lower service costs and their cash funding since April 2011. i Defined benefit section of the ASPS The Company works closely with the trustees who are required to consult it on the funding of the scheme and its investment strategy.
Following each actuarial valuation, the Company and the trustees agree the level of contributions needed and funding levels are then monitored on an annual basis.
At 31 March 2009, the date of the last actuarial valuation, this section of the scheme had an excess of obligations over available assets, on a funding basis, which uses more prudent assumptions than are required for reporting under IAS 19, of 3.0 billion.
As a result of that valuation, the Company and the trustees have agreed a long-term funding plan where contributions, together with anticipated growth in scheme investments, are expected to eliminate the funding deficit over time.
Under this agreement, deficit funding payments of 378 million were made in 2010, and 178 million in 2011.
Further funding payments of 150 million are expected in 2012.
The funding payments, the reduction in scheme liabilities arising from scheme closures described above and the benefits arising from interest rate and inflation hedging activity have been partially offset by the impact of adverse market conditions, in particular significant falls in real gilt yields.
At 31 December 2011, the funding deficit is estimated to have fallen to 2.3 billion.
The employing companies contributions to the defined benefit section of the ASPS for the first three months of 2011 were 48% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year and the additional deficit funding described above, together totalling 239 million.
Active members of this section of the ASPS contributed between 5% and 7.5% of their pensionable salaries during the same period in 2011.
274 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47 Pension obligations continued ii Defined contribution money purchase section of the ASPS The trustees have responsibility for selecting a range of suitable funds in which the members can choose to invest and for monitoring the performance of the available investment funds.
Members are responsible for reviewing the level of contributions they pay and the choice of investment fund to ensure these are appropriate to their attitude to risk and their retirement plans.
Members of this section contribute at least 2% of their pensionable salaries and, depending on the percentage chosen, the Company contributes up to a maximum 14%, together with the cost of the death-in-service benefits.
These contribution rates are unchanged for 2012. d Credit charges to the income statement The total pension costs credit of all the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution schemes were: 2011 2010 m m Continuing operations UK defined benefit schemes 36 227 Overseas defined benefit schemes 22 8 58 219 Total defined benefit schemes note 10b UK defined contribution schemes 75 53 Overseas defined contribution schemes 20 17 Total defined contribution schemes note 10b 95 70 Total charge credit from continuing operations 153 149 Total charge from discontinued operations 7 44 Total charge credit for pension schemes 160 105 The credit for the defined benefit schemes in 2010 arose from the 286 million gain on the closure of the UK scheme to future accrual, described in section c above.
There were no significant contributions outstanding or prepaid as at either 31 December 2010 or 2011. e IAS 19 disclosures Disclosures under IAS 19 for the material defined benefit schemes in the UK, Ireland and Canada, and the Netherlands prior to the deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd, are given below.
Where schemes provide both defined benefit and defined contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to defined contribution pensions.
Total employer contributions for these schemes in 2012, including the ASPS deficit funding, are expected to be 250 million.
i Assumptions on scheme liabilities The projected unit credit method The inherent uncertainties affecting the measurement of scheme liabilities require these to be measured on an actuarial basis.
This involves discounting the best estimate of future cash flows to be paid out by the scheme using the projected unit credit method.
This is an accrued benefits valuation method which calculates the past service liability to members and makes allowance for their projected future earnings.
It is based on a number of actuarial assumptions, which vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which the relevant businesses are situated, and changes in these assumptions can materially affect the measurement of the pension obligations.
Alternative measurement methods There are alternative methods of measuring liabilities, for example by calculating an accumulated benefit obligation the present value of benefits for service already rendered but with no allowance for future salary increases or on a solvency basis, using the cost of securing the benefits at a particular date with an insurance company or one of the growing market of alternative buy-out providers.
This could take the form of a buy-out, in which the entire liability will be settled in one payment with all obligations transferred to an insurance company or buy-out provider, or a buy-in, in which annuities or other insurance products are purchased to cover a part or all of the liability.
A valuation of the liabilities in either of these cases will almost always result in a higher estimate of the pension deficit than under an ongoing approach, as they assume that the sponsor immediately transfers the majority, if not all, of the risk to another provider who would be seeking to make a profit on the transaction.
However, there are only a limited number of organisations that would be able to offer these options for schemes of the size of those in our Group.
The full buy-out cost would only be known if quotes were obtained from such organisations but, to illustrate the cost of a buy-out valuation, an estimate for the main UK scheme is that the year-end liabilities of 8.4 billion could be valued some 5.4 billion higher, at 13.8 billion.
There is a small buy-out market in Ireland, largely restricted to pensions currently in payment and it is not clear whether current capacity would enable an immediate buy-out of our Irish pension liabilities at present.
The Canadian defined benefit plans liabilities represent the likely limit on what the Canadian group annuity market could absorb at normal competitive group annuity prices if the entire plan were subject to a buy-out valuation.
There is in fact a reasonably high chance that only a portion of the plans liabilities could be absorbed in one tranche.
IAS 19 requires us to use the projected unit credit method to measure our pension scheme liabilities.
Neither of the alternative methods is considered appropriate in presenting fairly the Groups obligations to the members of its pension schemes on an ongoing basis, so they are not considered further.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 275 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47 Pension obligations continued Valuations and assumptions The valuations used for accounting under IAS 19 have been based on the most recent full actuarial valuations, updated to take account of that standards requirements in order to assess the liabilities of the material schemes at 31 December 2011.
Scheme assets are stated at their fair values at 31 December 2011.
The main actuarial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under IAS 19 are: UK Ireland 2011 2010 2011 2010 Inflation rate 3.1% 3.5% 2.0% 2.0% General salary increases 4.9% 5.3% 3.5% 3.5% Pension increases 3.1% 3.5% 2.0% 2.0% Deferred pension increases 3.1% 3.5% 2.0% 2.0% Discount rate 4.9% 5.5% 5.7% 5.6% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds Canada Netherlands 2011 2010 2011 2010 Inflation rate 2.5% 2.5% n a 1.9% General salary increases 3.75% 3.75% n a 2.9% Pension increases 1.25% 1.25% n a 1.9% Deferred pension increases n a 1.9% Discount rate 4.5% 5.0% n a 5.1% Basis of discount rate AA-rated corporate bonds AA-rated corporate bonds Age-related scale increases plus 2.9%.
2.1% until 2011 and expected return less 3% thereafter.
The discount rate and pension increase rate are the two assumptions that have the largest impact on the value of the liabilities, with the difference between them being known as the net discount rate.
For each country, the discount rate is based on current average yields of high-quality debt instruments taking account of the maturities of the defined benefit obligations.
A 1% increase in this rate and therefore the net discount rate would reduce the liabilities by 1.7 billion and the service cost for the year by 9 million.
It would also reduce the interest cost on those liabilities by 1 million.
Mortality assumptions Mortality assumptions are significant in measuring the Groups obligations under its defined benefit schemes, particularly given the maturity of these obligations in the material schemes.
The assumptions used are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of these schemes.
The mortality tables, average life expectancy and pension duration used at 31 December 2011 for scheme members are as follows: Life expectancy pension Life expectancy pension duration at NRA of a male duration at NRA of a female Normal 20 years 20 years retirement Currently younger Currently younger Mortality table age NRA aged NRA than NRA aged NRA than NRA UK ASPS Club Vita pooled experience, including an allowance for future improvements 60 89.9 93.2 89.9 92.1 29.9 33.2 29.9 32.1 RAC SAPS series 1, including allowances for future improvement 65 87.7 90.7 89.8 91.8 22.7 25.7 24.8 26.8 Ireland 94% PNA00 with allowance for future improvements 61 86.5 89.5 89.3 92.3 25.5 28.5 28.3 31.3 Canada UP1994, with Projection Scale AA applied on a generational basis 65 84.6 86.1 87.0 87.9 19.6 21.1 22.0 22.9 The assumptions above are based on commonly used mortality tables and, in the UK, have been changed to those used by both schemes trustees in the most recent full actuarial valuations.
The new tables make allowance for observed variations in such factors as age, gender, pension amount, salary and postcode-based lifestyle group, and have been adjusted to reflect recent research into mortality experience.
However, the extent of future improvements in longevity is subject to considerable uncertainty and judgement is required in setting this assumption.
In the UK schemes, which are the most material to the Group, the assumptions include an allowance for future mortality improvement, based on the actuarial professions long and medium cohort projection tables for the ASPS and RAC schemes respectively and incorporating underpins to the rate of future improvement equal to 1.5% per annum for males and 1.0% per annum for females.
The effect of assuming all members were one year younger would increase the liabilities in all the schemes by 265 million and the service cost for the year by 1 million.
The discounted scheme liabilities have an average duration of 20 years in the main UK scheme, 22 years in the RAC scheme, 19 years in the Irish scheme and 13 years in the Canadian scheme.
The undiscounted benefits payable from the main UK defined benefit scheme are expected to be as shown in the chart below: 276 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47 Pension obligations continued Undiscounted benefit payments m Deferred member cash ows Pensioner cash ows 700 600 500 400 300 200 100 0 2012 2042 2072 2102 ii Assumptions on scheme assets The expected rates of return on the schemes assets are: UK Ireland Canada Netherlands 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 2012 2011 Equities 5.8% 7.2% 5.9% 6.9% 5.8% 7.0% n a 6.2% Bonds 3.4% 4.4% 3.2% 2.7% 3.2% 3.2% n a 3.6% Property 4.3% 5.7% 4.4% 5.4% n a n a n a 2.9% Cash 0.7% 0.6% 0.9% 2.7% 0.8% 1.0% n a n a The overall rates of return are based on the expected returns within each asset category and on current asset allocations.
The expected returns for equities and properties are aligned with the rates used for the longer-term investment return assumptions, other than in the Netherlands, where the 2011 figures were developed in conjunction with external advisers due to the characteristics of the scheme.
The figures for the total expected return on scheme assets in the following section are stated after deducting investment expenses and, in Ireland, the government levy on pension fund assets.
iii Investments in Group-managed funds and insurance policies Plan assets include investments in Group-managed funds in the consolidated statement of financial position of 112 million 2010: 116 million and insurance policies with other Group companies of 163 million 2010: 160 million in the main UK scheme.
Prior to the deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd, the assets of the Dutch scheme mainly consisted of insurance policies with that company, totalling 1,445 million at 31 December 2010.
The Dutch insurance policies were considered non-transferable under the terms of IAS 19 and so, in the 2010 comparatives, were treated as other obligations to staff pension schemes within provisions see note 46.
The treatment in the relevant parts of the financial statements is as follows: Plan assets the treatment of these funds and policies in the consolidated statement of financial position is described above.
Expected rates of return where the relevant insurance policies are in segregated funds with specific asset allocations, their expected rates of return are included in the appropriate line in the table in section ii above.

vi Risk management and asset allocation strategy As noted above, the long-term investment objectives of the trustees and the employers are to limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term, and to maximise returns consistent with an acceptable level of risk so as to control the long-term costs of these schemes.
To meet these objectives, each schemes assets are invested in a diversified portfolio, consisting primarily of equity and debt securities.
These reflect the current long-term asset allocation ranges chosen, having regard to the structure of liabilities within the schemes.
Main UK scheme Both the Group and the trustees regularly review the asset liability management of the main UK scheme.
It is fully understood that, while the current asset mix is designed to produce appropriate long-term returns, this introduces a material risk of volatility in the schemes surplus or deficit of assets compared with its liabilities.
The principal asset risks to which the scheme is exposed are: Equity market risk the effect of equity market falls on the value of plan assets.
Inflation risk the effect of inflation rising faster than expected on the value of the plan liabilities.
Interest rate risk falling interest rates leading to an increase in liabilities significantly exceeding the increase in the value of assets.
There is also an exposure to currency risk where assets are not denominated in the same currency as the liabilities.
The majority of this exposure has been removed by the use of hedging instruments.
In 2011, there has been a further reduction in the proportion of assets invested in equities, thereby mitigating the equity risk above.
In addition, the trustees have taken further measures to partially mitigate inflation and interest rate risks.
Other schemes The other schemes are considerably less material but their risks are managed in a similar way to those in the main UK scheme.

As described in note 57 a, the Group has designated a portion of its euro and US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European and American subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt, included in the table above, at 31 December 2011 was 1,815 million 2010: 2,791 million.
ii The contractual maturity dates of undiscounted cash flows for these borrowings are: 2011 2010 Principal Interest Total Principal Interest Total m m m m m m Within 1 year 506 312 818 655 512 1,167 1 to 5 years 200 1,237 1,437 1,783 1,783 5 to 10 years 435 1,395 1,830 1,128 2,090 3,218 10 to 15 years 510 1,236 1,746 1,243 1,788 3,031 Over 15 years 3,643 2,859 6,502 3,382 6,244 9,626 Total contractual undiscounted cash flows 5,294 7,039 12,333 6,408 12,417 18,825 282 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 48 Borrowings continued Borrowings are considered current if the contractual maturity dates are within a year.
Where subordinated debt is undated or loan notes are perpetual, the interest payments have not been included beyond 15 years.
Annual interest payments for these borrowings are 73 million 2010: 84 million.
Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable.
Year-end exchange rates have been used for interest projections on loans in foreign currencies.
c Operational borrowings i The carrying amounts of these borrowings are: 2011 2010 m m Amounts owed to financial institutions Loans 1,889 2,550 Securitised mortgage loan notes UK lifetime mortgage business 1,306 1,288 Dutch domestic mortgage business 5,045 1,306 6,333 Total 3,195 8,883 All the above borrowings are stated at amortised cost, except for the loan notes issued in connection with the UK lifetime mortgage business of 1,306 million 2010: 1,288 million and nil 2010: 3,402 million of the loan notes issued in connection with the Dutch domestic mortgage business, which were carried at fair value prior to the deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd.
For the UK loan notes carried at fair value, their values are modelled on risk-adjusted cash flows for defaults discounted at a risk-free rate plus a marketdetermined liquidity premium, and are therefore classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
These have been designated at fair value through profit and loss in order to present the relevant mortgages, borrowings and derivative financial instruments at fair value, since they are managed as a portfolio on a fair value basis.
This presentation provides more relevant information and eliminates any accounting mismatch.
The securitised mortgage loan notes are at various fixed, floating and index-linked rates.
Further details about these notes are given in note 24. ii The contractual maturity dates of undiscounted cash flows for these borrowings are: 2011 2010 Principal Interest Total Principal Interest Total m m m m m m Less than 1 year 677 39 716 1,560 220 1,780 1 to 5 years 995 124 1,119 1,157 899 2,056 5 to 10 years 247 82 329 266 1,084 1,350 10 to 15 years 510 64 574 317 956 1,273 Over 15 years 1,008 439 1,447 5,198 4,077 9,275 3,437 748 4,185 8,498 7,236 15,734 Contractual undiscounted interest payments are calculated based on underlying fixed interest rates or prevailing market floating rates as applicable.

The dated subordinated notes rank ahead of the undated subordinated notes.
The fair value of these notes at 31 December 2011 was 3,814 million 2010: 4,370 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
ii Debenture loans The 9.5% guaranteed bonds were issued by the Company at a discount of 1.1 million.
This discount and the issue expenses are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary.
Other loans totalling nil 2010: 12 million related to borrowings in the US which were fully repaid during the year.
All these borrowings are at fixed rates and their fair value at 31 December 2011 was 246 million 2010: 860 million, calculated with reference to quoted prices.
iii Commercial paper The commercial paper consists of 506 million issued by the Company 2010: 504 million and is considered core structural funding.
All commercial paper is repayable within one year and is issued in a number of different currencies, primarily sterling, euros and US dollars.
Its fair value is considered to be the same as its carrying value.

a Uncertainty over claims provisions Note 39 gives details of the estimation techniques used by the Group to determine the general business outstanding claims provisions and of the methodology and assumptions used in determining the long-term business provisions.
These approaches are designed to allow for the appropriate cost of policy-related liabilities, with a degree of prudence, to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed, or future general business claims inflation differs from that expected, there is uncertainty in respect of these liabilities.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation arising there from, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Among these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including Europe, Canada and Australia.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notification of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, on the basis of current information having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any additional costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees and options, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
Note 41 gives details of these guarantees and options.
In providing these guarantees and options, the Groups capital position is sensitive to fluctuations in financial variables including foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, property values and equity prices.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions for such guarantees and options are sufficient.
d Regulatory compliance The Groups insurance and investment business is subject to local regulation in each of the countries in which it operates.
The FSA regulates the Groups UK business and monitors the financial resources and organisation of the Group as a whole.
The FSA has broad powers including the authority to grant, vary the terms of, or cancel a regulated firms authorisation: to investigate marketing and sales practices: and to require the maintenance of adequate financial resources.
The Groups regulators outside the UK typically have similar powers, but in some cases they operate a system of prior product approval and hence place less emphasis than the FSA on regulating sales and marketing practices.
The Groups regulated businesses have compliance resources to respond to regulatory enquiries in a constructive way, and take corrective action when warranted.
However, all regulated financial services companies face the risk that their regulator could find that they have failed to comply with applicable regulations or have not undertaken corrective action as required.
The impact of any such finding whether in the UK or overseas could have a negative impact on the Groups reported results or on its relations with current and potential customers.
Regulatory action against a member of the Group could result in adverse publicity for, or negative perceptions regarding, the Group, or could have a material adverse effect on the business of the Group, its results of operations and or financial condition and divert managements attention from the day-to-day management of the business.
e Payment protection insurance PPI mis-selling In September 2009, the FSA launched an investigation into sales practices for payment protection insurance PPI.
On 10 August 2010, the FSA announced that mis-selling of PPI policies had been widespread and that consumers who could prove mis-selling would be entitled to financial redress from distributors of the policies.
The directors do not consider that the Group is liable for mis-selling in its role as underwriter and so no provision is currently necessary.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 287 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 51 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued f Structured settlements In Canada, annuities have been purchased from licensed Canadian life insurers to provide for fixed and recurring payments to claimants.
As a result of these arrangements, the Group is exposed to credit risk to the extent that any of the life insurers fail to fulfil their obligations.
The Groups maximum exposure to credit risk for these arrangements is approximately 686 million as at 31 December 2011 2010: 683 million based on estimated replacement cost for the underlying annuities.
The credit risk is managed by acquiring annuities from a diverse portfolio of life insurers with proven financial stability.
The risk is reduced to the extent of coverage provided by Assuris, the Canadian life insurance industry compensation plan.
No information has come to the Groups attention that would suggest any weakness or failure in the Canadian life insurers from which it has purchased annuities.
g Other In the course of conducting insurance and investment business, various Group companies receive liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened related litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate provisions have been established for such claims and no material loss will arise in this respect.
The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain other Group companies.
At 31 December 2011, the total exposure of the Group and Company is nil 2010: nil and 334 million 2010: 343 million respectively and, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiaries and associates to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
The Groups insurance subsidiaries pay contributions to levy schemes in several countries in which we operate.
Given the economic environment, there is a heightened risk that the levy contributions will need to be increased to protect policyholders if an insurance company falls into financial difficulties.
The directors continue to monitor the situation but are not aware of any need to increase provisions at the statement of financial position date.
52 Commitments This note gives details of our commitments to capital expenditure and under operating leases.

Around two thirds of the Groups balances relate to unit-linked or participating policyholder funds.
As such, the asset mix and the level of cash held by these funds are determined from a policyholder perspective and can move significantly from one year to another.
Shareholder cash has remained broadly unchanged at 8.6 billion 2010: 8.5 billion.
Purchases and sales of operating assets, including financial investments, are included within operating cash flows as the purchases are funded from cash flows associated with the origination of insurance and investment contracts, net of payments of related benefits and claims.
During the year, the net operating cash inflow reflects a number of factors, including changes in the investment strategy of funds to hold a lower weighting of cash and higher levels of financial investments, the level of premium income and the timing of receipts of premiums and the payment of creditors, claims and surrenders.
It also includes changes in the size and value of consolidated cash investment funds and changes in the Group participation in these funds.

These internal lending arrangements, which net out on consolidation, arise in relation to the following: Aviva Insurance Limited AI acts as both a UK general insurer and as the primary holding company for our foreign subsidiaries.
Internal capital management mechanisms in place allocate a portion of the total capital of the company to the UK general insurance operations, giving rise to notional lending between the general insurance and holding company activities.
These mechanisms also allow for some of the assets of the general insurance business to be made available for use across the Group.
Certain subsidiaries, subject to continuing to satisfy standalone capital and liquidity requirements, loan funds to corporate and holding entities.
These loans satisfy arms length criteria and all interest payments are made when due.
290 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 54 Group capital structure continued Total capital employed is financed by a combination of equity shareholders funds, preference capital, subordinated debt and borrowings.
At 31 December 2011, we had 20.8 billion 2010: 26.3 billion of total capital employed in our trading operations, measured on an MCEV basis.
The reduction is primarily driven by the deconsolidation of Delta Lloyd and the impact of financial markets.
In May 2011 we issued 450 million of Lower Tier 2 hybrid capital securities maturing in 2041 which may be called from 2021.
In November 2011 we issued a further US$400 million of Lower Tier 2 hybrid capital securities maturing in 2041 which may be called from 2016.
These instruments are expected to comply for Tier 2 treatment under Solvency 2.
The transactions had a positive impact on Group IGD solvency and Economic Capital measures.
Also in November 2011 800 million of Lower Tier 2 hybrid capital securities were redeemed at first call.
Financial leverage, the ratio of external senior and subordinated debt to MCEV capital and reserves, was 36.7% 2010: 31.9%.
Fixed charge cover, which measures the extent to which external interest costs, including subordinated debt interest and preference dividends, are covered by MCEV operating profit, was 8.9 times 2010: 9.4 times.
At 31 December 2011, the market value of our external debt, subordinated debt, preference shares including both Aviva plc preference shares of 200 million and General Accident plc preference shares, within non-controlling interests, of 250 million, and direct capital instrument was 5,782 million 2010: 7,279 million, with a weighted average cost, post tax, of 6.6% 2010: 4.5%.
The Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC is 7.1% 2010: 7.8% and has been calculated by reference to the cost of equity and the cost of debt at the relevant date.

Further analysis of the movement in the liabilities of the long-term business can be found in notes 39 and 40.
The analysis of movements in capital provides an explanation of the movement in available capital of the Groups life business for the year.
This analysis is intended to give an understanding of the underlying causes of changes in the available capital of the Groups life business, and provides a distinction between some of the key factors affecting the available capital.
The negative shareholders funds balance within the UK with-profit funds arises in NWPSF as a result of regulatory valuation and admissibility differences in the reattributed estate which is valued on a realistic regulatory basis compared to the disclosure on an IFRS basis.
NWPSF is fully supported by the reattributed estate of 1,113 million this is known as RIEESA, at 31 December 2011 31 December 2010: 1,218 million, held within NPSF1 a non-profit fund within UKLAP included within other UK life operations, in the form of a capital support arrangement.
This support arrangement will provide capital to NWPSF to ensure that the value of assets of NWPSF are at least equal to the value of liabilities calculated on a realistic regulatory basis therefore it forms part of the NWPSF available capital resources.
The WPSF RIEESA uses internal hedging to limit the impacts of equity market performance.
These funds are still exposed to equity volatility which has increased significantly during the year, reducing available capital resources.
In aggregate, the Group has at its disposal total available capital of 12.3 billion 2010: 16.6 billion, representing the aggregation of the solvency capital of all of our businesses.
This capital is available to meet risks and regulatory requirements set by reference to local guidance and EU directives.
After effecting the year-end transfers to shareholders, the UK with-profit funds have available capital of 3.0 billion 2010: 3.4 billion including amounts held in RIEESA.
Subject to certain conditions, the RIEESA capital can be used to write new non-profit business, but the primary purpose of this capital is to provide support for the UK with-profit business.
The capital is comfortably in excess of the required capital margin, and therefore the shareholders are not required to provide further support.
For the remaining life and general insurance operations, the total available capital amounting to 9.3 billion 2010: 13.2 billion is significantly higher than the minimum requirements established by regulators and, in principle, the excess is available to shareholders.
In practice, management will hold higher levels of capital within each business operation to provide appropriate cover for risk.
As the total available capital of 12.3 billion is arrived at on the basis of local regulatory guidance, which evaluates assets and liabilities prudently, it understates the economic capital of the business which is considerably higher.
This is a limitation of the Group Capital Statement which, to be more meaningful, needs to evaluate available capital on an economic basis and compare it with the risk capital required for each individual operation, after allowing for the considerable diversification benefits that exist in our Group.
Within the Aviva Group there exist intra-group arrangements to provide capital to particular business units.
Included in these arrangements is a subordinated loan of 200 million from Aviva Life Holdings UK Limited to Aviva Annuity Limited to provide capital to support the writing of new business.
The available capital of the Groups with-profit funds is determined in accordance with the Realistic balance sheet regime prescribed by the FSAs regulations, under which liabilities to policyholders include both declared bonuses and the constructive obligation for future bonuses not yet declared.
The available capital resources include an estimate of the value of their respective estates, included as part of the unallocated divisible surplus.
The estate represents the surplus in the fund that is in excess of any constructive obligation to policyholders.
It represents capital resources of the individual with-profit fund to which it relates and is available to meet regulatory and other solvency requirements of the fund and, in certain circumstances, additional liabilities may arise.
The liabilities included in the balance sheet for the with-profit funds do not include the amount representing the shareholders portion of future bonuses.
However, the shareholders portion is treated as a deduction from capital that is available to meet regulatory requirements and is therefore shown as a separate adjustment in the capital statement.
In accordance with the FSAs regulatory rules under its realistic capital regime, the Group is required to hold sufficient capital in its UK life with-profit funds to meet the FSA capital requirements, based on the risk capital margin RCM.
The determination of the RCM depends on various actuarial and other assumptions about potential changes in market prices, and the actions management would take in the event of particular adverse changes in market conditions.

Under the FSA regulatory regime, UK life with-profits business is required to hold capital equivalent to the greater of their regulatory requirement based on EU directives regulatory peak and the FSA realistic bases realistic peak described above.
For UK non-participating business, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with FSA regulations.
The available capital reflects the excess of regulatory basis assets over liabilities before deduction of capital resources requirement.
For UK general insurance businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the FSA requirements.
For overseas businesses in the European Economic Area EEA, US, Canada, Hong Kong and Singapore, the available capital and the minimum requirement are calculated under the locally applicable regulatory regimes.
The businesses outside these territories are subject to the FSA rules for the purposes of calculation of available capital and capital resource requirement.
For fund management and other businesses, the relevant capital requirement is the minimum solvency requirement determined in accordance with the local regulators requirements for the specific class of business.
The available capital resources in each regulated entity are generally subject to restrictions as to their availability to meet requirements that may arise elsewhere in the Group.
The principal restrictions are: UK with-profit funds NWPSF, OWPSF and WPSF any available surplus held in each fund can be used to meet the requirements of the fund itself, be distributed to policyholders and shareholders or in the case of NWPSF and OWPSF, transferred via the capital support arrangement explained above for OWPSF only to the extent support has been provided in the past.
In most cases, with-profit policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits while the shareholders receive the balance.
The latter distribution would be subject to a tax charge, which is met by the fund.
UK non-participating funds any available surplus held in these is attributable to shareholders.
Capital in the non-profit funds may be made available to meet requirements elsewhere in the Group subject to meeting the regulatory requirements of the fund.
Any transfer of the surplus may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
Overseas life operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
The available capital resources in all these businesses are subject to local regulatory restrictions which may constrain managements ability to utilise these in other parts of the Group.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
General insurance operations the capital requirements and corresponding regulatory capital held by overseas businesses are calculated using the locally applicable regulatory regime.
Any transfer of available capital may give rise to a tax charge, subject to availability of tax relief elsewhere in the Group.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 293 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management This note sets out the major risks our businesses face and describes the Groups approach to managing these.
It also gives sensitivity analyses around the major economic and non-economic assumptions that can cause volatility in the Groups earnings and capital requirements.
a Risk management framework The risk management framework RMF in Aviva forms an integral part of the management and Board processes and decision-making framework across the Group.
The key elements of our risk management framework comprise risk appetite, risk modelling, roles and responsibilities, risk policies and procedures and risk governance and oversight.
Additional information on the key elements of the RMF is included in the risk and capital management section of the performance review.
The Groups approach to risk management ensures that significant existing or emerging risks are actively identified, measured, managed, monitored and reported on a continuous basis.
For the purposes of risk identification and measurement, risks are usually grouped by risk type: credit, market, liquidity, general insurance, life insurance and operational risk.
Risk falling within these types may affect a number of key metrics including those relating to balance sheet strength, liquidity and profit.
They may also affect the performance of the products that we deliver to our customers and the service to our customers and distributors, which can be categorised as risks to our brand and reputation.
Additional information on the groups risks is included in the risk section of the Performance review.
To promote a consistent and rigorous approach to risk management across all our businesses and locations in which we operate, we have a set of formal risk policies and business standards.
These risk policies and business standards set out our appetite for different risk types and provide risk management and control requirements for the Groups worldwide operations.
A regular top-down key risk identification and assessment process is carried out in the risk function at group level based on group and regional chief risk officer and functional risk director input.
This includes the consideration of emerging risks and is supported by deeper thematic reviews and is replicated at regional and business unit level.
The risk assessment processes are used to generate risk reports which are shared with the relevant risk committees.
Risk models are an important tool in our measurement of risk and are used to support the monitoring and reporting of the risk profile and in the consideration of the risk management actions available.
We carry out a range of stress where one risk factor, such as equity returns, is assumed to vary and scenario where combinations of risk factors are assumed to vary tests to evaluate their impact on the business and the management actions available to respond to the conditions envisaged.
Board oversight of risk and risk management across the Group is maintained on a regular basis through its Risk Committee.
The Board has overall responsibility for determining risk appetite, which is an expression of the risk it is willing to take.
The Groups position against risk appetite is monitored and reported to the Board on a regular basis.
The risk governance framework allocates responsibility for the oversight of risk management to a number of committees at group centre, with the Asset Liability Committee ALCO providing a key focus on business and financial risks and the Operational Risk Committee ORC providing a key focus on operational risks.
The group-level committees are in turn supported by similar governance structures in the regions.
Risk management in relation to Delta Lloyd During 2011 Aviva has completed a partial disposal of its equity holding in Delta Lloyd.
At 31 December 2010 Aviva held a controlling interest of 58% in Delta Lloyds issued equity, and as a result and in accordance with IFRS, consolidated 100% of Delta Lloyd assets and liabilities.
As a result of the partial disposal of Delta Lloyd on 6 May 2011 Avivas share of Delta Lloyds voting rights has fallen below 50% and so Delta Lloyd has been deconsolidated.
Aviva has retained a 42% associate interest.
Aviva continues to actively monitor the quality of Delta Lloyds balance sheet and risk profile through: membership of the Supervisory Board with access to Board papers and its committees: Delta Lloyds submission of financial data to meet the group external reporting requirements: Delta Lloyds submission of information to meet the groups regulatory commitments: and reviewing of the quarterly risk profile ORSA report as approved by the Delta Lloyd Executive Board.
To enable Aviva to satisfy its ongoing financial reporting, audit and other legal and regulatory requirements, including Avivas risk management and control procedures, Delta Lloyd will continue to provide to Aviva the relevant information to satisfy its legal, regulatory requirements in line with the Strategic Investment Agreement.
This includes other certifications as required in connection with Avivas UK listing.
Aviva is entitled to nominate, and propose replacements, for two Supervisory Board members.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss as a result of the default or failure of third parties to meet their payment obligations to Aviva, or variations in market values as a result of changes in expectations related to these risks.
Credit risk arises as a consequence of asset investments made to achieve the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to provide enhanced long-term risk-adjusted returns to shareholders.
Aviva is exposed to third party credit quality changes through a range of other activities including reinsurance.
Credit risk is an area where we can provide the returns required to satisfy policyholder liabilities and to generate returns for our shareholders.
In general we prefer to take credit risk over equity and property risks, due to the better expected risk adjusted return, our credit risk analysis capability and the structural investment advantages conferred to insurers with long-dated, relatively illiquid liabilities.
294 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued Our approach to managing credit risk recognises that there is a risk of adverse financial impact resulting from fluctuations in credit quality of third parties including default, rating transition and credit spread movements.
Credit risk categories include spread risk, default risk and rating migration risk: Spread risk arises from changes in level or volatility of third party credit spreads over risk-free interest rates, that can be caused by credit concerns improving or worsening on the issuer, or from market factors, such as risk appetite and liquidity within the market.
Default risk is the risk that a counterparty is unable or unwilling to meet its financial obligations when they fall due, and includes delays in repayments, restructuring of repayments interest schedule and bankruptcy.
Rating migration risk is the risk that a change in external credit rating of a counterparty adversely impacts Aviva.
Our credit risks arise principally through exposures to debt security investments, structured asset investments, derivative counterparties, mortgage lending and reinsurance counterparties.
The group manages its credit risk at business unit, regional and group levels.
All business units and regions are required to implement local credit risk management processes including limits frameworks, operate specific risk management committees, and ensure detailed reporting and monitoring of their exposures against pre-established risk criteria.
At group level, we manage and monitor all exposures across our business units on a consolidated basis, and operate a group limit framework that must be adhered to by all.
Management of credit risk is effected through six core elements: The setting up of an overall credit risk appetite by the Board Risk Committee, which controls the total credit risk to which the group is exposed.
The maintenance of and adherence to an effective governance structure.
This includes clear guidance, scope and frameworks for all aspects of the management of the credit to ensure accountability and clarity including clear delegations of authority and a group wide credit risk policy and associated business standards.
The accurate and timely reporting of detailed exposure information, and their aggregation by counterparty, exposure types, sectors, geography and ratings.
The implementation of a sophisticated capital charge-based credit limit framework that considers and quantifies the key specific attributes of each exposure e. g. seniority, maturity, etc and provides a counterparty level aggregation methodology covering all exposures to a counterparty.
This is then managed against centrally set limits.
Gross exposure limits are also set to ensure that any unexpected jump to default risks are appropriately restricted.
Additional limit and controls are applied for structured assets and reinsurance counterparty exposures.
Additional committee and risk function oversight is provided on all credit risk related matters.
This includes regular consideration and review of our key counterparties, systemic factors such as sector and geographic concentrations, monitoring and addressing key credit themes and news that emerge in the markets.
The Credit Approvals Committee provides a forum to ensure that all key recommendations are considered, and decisions implemented throughout the group.
The regional and group ALM and risk functions ensure that qualitative aspects of risk management are considered and evaluated to provide further oversight and balance to the quantitative aspects.
Risk mitigation techniques are used where and when deemed appropriate.
These are utilised where possible to remove residual unwanted risks, as well as to bring or keep exposure limits within appetite, and include methods such as collateralisation and the purchase of credit protection such as credit default index swaps.
Collateral held either takes the form of cash, disclosed in note 49 as a payable, or other financial assets, disclosed in note 25 d. Where a financial asset is recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value, that value reflects the credit enhancement as a result of the relevant collateral received.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 295 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued A detailed breakdown of the groups current credit exposure by credit quality is shown below.
Financial exposures by credit ratings Financial assets are graded according to current external credit ratings issued.
AAA is the highest possible rating.
Investment grade financial assets are classified within the range of AAA to BBB ratings.
Financial assets which fall outside this range are classified as sub-investment grade.
The following table provides information regarding the aggregated credit risk exposure, for financial assets with external credit ratings, of the group.
Not rated assets capture assets not rated by external ratings agencies.

Gross of non-controlling interests, our direct shareholder assets exposure to the governments and local authorities and agencies of Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain has reduced since 2010 and is detailed in note 25 e on page 240.
We continue to monitor closely the situation in the eurozone and have had additional restrictions on further investment in place since late 2009 as well as taking actions to reduce exposure to higher-risk assets.
296 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued Other investments Other investments including assets of operations classified as held for sale 217 million include: 27,260 million of unit trusts and other investment vehicles.
The underlying credit ratings of these assets are not reflected in this analysis.
Derivative financial instruments of 1,498 million, representing positions to mitigate the impact of adverse market movements.
Other assets of 1,619 million, including deposits with credit institutions and minority holdings in property management undertakings.
The group loan portfolio principally comprises: Policy loans which are generally collateralised by a lien or charge over the underlying policy.
Loans and advances to banks which primarily relate to loans of cash collateral received in stock lending transactions.
These loans are fully collateralised by other securities.
Mortgage loans collateralised by property assets.
Unit trusts and other investment vehicles The credit quality of the underlying debt securities within these vehicles is managed by the safeguards built into the investment mandates for these funds.
We rely on our understanding that the trusts and their asset managers are only approved if they satisfy certain selection criteria including due diligence in the form of a questionnaire and or research by dedicated teams.
In addition, the asset managers are mandated to make investments in line with the funds risk profiles as marketed to prospective customers and policyholders.
Accordingly, as part of reviewing the asset quality of unit trusts and other investment vehicles, we monitor the assets within the funds and their performance to ensure they remain in line with the respective investment mandates for these funds.
A proportion of the assets underlying these investments are represented by equities and so credit ratings are not generally applicable.
Equity exposures are managed against agreed benchmarks that are set with reference to overall market risk appetite.
Loans The majority of the group loans portfolio is unrated.
However, we use the following metrics to internally monitor our exposure: property collateralisation i. e. loan to value : interest and debt service cover: and diversity of the tenant base.
Policy loans are loans and advances made to policyholders, and are collateralised by the underlying policies.
As such, we believe such collateralisation minimises our risk.
Credit concentration risk The long-term businesses and general insurance businesses are generally not individually exposed to significant concentrations of credit risk due to the regulations, applicable in most markets, limiting investments in individual assets and asset classes supplemented by the group credit policy, associated business standards and the credit limits framework.
In cases where the business is particularly exposed to credit risk e. g. in respect of defaults on mortgages matching annuity liabilities this risk is translated into a more conservative discount rate used to value the liabilities, creating a greater capital requirement.
The impact of aggregation of credit risk is monitored as described above.
With the exception of government bonds, the largest aggregated counterparty exposure is approximately 1.2% of the Groups total shareholder assets.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 297 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued Reinsurance credit exposures The Group is exposed to concentrations of risk with individual reinsurers, due to the nature of the reinsurance market and the restricted range of reinsurers that have acceptable credit ratings.
The Group operates a policy to manage its reinsurance counterparty exposures, by limiting the reinsurers that may be used and applying strict limits to each reinsurer.
Reinsurance exposures are aggregated with other exposures to ensure that the overall risk is within appetite.
The Credit Approvals Committee has a monitoring role over this risk.
The Groups largest reinsurance counterparty is Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd including subsidiaries.
At 31 December 2011, the reinsurance asset recoverable, including debtor balances, from Swiss Reinsurance Company Ltd was 1,314 million.
Securities finance The Group has significant securities financing operations within the UK and smaller operations overseas.
The risks within this business are mitigated by  and minimum counterparty credit quality requirements which are designed to result in minimal residual risk.
The Group operates strict standards around collateral management, margin calls and controls.
Derivative credit exposures The Group is exposed to counterparty credit risk through derivative trades.
This risk is mitigated through collateralising almost all trades the exception being certain FX trades where it has historically been the market norm not to collateralise.
The Group operates strict standards around collateral management and controls, including the requirement that all Over the Counter derivatives are supported by credit support annexes and ISDAs or their local equivalents unless otherwise agreed with the Group ALM team.
Counterparties must have a minimum credit rating from rating agencies S&P, Moodys and Fitch and the collateral process must meet certain minimum standards as set out by Group guidelines.
Residual exposures are captured within the Groups credit management framework.
Many of the largest shareholder notional positions are exchange traded, rather than over the counter OTC, with the added protection that provides i. e. mitigated significantly through the protection offered by the exchange and is controlled by the Groups local asset management operations.
Unit-linked business As discussed previously, in unit-linked business the policyholder bears the market risk and credit risk, on investment assets in the unit funds, and the shareholders exposure to credit risk is limited to the extent that their income arises from asset management charges based on the value of assets in the fund.
Impairment of financial assets The following table provides information regarding the carrying value of financial assets that have been impaired and the ageing of financial assets that are past due but not impaired.

The credit quality of financial assets is managed at the local business unit level.
Where assets have been classed as past due and impaired, an analysis is made of the risk of default and a decision is made whether to seek collateral from the counterparty.
There were no material financial assets that would have been past due or impaired had the terms not been renegotiated.
298 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued c Market risk Market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in fair values or future cash flows of financial instruments from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, property and commodity prices.
Market risk arises in business units due to fluctuations in both the value of liabilities and the value of investments held.
At Group level, it also arises in relation to the overall portfolio of international businesses and in the value of investment assets owned directly by the shareholders.
The Group has established a policy on market risk which sets out the principles that businesses are expected to adopt in respect of management of the key market risks to which the Group is exposed.
The Group monitors adherence to this market risk policy and regularly reviews how business units are managing these risks locally, through the Assets Committee and ultimately the Asset Liability Committee ALCO.
For each of the major components of market risk, described in more detail below, the Group has put in place additional processes and procedures, described in internal business standards, to set out how each risk should be managed and monitored, and the approach to setting an appropriate risk appetite.
The management of market risk is undertaken in businesses, regions and at group level.
Businesses manage market risks locally using the Group market risk framework and within local regulatory constraints.
The ALM function is responsible for managing market risk at Group level.
The Group market risk policy sets out the minimum principles and framework for matching liabilities with appropriate assets, the approaches to be taken when liabilities cannot be matched and the monitoring processes that are required.
The Group has criteria for matching assets and liabilities for all classes of business to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and the liabilities due to market movements.
The local regulatory environment for each business will also set the conditions under which assets and liabilities are to be matched.
In addition, where the Groups long-term savings businesses have written insurance and investment products where the majority of investment risks are borne by its policyholders, these risks are managed in line with local regulations and marketing literature, in order to satisfy the policyholders risk and reward objectives.
The Group writes unit-linked business in a number of its operations.
In unit-linked business, the policyholder bears the investment risk on the assets held in the unit-linked funds, as the policy benefits are directly linked to the value of the assets in the fund.
The shareholders exposure to market risk on this business is limited to the extent that income arising from asset management charges is based on the value of assets in the fund.
Equity price risk The Group is subject to equity price risk due to daily changes in the market values of its equity securities portfolio.
The Groups shareholders are exposed to the following sources of equity risk: Direct equity shareholdings in shareholder funds and the Group defined benefit pension funds.
The indirect impact from changes in the value of equities held in policyholders funds from which management charges or a share of performance are taken.
Its interest in the free estate of long-term with-profits funds.
We continue to limit our direct equity exposure in line with our risk preferences for equity risk.
The reduction of the shareholding in Delta Lloyd has decreased the Groups IFRS balance sheet risks and, in particular, has led to a fall in equity exposures.
The sale of the RAC business has also reduced our strategic equity exposure and our extended equity hedging programme during 2011 has further reduced our equity exposures.
At a business unit level, equity price risk is actively managed in order to mitigate anticipated unfavourable market movements where this lies outside the risk appetite of either the Company in respect of shareholder assets or the fund in respect of policyholder assets concerned.
In addition investment limits and local asset admissibility regulations require that business units hold diversified portfolios of assets thereby reducing exposure to individual equities.
The Group does not have material holdings of unquoted equity securities.
Equity risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures and options.
Businesses actively model the performance of equities through the use of risk models, in particular to understand the impact of equity performance on guarantees, options and bonus rates.
At 31 December 2011 the Groups shareholder funds held 3 billion notional of equity hedges, with up to 12 months to maturity with an average strike of 89% of the prevailing market levels on 31 December 2011.
The Assets Committee actively monitors the Groups equity exposures relative to risk appetite.
Sensitivity to changes in equity prices is given in section h below.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 299 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued Property price risk The Group is subject to property price risk due to holdings of investment properties in a variety of locations worldwide and through investments in mortgages and mortgage-backed securities.
Investment in property is managed at regional and business level, and will be subject to local regulations on asset admissibility, liquidity requirements and the expectations of policyholders as well as overall risk appetite.
The Assets Committee also monitors the Groups property exposure, relative to risk appetite As at 31 December 2011, no material derivative contracts had been entered into to mitigate the effects of changes in property prices.
Sensitivity to changes in property prices is given in section h below.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises primarily from the Groups investments in long-term debt and fixed income securities and their movement relative to the value placed on the insurance liabilities.
A number of policyholder participation features have an influence on the groups interest rate risk.
The major features include guaranteed surrender values, guaranteed annuity options, and minimum surrender and maturity values.
Details of material guarantees and options are given in note 41.
Interest rate risk is managed by the ALM function and monitored and managed at Group level by the Assets Committee, and the Asset Liability Committee.
Exposure to interest rate risk is monitored through several measures that include value-at-risk analysis, position limits, risk modelling stress and scenario tests, asset and liability matching using measures such as duration.
The Group has a general preference for minimising interest rate risk where practical and has also set a quantitative group level interest rate risk appetite.
The impact of exposure to sustained low interest rates is regularly monitored.
The Group manages this risk by adopting close asset liability matching criteria, to minimise the impact of mismatches between the value of assets and liabilities from interest rate movements.
Interest rate risk is also managed using a variety of derivative instruments, including futures, options, swaps, caps and floors, in order to provide a degree of hedging against unfavourable market movements in interest rates inherent in the assets backing technical liabilities.
Sensitivity to changes in interest rates is given in section h below.
Further information on borrowings is included in note 48.
Currency risk The Group has minimal exposure to currency risk from financial instruments held by business units in currencies other than their functional currencies, as nearly all such holdings are backing either unit-linked or with-profit contract liabilities or are hedged.
For this reason, no sensitivity analysis is given for these holdings.
The Group operates internationally and as a result is exposed to foreign currency exchange risk arising from fluctuations in exchange rates of various currencies.
Approximately half of the groups premium income arises in currencies other than sterling and the Groups net assets are denominated in a variety of currencies, of which the largest are euro, sterling and US dollars.
The Group does not hedge foreign currency revenues as these are substantially retained locally to support the growth of the Groups business and meet local regulatory and market requirements.
The Groups foreign exchange standard requires that each of our subsidiaries should aim to maintain sufficient assets in its local currency to meet local currency liabilities and to report any material mismatches.
Therefore, capital held by the Groups business units should generally be able to support local business activities regardless of foreign currency movements.
However, such movements may impact the value of the Groups consolidated shareholders equity which is expressed in sterling.
This aspect of foreign exchange risk is monitored and managed centrally, against pre-determined limits.
The Groups approach is to manage these exposures by aligning the deployment of regulatory capital by currency with the Groups regulatory capital requirements by currency.
Limits are set to control the extent to which the deployment of capital is not aligned fully with the Groups regulatory capital requirement for each major currency.
Currency borrowings and derivatives are used to manage exposures within the limits that have been set.
300 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued At 31 December 2011 and 2010, the Groups total equity deployment by currency was: Sterling Euro US$ Other Total m m m m m Capital 31 December 2011 3,427 6,442 3,237 2,257 15,363 Capital 31 December 2010 3,301 9,288 2,712 2,424 17,725 A 10% change in sterling to euro US$ foreign exchange rates would have had the following impact on total equity: 10% 10% 10% 10% increase decrease increase decrease in sterling in sterling in sterling in sterling euro rate euro rate US$ rate US$ rate m m m m Net assets at 31 December 2011 524 632 323 323 Net assets at 31 December 2010 899 833 271 271 The changes arise from retranslation of business unit statements of financial position from their functional currencies into sterling, with above movements being taken through the currency translation reserve.
These movements in exchange rates therefore have no impact on profit.
Net assets are stated after taking account of the effect of currency hedging activities.
Derivatives risk Derivatives are used by a number of the businesses, within policy guidelines agreed by the Board of directors, as set out in the Group policy on derivatives use.
Activity is overseen by the Derivatives Approvals Committee, which monitors implementation of the policy, exposure levels and approves large or complex transactions proposed by businesses.
Derivatives are primarily used for efficient investment management, risk hedging purposes or to structure specific retail savings products.
Derivative transactions are covered by either cash or corresponding assets and liabilities.
Speculative activity is prohibited, unless prior approval has been obtained from the Derivatives Approvals Committee.
As noted above, over-the-counter derivative contracts are entered into only with approved counterparties and using ISDA documentation and credit support annexes or equivalent unless otherwise agreed by the Group ALM function.
Adherence to the collateral requirements as set out in the relevant internal business standards thereby reduces the risk of credit loss.
The Group applies strict requirements to the administration and valuation processes it uses, and has a control framework that is consistent with market and industry practice for the activity that is undertaken.
Correlation risk The Group recognises that lapse behaviour and potential increases in consumer expectations are sensitive to and interdependent with market movements and interest rates.
These interdependencies are taken into consideration in the internal economic capital model and in scenario analysis.
d Liquidity risk At Group level, there is a liquidity risk appetite which requires that sufficient liquid resources be maintained to cover net outflows in a stress scenario.
The Group and Company have a strong liquidity position 1.5 billion of financial assets held at group and through the application of a Group liquidity risk policy and business standard seek to maintain sufficient financial resources to meet their obligations as they fall due.
In addition to this strong liquidity position, the Group and Company maintain significant undrawn committed borrowing facilities 2.1 billion from a range of leading international banks to further mitigate this risk.
The Group has also implemented a liquidity risk policy and framework to ensure that businesses within the Group also maintain sufficient liquidity to withstand adverse scenarios.
Maturity analyses The following tables show the maturities of our insurance and investment contract liabilities, and of the financial and reinsurance assets to meet them.
A maturity analysis of the contractual amounts payable for borrowings and derivatives is given in notes 48 and 57, respectively.
Contractual obligations under operating leases and capital commitments are given in note 52. i Analysis of maturity of insurance and investment contract liabilities For non-linked insurance business, the following table shows the gross liability at 31 December 2011 and 2010 analysed by remaining duration.
The total liability is split by remaining duration in proportion to the cash-flows expected to arise during that period, as permitted under IFRS 4, Insurance Contracts.
Almost all investment contracts may be surrendered or transferred on demand.
For such contracts, the earliest contractual maturity date is therefore the current statement of financial position date, for a surrender amount approximately equal to the current statement of financial position liability.
We expect surrenders, transfers and maturities to occur over many years, and the tables reflect the expected cash flows for non-linked investment contracts.
However, contractually, the total liability for non-linked investment contracts of 59,690 million 2010: 63,197 million would be shown in the within 1 year column below.
Unit-linked contracts are repayable or transferable on demand and are therefore shown in the within 1 year column.

Where an instrument is transferable back to the issuer on demand, such as most unit trusts or similar types of investment vehicle, it is included in the On demand or within 1 year column.
Debt securities with no fixed contractual maturity date are generally callable at the option of the issuer at the date the coupon rate is reset under the contractual terms of the instrument.
The terms for resetting the coupon are such that we expect the securities to be redeemed at this date, as it would be uneconomic for the issuer not to do so, and for liquidity management purposes we manage these securities on this basis.
The first repricing and call date is normally ten years or more after the date of issuance.
Most of the Groups investments in equity securities and fixed maturity securities are market traded and therefore, if required, can be liquidated for cash at short notice.
e Insurance risk i Life insurance risk Types of risk Life insurance risk in the Group arises through its exposure to mortality and morbidity insurance and exposure to worse than anticipated operating experience on factors such as persistency levels and management and administration expenses.
Risk management framework The Group has developed a life insurance risk policy and associated business standards covering various aspects of life insurance risk management.
Individual life insurance risks are managed at a business unit level but are also monitored at group level.
The Group Insurance Committee monitors the application of the risk policy in each business, and receives management information on life insurance risks including experience data, analysis of change and economic capital consumption.
302 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued The committee considers all areas of life insurance risk, but in particular has a remit to monitor mortality, longevity, morbidity, persistency, product development and pricing, unit pricing and expenses.
The committee also considers the reinsurance coverage across the life businesses.
It confirms that guidance and procedures are in place for each of the major components of life insurance risk, and that the businesses mitigate against any life insurance risk outside local appetite, within the parameters for the overall Group risk appetite.
The committee has also developed guidance for business units on management of a number of areas of life insurance risk to ensure best practice is shared throughout the Group and common standards are adopted.
Management of life insurance risks The risk profile of our life insurance risks, primarily persistency, longevity, mortality and expense risk, has remained stable during 2011.
Persistency risk remains significant and continues to have a volatile outlook with underlying performance linked to some degree to economic conditions.
However, businesses across the Group have continued to make progress with a range of customer retention activities.
The Group has continued to write strong volumes of life protection business, and to utilise reinsurance to reduce exposure to potential losses.
More generally, life insurance risks are believed to benefit from a significant diversification against other risks in the portfolio.
The individual life insurance risks are managed as follows: Mortality and morbidity risks are mitigated by use of reinsurance.
The Group allows business units to select reinsurers, from those approved by the Group, based on local factors, but assesses the overall programme to manage group-wide risk exposures and monitor that the aggregation of risk ceded to individual reinsurers is within appetite for credit risk.
Longevity risk and internal experience analysis are carefully monitored against the latest external industry data and emerging trends.
While individual businesses are responsible for reserving and pricing for annuity business, the Group monitors the exposure to this risk and the capital implications to manage the impact on the group-wide exposure and the capital funding that businesses may require as a consequence.
The Group has used reinsurance solutions to reduce the risks from longevity and continually monitors and evaluates emerging market solutions to mitigate this risk further.
Persistency risk is managed at a business unit level through frequent monitoring of company experience, benchmarked against local market information.
Generally, persistency risk arises from customers lapsing their policies earlier than has been assumed.
Where possible the financial impact of lapses is reduced through appropriate product design.
Businesses also implement specific initiatives to improve retention of policies which may otherwise lapse.
The Group Insurance Committee has developed guidelines on persistency management.
Product design and pricing risk arises from poorly designed or inadequately priced products and can lead to both financial loss for and reputation damage to the Group.
Business standards have been developed to support the businesses through the complete cycle of the product development process, financial analysis and pricing, and through the review of existing products.
Expense risk is primarily managed by the business units through the assessment of business unit profitability and frequent monitoring of expense levels.
In addition to economic capital modelling, sensitivity testing is used to measure the capital required and volatility in earnings due to exposure to life insurance risks, typically through MCEV reporting examples of which are contained elsewhere in this report.
This assessment is made at both business unit level and at group level where the impact of aggregation of similar risks can be measured and is supplemented by scenario analysis.
This enables the group to determine whether action is required to reduce risk, or whether that risk is within the overall risk appetite.
Embedded derivatives The Group has exposure to a variety of embedded derivatives in its long-term savings business due to product features offering varying degrees of guaranteed benefits at maturity or on early surrender, along with options to convert their benefits into different products on pre-agreed terms.
The extent of the impact of these embedded derivatives differs considerably between business units and exposes Aviva to changes in policyholder behaviour in the exercise of options as well as market risk.
Examples of each type of embedded derivative affecting the Group are: Options: call, put, surrender and maturity options, guaranteed annuity options, options to cease premium payment, options for withdrawals free of market value adjustment, annuity options, and guaranteed insurability options.
Guarantees: embedded floor guaranteed return, maturity guarantee, guaranteed death benefit, and guaranteed minimum rate of annuity payment.
Other: indexed interest or principal payments, maturity value, loyalty bonus.
The impact of these is reflected in the economic capital model and MCEV reporting and managed as part of the asset liability framework.
ii General insurance risk Types of risk General insurance risk in the Group arises from: fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of claims and claim settlements relative to expectations: unexpected claims arising from a single source: inaccurate pricing of risks or inappropriate underwriting of risks when underwritten: inadequate reinsurance protection or other risk transfer techniques: and inadequate reserves.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 303 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued The majority of the general insurance business underwritten by the Group is of a short tail nature such as motor, household and commercial property insurances.
The Groups underwriting strategy and appetite is agreed by the Executive Committee and communicated via specific policy statements and guidelines.
Like life insurance risk, general insurance risk is managed primarily at business unit level with oversight at a group level, through the Group Insurance Committee.
The vast majority of the Groups general insurance business is managed and priced in the same country as the domicile of the customer.
Management of general insurance risks Significant insurance risks will be reported through the risk management framework.
Additionally, the economic capital model is used to assess the risks that each general insurance business unit, and the group as a whole, is exposed to, quantifying their impact and calculating appropriate capital requirements.
All general insurance business units undertake a quarterly review of their insurance risks, the output from which is a key input into the economic capital assessments.
The Group Insurance Committee monitors and develops the management of insurance risk in the general insurance business units, and assesses the aggregate risk exposure.
It is responsible for the development and review of the group policies and business standards for underwriting, claims, reinsurance and reserving that form part of the risk management framework.
Business units have developed mechanisms that identify, quantify and manage accumulated exposures to contain them within the limits of the appetite of the Group.
The Group has pioneered various developments, such as the Aviva UK Digital Flood Map to effectively manage exposures arising from specific perils.
Where appropriate such projects are employed throughout the business units to promote the adoption of best practice as standard.
General insurance claims reserving Actuarial claims reserving is conducted by local actuaries in the various general insurance business units according to the General Insurance Reserving policy business standard.
The Group Insurance Committee monitors and maintains the general insurance reserving policy business standard, and conducts quarterly reviews of the Groups general insurance claims provisions, and their adequacy.
The reviews include peer reviews of the business units own conclusions as well as independent analysis to confirm the reasonableness of the local reviews.
The adequacy of the Groups general insurance claims provisions is ultimately overseen by the Group Insurance Committee.
A number of business units also have periodic external reviews by local consultant actuaries often as part of the local regulatory requirement.
Reinsurance strategy The purchase of reinsurance is governed by the reinsurance standards for both life and general insurance recently introduced by the Group.
The standards set out the Groups minimum requirements required to achieve a consistent approach to the assessment, management, retention and placement of reinsurance across the Group.
Significant reinsurance purchases are reviewed annually at both business unit and Group level, to verify that the levels of protection being bought reflect any developments in exposure and the risk appetite of the Group.
Reinsurance purchases must be in line with the objectives set out in the Group reinsurance business standards.
The basis of these purchases is underpinned by analysis of economic capital, economic gain, earnings volatility, liquidity, retained risk exposure profile and the Groups franchise value.
Detailed actuarial analysis is used to calculate the groups extreme risk profile and then design cost and capital efficient reinsurance programmes to mitigate these risks to within agreed appetites.
For businesses writing general insurance we will analyse the natural catastrophe exposure using external probabilistic catastrophe models widely used by the rest of the re insurance industry.
The catastrophe accumulations and loss probabilities based on the Groups specific portfolios of business are reviewed internally to ensure the losses from individual territories, or from our peak exposure zone Northern Europe, are within acceptable limits.
Processes are in place to manage catastrophe risk in individual business units and at a group level.
The Group cedes much of its worldwide catastrophe risk to third-party reinsurers but retains a pooled element for its own account gaining diversification benefit.
The total Group potential loss from its most concentrated catastrophe exposure zone Northern Europe excluding Delta Lloyd is approximately 280 million, for a one in ten year annual loss scenario, compared to approximately 490 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.
In our 2009 and 2010 Report and Accounts we reported our participation in a share of a reinsurers US property catastrophe portfolio.
Under this arrangement we assume exposure from Hiscox plc that does not correlate with the Groups other general insurance exposures and therefore provides an opportunity to diversify the general insurance portfolio.
For the 2011 underwriting year the modelled loss from a one in ten year annual loss scenario was 40 million compared to approximately 100 million when measured on a one in a hundred year annual loss scenario.
The arrangement has been renewed for the 2012 underwriting year based on a similar level of participation.
f Operational risk Types of operational risk Operational risk is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, or from people and systems, or from external events.
Operational risks include business protection, information technology, people, legal and regulatory compliance risks.
Operational risk management We process a large number of complex transactions across numerous and diverse products, and are highly dependent on the proper functioning of information technology and communications systems.
We are partially reliant on the operational processing performance of our outsourced partners including certain servicing and IT functions.
The long-term nature of our business means that accurate records have to be maintained for significant periods.
Significant resources are devoted to maintaining efficient and effective operations within our framework of corporate responsibility, policies, business standards and business ethics code.
304 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Risk management continued Our businesses are primarily responsible for identifying and managing operational risks in line with minimum standards of control set out in our policies and business standards.
Each operational risk is assessed by considering the potential impact and the probability of the event occurring.
Business management teams must be satisfied that all material risks falling outside our risk tolerances are being mitigated, monitored and reported to an appropriate level.
Any risks with a high potential impact level are monitored centrally on a regular basis.
Businesses use key indicator data to help monitor the status of the risk and control environment.
They also identify and capture loss events, taking appropriate action to address actual control breakdowns and promote internal learning from these occurrences.
The Operational Risk Committee ORC oversees the Groups aggregate operational risk exposure on behalf of the Group Executive Committee.
It makes recommendations on the risk appetite that the Group can work within for operational risk, assesses and monitors overall operational risk exposures, identifying any concentrations of operational risk across the Group, and in particular verifies that mitigating action plans are implemented.
g Brand and reputation risk Brand and reputation risk is the risk of loss of franchise value due to damage to our brand or our reputation with customers, distributors, investors and regulators.
Our success and results are, to a certain extent, dependent on the strength of our global Aviva brand and reputation.
While we as a group are well recognised, we are vulnerable to adverse market and customer perception.
We operate in an industry where integrity, customer trust and confidence are paramount.
We are exposed to the risk that litigation, employee misconduct, operational failures, the outcome of regulatory investigations, media speculation and negative publicity, disclosure of confidential client information, inadequate services, among others, whether or not founded, could impact our brands or reputation.
Any of our brands or our reputation could also be affected if products or services recommended by us or any of our intermediaries do not perform as expected whether or not the expectations are founded or the customers expectations for the product change.
One of the FSAs strategic objectives is to help customers get a fair deal through its treating customers fairly principle.
Examples of treating customers fairly include: products and services targeted to meet customers needs and which perform in line with what customers have been led to expect: clear information and advice where relevant : good service: and making sure there are no unfair barriers that prevent customers from getting access to their money, changing products or making a successful insurance claim.
The FSA regularly checks that we are meeting the requirement to treat our customers fairly and we make use of various metrics to assess our own performance, including customer advocacy, retention and complaints.
Failure to meet these requirements could also impact our brands or reputation.
If we do not manage successfully the perception of our brands and reputation, it could cause existing customers or agents to withdraw from our business and potential customers or agents to be reluctant or elect not to do business with us.
This would adversely impact our business and results of operations.
h Risk and capital management Sensitivity test analysis The Group uses a number of sensitivity test-based risk management tools to understand the volatility of earnings, the volatility of its capital requirements, and to manage its capital more efficiently.
Sensitivities to economic and operating experience are regularly produced on the Groups key financial performance metrics to inform the Groups decision making and planning processes, and as part of the framework for identifying and quantifying the risks to which each of its business units, and the Group as a whole, are exposed.
For long-term business in particular, sensitivities of MCEV performance indicators to changes in both economic and non-economic experience are continually used to manage the business and to inform the decision making process.
More information on MCEV sensitivities can be found in the presentation of results on an MCEV basis in the supplementary section of this report.
Life insurance and investment contracts The nature of long-term business is such that a number of assumptions are made in compiling these financial statements.
Assumptions are made about investment returns, expenses, mortality rates and persistency in connection with the in-force policies for each business unit.
Assumptions are best estimates based on historic and expected experience of the business.
A number of the key assumptions for the Groups central scenario are disclosed elsewhere in these statements for both IFRS reporting and reporting under MCEV methodology.
For participating funds, a negative unallocated divisible surplus UDS may be held, subject to recoverability from margins in the participating business liabilities, with any irrecoverable amount charged to net income.
The amount of negative UDS that is recoverable is sensitive to movements in risk-free interest rates and credit spreads on the participating fixed interest assets.
The increase in interest rate sensitivities for participating investment contracts between 2010 and 2011 primarily reflects the widening of credit spreads on bonds in Italy.
An increase in interest rates would increase the amount of irrecoverable UDS that is charged to net income, while a reduction in interest rates would allow the reversal of losses incurred in previous periods.
General insurance and health business General insurance and health claim liabilities are estimated by using standard actuarial claims projection techniques.
These methods extrapolate the claims development for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made as projections are based on assumptions implicit in the historic claims.

The sensitivities to economic movements relate mainly to business in the UK and the US for continuing operations, and the Netherlands for discontinued operations.
In general, a fall in market interest rates has a beneficial impact on non-participating business and shareholders funds, due to the increase in market value of fixed interest securities and the relative durations of assets and liabilities: similarly a rise in interest rates has a negative impact.
In the US, most debt securities are classified as AFS, which limits the overall sensitivity of IFRS profit to interest rate movements.
The mortality sensitivities relate primarily to the UK.
Changes in sensitivities between 2010 and 2011 reflect movements in market interest rates, portfolio growth, changes to asset mix and the relative durations of assets and liabilities and asset liability management actions.
The impact on the Groups results from sensitivity to these assumptions can also be found in the MCEV sensitivities included in the alternative method of reporting long-term business profits section.

In reality, there is a correlation between the assumptions and other factors.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are non-linear, and larger or smaller impacts should not be interpolated or extrapolated from these results.
The sensitivity analyses do not take into consideration that the Groups assets and liabilities are actively managed.
Additionally, the financial position of the Group may vary at the time that any actual market movement occurs.
For example, the Groups financial risk management strategy aims to manage the exposure to market fluctuations.
As investment markets move past various trigger levels, management actions could include selling investments, changing investment portfolio allocation, adjusting bonuses credited to policyholders, and taking other protective action.
A number of the business units use passive assumptions to calculate their long-term business liabilities.
Consequently, a change in the underlying assumptions may not have any impact on the liabilities, whereas assets held at market value in the statement of financial position will be affected.
In these circumstances, the different measurement bases for liabilities and assets may lead to volatility in shareholder equity.
Similarly, for general insurance liabilities, the interest rate sensitivities only affect profit and equity where explicit assumptions are made regarding interest discount rates or future inflation.
Other limitations in the above sensitivity analyses include the use of hypothetical market movements to demonstrate potential risk that only represent the Groups view of possible near-term market changes that cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the assumption that all interest rates move in an identical fashion.
57 Derivative financial instruments and hedging This note gives details of the various instruments we use to mitigate risk.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments, including both exchange traded and over-the-counter instruments, in line with our overall risk management strategy.
The objectives include managing exposure to price, foreign currency and or interest rate risk on existing assets or liabilities, as well as planned or anticipated investment purchases.
In the narrative and tables below, figures are given for both the notional amounts and fair values of these instruments.
The notional amounts reflect the aggregate of individual derivative positions on a gross basis and so give an indication of the overall scale of the derivative transaction.
They do not reflect current market values of the open positions.
The fair values represent the gross carrying values at the year end for each class of derivative contract held or issued by the Group.
The fair values do not provide an indication of credit risk, as many over-the-counter transactions are contracted and documented under ISDA International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. master agreements or their equivalent.
Such agreements are designed to provide a legally enforceable set-off in the event of default, which reduces credit exposure.
In addition, the Group has collateral agreements in place between the individual Group entities and relevant counterparties.
a Instruments qualifying for hedge accounting The Group has formally assessed and documented the effectiveness of its instruments qualifying for hedge accounting in accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
To aid discussion and analysis, these instruments are analysed into cash flow, fair value and net investment hedges, as detailed below.
Performance review Corporate responsibility Governance Shareholder information Financial statements IFRS Financial statements MCEV Other information 309 Aviva plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 Derivative financial instruments and hedging continued i Cash flow hedges During 2010, the cash flow hedges were discontinued.
The Group has therefore no cash flow hedges to report.
ii Fair value hedges The Group entered into a number of interest rate swaps in order to hedge fluctuations in the fair value part of its portfolio of mortgage loans and debt securities in the US.
The notional value of these interest rate swaps was 844 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 2,170 million and their fair value was 77 million liability 2010: 74 million liability.
These hedges were fully effective during the year.
iii Net investment hedges To reduce its exposure to foreign currency risk, the Group has entered into the following net investment hedges: The Group has designated a portion of its euro and US dollar denominated debt as a hedge of the net investment in its European and American subsidiaries.
The carrying value of the debt at 31 December 2011 was 1,815 million 2010: 2,791 million and its fair value at that date was 1,694 million 2010: 2,811 million.
The decrease in the value of debt designated as a hedge of net investment is due to the repayment of an 800 million hybrid debt instrument in November 2011 combined with a depreciation in the euro versus sterling.
The foreign exchange gain of 30 million 2010: gain of 53 million on translation of the debt to sterling at the statement of financial position date has been recognised in the hedging instruments reserve in shareholders equity.
This hedge was fully effective throughout the current and prior years.
b Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting Certain derivatives either do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39 or the option to hedge account has not been taken.
These are referred to below as non-hedge derivatives.
