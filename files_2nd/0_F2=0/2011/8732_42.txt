Financial instruments continued Risk management The Groups operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in exchange rates, interest rates, credit risk and its liquidity position.
The Group manages these risks through the use of derivative instruments, which are reviewed on a regular basis.
Derivative instruments are not entered into for speculative purposes.
There are no concentrations of risk in the period to 29 January 2011.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Groups borrowings are at floating rates, partially hedged by floating rate interest on deposits, reflecting the seasonality of its cash flow.
Interest rate risk therefore arises from bank borrowings.
The Board regularly reviews the interest rate risk of the Group and uses interest rate swaps to minimise exposure to interest rate fluctuations where appropriate.
Given that the Groups syndicated facility was not drawn down during the year, the Board did not consider that an interest rate swap on the floating rate facility was necessary in the period to 29 January 2011.
The net fair value of swap liabilities at 29 January 2011 was nil 2010: nil.
The Group has potential bank floating rate financial liabilities on its revolving credit facility, together with overdraft facilities in subsidiary companies see note 23.
There were no drawdowns from the revolving credit facility at 29 January 2011 2010: nil thereby minimising the Groups interest rate risk at the year end.
When drawdowns are made, the Group is exposed to cash flow interest risk.
Under the new facility see note 35 interest is paid at a rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.25% previous facility: 0.75%.
As at 29 January 2011 and 30 January 2010, the Group has no liabilities in respect of finance lease or similar hire purchase contracts.
A change of 1.0% in the average interest rates during the year, applied to the Groups floating interest rate loans and borrowings as at the reporting date, would change profit before tax by 24,000 2010: 2,000 and would change equity by 24,000 2010: 2,000.
This assumes that all other variables remain unchanged.
Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year.
Foreign currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than pound sterling.
The currencies giving rise to this risk are the Euro and US Dollar with sales made in Euros and purchases made in both Euros and US Dollars principal exposure.
To protect its foreign currency position, the Group sets a buying rate in each country for the purchase of goods in US Dollars at the start of the buying season typically six to nine months before the product is received and then enters into a number of local currency US Dollar contracts whereby the minimum exchange rate on the purchase of dollars is guaranteed.
As at 29 January 2011, options have been entered into to protect approximately 93% of the US Dollar requirement for the period to January 2012.
The balance of the US Dollar requirement for the period will be satisfied by additional options or at spot rates.
Hedge accounting is not applied.
As at 29 January 2011, the fair value of these instruments was a liability of 789,000 2010: asset of 605,000 which has been included within current liabilities 2010: current assets.
A loss of 1,394,000 has been recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the change in fair value of these instruments.
A 10.0% strengthening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have reduced profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Euros 179 357 179 357 US Dollars 693 69 693 69 Australian Dollars 2 47 2 47 New Zealand Dollars 3 36 3 36 Other 23 3 23 3 896 512 896 512 A 10.0% weakening of sterling relative to the following currencies as at the reporting date would have increased profit before tax and equity as follows: Profit before tax Equity 2011 2010 2011 2010 000 000 000 000 Euros 219 392 219 392 US Dollars 848 76 848 76 Australian Dollars 2 52 2 52 New Zealand Dollars 3 40 3 40 Other 28 3 28 3 1,096 1,096 563 563 Calculations are performed on the same basis as the prior year and the method assumes that all other variables remain unchanged.

Financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from the possibility of customers and counterparties failing to meet their obligations to the Group.
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through major United Kingdom and European clearing banks, which must meet minimum credit ratings as required by the Board.
All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made for impairment where amounts are not thought to be recoverable see note 21.
At the reporting date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk and receivables which are not impaired are believed to be recoverable.
The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be equivalent to total trade and other receivables of 37,105,000 2010: 31,657,000, cash and cash equivalents of 90,131,000 2010: 64,524,000, deposits of 779,000 2010: 659,000 and key money of 8,419,000 2010: 8,553,000.
The Company has provided guarantees on banking facilities entered into by Topgrade Sportswear Limited, Nicholas Deakins Limited and Chausport SA totalling 2,000,000, 600,000 and 3,000,000 respectively.
In addition, the 70,000,000 revolving credit facility agreement, which was in place as at 29 January 2011, encompassed cross guarantees between the Company, RD Scott Limited, Bank Fashion Limited, Bank Stores Holdings Limited, Bank Stores Financing Limited, Athleisure Limited and First Sport Limited to the extent to which any of these companies were overdrawn.
As at 29 January 2011, these facilities were drawn down by nil 2010: nil.
Subsequent to the year end, a new committed borrowing facility of 75,000,000 has been agreed.
Further information on this new facility is provided in note 35.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirement to minimise net interest expense, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the operating needs of the business.
The forecast cash and borrowing profile of the Group is monitored on an ongoing basis, to ensure that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.
The Board review 13 week and annual cash flow forecasts each month.
Information about the maturity of the Groups financial liabilities is disclosed in note 23.
As at 29 January 2011, there were undrawn committed facilities with a maturity profile as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Expiring in less than one year 70,000 - Expiring in more than one year but no more than two years - 70,000 70,000 70,000 The commitment fee on these facilities is 0.34% 2010: 0.34%.
