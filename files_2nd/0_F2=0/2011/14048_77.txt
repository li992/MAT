Financial risk management continued 26 g Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables.
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty could default on its contractual obligations.
In this regard, the Groups principal exposure is to cash and cash equivalents, derivative transactions and trade receivables.
The Groups trade receivables credit risk is relatively low given that a high proportion of our customer base are government bodies with strong sovereign, or sovereign-like, credit ratings.
However, where the assessed creditworthiness of a customer, government or non government, falls below that considered acceptable, appropriate measures are taken to mitigate against the risk of contractual default using instruments such as credit guarantees.
The Groups Treasury function only transacts with counterparties that comply with Board policy.
The credit risk is measured by way of a counterparty credit rating and as a minimum any counterparty must have a long-term public rating of Single A from any two recognised rating agencies.
Pre-approved limits are set based on a rating matrix and exposures monitored accordingly.
The Group also employs the use of set-off rights in some agreements.
26 h Capital risk The Group defines capital as equity, debt capital market issuance, loans and borrowings note 22 and cash and cash equivalents note 21.
The Group does not have any externally imposed requirements for managing capital, other than those imposed by Company Law.
The Boards objective is to maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives, including but not limited to reshaping the portfolio through mergers, acquisitions and disposals.
In doing so the Board seeks to manage funding and liquidity risk, optimise shareholder return and maintain an implied investment grade credit position.
This strategy is unchanged from the prior year.
The Board reviews and approves at least annually a treasury policy document which covers, inter alia, funding and liquidity risk, capital structure and risk management.
This policy details targets for committed funding headroom, diversification of committed funding and debt maturity profile.
The Articles of Association of Serco Group plc require that the net borrowings of Serco Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings shall not at any time without the previous sanction of an ordinary resolution exceed three and a half times adjusted capital and reserves.
The Group ensures that sufficient funds and distributable reserves are held to allow payments of projected dividends to shareholders and it intends to pursue a policy of dividend growth that broadly reflects the increase in underlying earnings of the business.
Retirement benefit schemes The Group has accounted for pensions in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined benefit schemes and defined contribution schemes.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 December 2011, including the proportionate share of joint ventures, was 112.3m 2010: 106.5m.
27 a Defined benefit schemes The Group operates defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK and Europe.
In addition, the Group has interests in joint ventures, which operate defined benefit schemes for qualifying employees.
The assets of the funded schemes are held independently of the Groups assets in separate trustee administered funds.
The Groups major schemes are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit actuarial cost method.
This reflects service rendered by employees to the dates of valuation and incorporates actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits, projected rates of salary growth, and long-term expected rates of return for scheme assets.
Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-quality corporate bonds in the country concerned.
Long-term expected rates of return for scheme assets are based on published brokers forecasts for each category of scheme assets.
Pension assets and liabilities in different defined benefit schemes are not offset unless the Group has a legally enforceable right to use the surplus in one scheme to settle obligations in the other scheme and intends to exercise this right.

Retirement benefit schemes continued 27 a Defined benefit schemes continued i Balance sheet values The amounts recognised in the balance sheet are grouped together as follows: Contract specific Virtually certain costs reimbursed The Group has an obligation to contribute to the pension scheme over the term of the contract.
At rebid, any deficit or surplus would transfer to the next contractor.
Throughout the contract, it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed the expenditure required to settle the defined benefit obligation.
The Groups share of the defined benefit obligation less its share of the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contract has been recognised as a liability.
The Group has recognised the right to reimbursement as a separate asset.
In the income statement, the expense relating to this defined benefit scheme has been presented net of the amount recognised for the reimbursement, resulting in a nil charge to the income statement.
Contract specific Not certain costs reimbursed These are pre-funded defined benefit schemes.
The Group has obligations to contribute variable amounts to the pension schemes over the terms of the related contracts.
The Group has recognised as a liability the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of scheme assets that it will fund over the period of the contracts with a corresponding amount recognised as intangible assets at the start of the contracts.
Subsequent actuarial gains and losses in relation to the Groups share of the pension obligations have been recognised in the SOCI.
The intangible assets are amortised over the term of the contracts.
Non contract specific These consist of a pre-funded defined benefit scheme which does not relate to any specific contract the funding policy is to contribute such variable amounts, on the advice of the actuary, as will achieve 100% funding on a projected salary basis and an unfunded defined benefit scheme, both of which do not relate to any specific contract.
Any liabilities arising are recognised in full.
ii Triennial funding valuation Among our non contract specific schemes, the largest is the Serco Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SPLAS.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of this scheme was undertaken as at 6 April 2009 and resulted in an actuarially assessed deficit of 141m.
Following this review, the Group agreed with the Trustees to make cash contributions of 30% of members pensionable salaries until 2019, plus lump sum payments of 20m, which was paid in December 2010 and 40m, which was paid in January 2011.
The Group continues to review the level of benefits and contributions under the scheme in light of our business needs and changes to pension legislation.

Certain of the Groups non contract specific schemes have a Liability Driven Investment LDI strategy which aims to reduce volatility risk by better matching assets to liabilities.
The main asset classes that make up the LDI investments are gilts and corporate bonds with inflation and interest swap overlays.
The assumed expected rate of return is taken to be gilts 0.8% 2010: gilts 0.7%.
In some schemes, employee contributions vary over time to meet a specified proportion of the overall costs, including a proportion of any deficit.
The liabilities recognised in the balance sheet for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
In addition, the amounts charged to the income statement for these schemes are net of the proportion attributed to employees.
The amounts attributed to employees are shown separately in the reconciliation of changes in the fair value of scheme assets and liabilities.

Assumptions in respect of the expected return on scheme assets are based on market expectations of returns over the life of the related obligation.
Due consideration has been given to current market conditions as at 31 December 2011 in respect to inflation, interest, bond yields and equity performance when selecting the expected return on assets assumptions.
The expected yield on bond investments with fixed interest rates is derived from their market value.
The yield on equity investments contains an additional premium an equity risk premium to compensate investors for the additional anticipated risks of holding this type of investment, when compared to bond yields.
Management have concluded that an appropriate equity risk premium is 4.6% 2010: 4.1%.
The overall expected return on assets is calculated as the weighted average of the expected returns for the principal asset categories held by scheme.
Cumulative actuarial gains recognised since 1 January 2004 are 23.5m 2010: losses of 42.0m.
