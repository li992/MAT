co. uk annualreport11 Annual report and financial statements 2011 88 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 52 weeks ended 30 January 2011 29 Contingent liabilities In April 2010, the Office of Fair Trading OFT confirmed that it has dropped the allegations against Morrisons in relation to its ongoing Dairy Products investigation.
Morrisons had always believed strongly that it had no case to answer, and therefore the OFTs decision to drop all allegations against Morrisons was a welcome vindication of Morrisons position.
At the same time, the OFT confirmed that of the four allegations it had originally made against the Companys subsidiary company, Safeway Limited, two were also being dropped.
The OFTs investigation is expected to conclude in the first half of 2011.
Additionally, the OFT issued a decision that the Group was engaged in unlawful practices in relation to retail prices for tobacco products in the UK.
The Board considers the OFTs stance to be illogical and without foundation and expects that when the case is considered with proper judicial scrutiny by the Competition Appeals Tribunal, it will be overturned.
The Board has not made a provision for such a liability.

The total cash consideration for the purchase was 70m.
Due to the limited time available between the acquisition and the approval of these financial statements, the Group is still in the process of establishing the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired.
The net book value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed was 12m.
On 9 March 2011, the Group made a 32m investment to acquire a c10% stake in FreshDirect, an internet grocer serving the New York market.
b Borrowings On 4 March 2011, the Group concluded a renewal of its revolving finance facility.
The new facility will be provided by a syndicate of 8 banks, and will give the Group access to funding of 1,200m for a period of 5 years from the date of signing.

The principal area of trading for all the above companies is the United Kingdom apart from Bos Brothers Fruit and Vegetables BV and Safeway Overseas Limited who also trade in the rest of Europe.
The Group currently owns 51% of the share capital of Farmers Boy Deeside Limited.
However, due to the nature of options in place to purchase the remaining 49% share capital in 2013, the subsidiary has been treated as if it were already 100% owned for accounting purposes.
The Company is also part of a Joint Venture, with The Great Steward of Scotland Dumfries House Trust, to form The Morrisons Farm at Dumfries House Limited, whose principal activity is to farm 859 acres of agricultural land located on the Dumfries House Estate near Cumnock in Ayrshire, Scotland.
This has been accounted for as a Joint Venture in accordance with IFRS, however, as the results are not material to the Group, no further disclosure has been made of the accounting policies within the consolidated financial statements.
In addition to the above, the Company has a number of other subsidiary companies, particulars of which will be annexed to the next annual return.
