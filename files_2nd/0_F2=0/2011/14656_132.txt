Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 20 August 2011 1.
Accounting policies continued On 30 June 2011 the Punch Taverns plc group was reorganised such that all of the Spirit Pub Company businesses were acquired by Spirit Pub Company Holdco Limited.
On the same date, it was agreed that certain tax reliefs and allowable capital losses would be reallocated between various members of the Spirit Group and the Punch Taverns group and on 5 July 2011 an amount of 12 million cash was transferred in respect of that allocation to the Spirit Group.
On 1 July 2011, an amount of 61 million cash was transferred to the Spirit Group by the Punch Taverns group as part of the cash allocation agreed prior to demerger.
Prior to the demerger, the Punch Taverns plc group undertook a group reorganisation resulting in intercompany debt being written down to market value and resulting in a 1,533 million capital contribution being recognised in the accounts.
At the date of the demerger, Spirit Pub Company plc acquired the entire issued share capital of Spirit Pub Company Holdco Limited in return for issuing shares to shareholders in Punch Taverns plc.
The formation of a new holding company, Spirit Pub Company plc, prior to demerger was not a business combination involving a third party and, as such, the financial statements of Spirit Pub Company plc have been presented as a continuation of the Spirit Pub Company Holdco group.
To do so, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting in IFRS 3 have been applied.
