Capital policy The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide optimal returns for shareholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In doing so the Groups strategy is to maintain a capital structure commensurate with an investment grade credit rating and to retain appropriate levels of liquidity headroom to ensure financial stability and flexibility.
To achieve this strategy the Group regularly monitors key credit metrics such as the gearing ratio, cash flow to net debt see note 29 and fixed charge cover to maintain this position.
In addition the Group ensures a combination of appropriate committed short-term liquidity headroom with a diverse and balanced longterm debt maturity profile.
As at the balance sheet date the Groups average debt maturity profile was nine years last year ten years.
During the year the Group maintained an investment grade credit rating of Baa3 stable with Moodys and BBBstable with Standard & Poors.
In order to maintain or realign the capital structure, the Group may adjust the number of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
