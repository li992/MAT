General reserve also includes US$44.3 million of debenture redemption reserve.
2 Under Indian law, a general reserve is created through an annual transfer of net income at a specified percentage in accordance with applicable regulations.
The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that if a dividend distribution in a given year is more than 10.0% of the paid-up capital of the Company for that year, then the total dividend distribution is less than the total distributable results for that year.
The transfer is to reflect the general reserve at the cumulative amount attributable to the equity holders of the parent, offset by the current period transfer of US$596.0 million.
3 Includes buy back of US$66.4 million made by an independent company Gorey Investments Ltd. funded by a wholly owned subsidiary of Vedanta.
4 This relates to the recognition of the equity component of the US$883 million convertible bond on the removal of the cash settlement option on 28 July 2010.
5 In June 2009, Sterlite raised US$1090.1 million via the issuance of American Depository Receipts.
This resulted in a reduction of Vedantas shareholding in Sterlite from 61.35% to 56.62%.
This reduction has not resulted in any change in control and hence Sterlite continues to be consolidated in Vedantas consolidated financial statements.
This reduction has been accounted in Vedantas consolidated financial statement as an equity transaction.
The carrying amount of the minority interest has been adjusted to reflect the change in Vedantas interest in Sterlites net assets.
The difference between the amount by which the minority interest is adjusted and the net consideration received of US$298.2 million is recognised directly in equity and attributed to equity holders of Vedanta.
