Due to the volume Following the success of the 2011 of stripping work conducted during exploration programme, which Alluvial mining is a simple, was 89,600oz equating to 2011, the backlog of stripping resulted in a signi cant increase in very well-established and approximately 14% of the accumulated at the end of 2010 non-refractory reserves at the proven low-risk technology that Groups overall gold production was fully cleared.

This share is forward the expansion of Pioneers for many decades.
It involves expected to decrease with the The increase in production at production capacity to Q3 2012, the removal of overburden increase of production from Pioneer also re ects the scheduled with the commissioning of a fourth using conventional truck-andhard-rock deposits.

It is planned that Pioneers overall design capacity, no added chemicals and also heap-leach operations will be including its heap-leaching facility does not require blasting or rock Typically alluvial operations carry signi cantly expanded in 2012, to 8,000Ktpa.
At many operations, higher production costs as they processing about 1.4Mtpa of ore. the Group is reworking sites are heavily reliant on diesel and The 2012 production target at previously developed during process lower grade material.
The Board is pleased to report Pioneer is 286,000oz, re ecting the Soviet times, re-processing In spite of this, production from that management restructuring scheduled processing of lower material that was historically mined alluvial deposits in the current at Pioneer completed in 2011 grade material.
However, this target at these sites thereby reducing its high gold price environment has resulted in a signi cant does not fully include the planned environmental footprint.

Alluvial production is seasonal, 2011 total cash costs for the The current reserves of nonoccurring during the warmer Groups alluvial operations were Costs refractory material at the project months of the year usually US$1,167 oz 36% higher than Total cash costs at Pioneer are expected to support production from May to November.
This gure decreased by 3% in 2011 to until 2016.
It is anticipated that the Preparations for the production was broadly in line with US$530 oz compared with processing of refractory ore will season are typically made in expectations, as alluvial mining US$549 oz in 2010, despite commence in 2015 following the winter when the team outlines typically requires more costly on-going pressure from input installation of a otation unit at the areas of workings and makes overheads than hard-rock costs, in ation and a strong Pioneer.
