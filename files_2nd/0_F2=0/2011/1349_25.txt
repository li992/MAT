Figures for 2004 and prior are reported under UK GAAP and have not been restated in accordance with IFRS.
Before exceptional items, amortisation and fair value remeasurements.
EBITDA, operating profit and pre-tax profit loss are stated before exceptional items but have been adjusted to allocate the impact of the US accounting issues and the change in self-insurance estimation method reported in 2003 to the years to which they relate and to reflect the BET USA lease adjustment reported in 2002 in 2001.
The directors believe these adjustments improve comparability between periods.
Shareholders funds for the years up to 30 April 2003 were restated in 2003 4 to reflect shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Trust as a deduction from shareholders funds in accordance with UITF 38.
