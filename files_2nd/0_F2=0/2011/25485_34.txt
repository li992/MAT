344 Derivative financial instruments have been classi ed as held-for-trading and include derivatives held as hedges.
Reclassifi cations of fi financial instruments During the 2009 year the group reclassi ed certain financial instruments out of fair value through pro t or loss.
These assets were originally classi ed as held-for-trading but the groups intentions in regard to these assets changed and the group reclassi ed 112.3 million and 7.8 million to the loans and receivables and available-for-sale classi cations respectively.
The amount reclassi ed re ected the fair value of the financial assets at the date of reclassi cation.
At the time of the transfers, the group identi ed the rare circumstances permitting such reclassi cations, being severe liquidity in the relevant markets.
The group did not undertake any further reclassi cations under the amendment to IAS 39 in the current year.
The following table shows carrying values and fair values of the assets reclassi ed: Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value as at as at as at as at 31 March 31 March 31 March 31 March 000 2011 2011 2010 2010 Trading assets reclassi ed to loans and receivables 55 232 32 922 96 383 86 870 55 232 32 922 96 383 86 870 If the reclassi cations had not been made, the groups income before tax in 2011 would have reduced by 12.4 million 2010: a reduction of 5.1 million.
In the current year the reclassi ed assets have contributed 0.2 million to income through the margin line and a loss of 15.3 million through impairments.
In 2010, the reclassi ed assets contributed 2.6 million to net interest income and a loss of 7.8 million through impairments.
As at the date of reclassi cation the effective interest rate on reclassi ed trading assets ranged from 4.61% to 18.29%.
Fair value hierarchy IFRS 7 requires that an entity disclose for each class of financial instruments measured at fair value the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurements are categorised in their entirety.
The fair value hierarchy re ects the signi cance of the inputs used in making fair value measurements.
The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorised in its entirety shall be determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is signi cant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The fair value hierarchy has the following levels: Level 1 quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Assets and liabilities related to the long-term assurance business attributable to policyholders have been excluded from the analysis as the change in fair value of related assets is attributable to policyholders.

Instruments were transferred from level 1 to level 2 due to reduced market observability.
There were no transfers between level 1 and level 2 for the year ended 31 March 2011.

The paragraphs below describe the methodologies and assumptions used to determine fair values for those financial instruments which are not already recorded at fair value in the financial statements.
Financial instruments for which fair value approximates carrying value For financial assets and financial liabilities that are liquid or have a short-term maturity less than three months it is assumed that the carrying amounts approximate their fair value.
This assumption also applies to demand deposits, savings accounts without a speci c maturity and variable rate financial instruments.
Fixed rate fi financial instruments The fair value of xed rate financial assets and financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by comparing spreads earned on the transactions with spreads earned on similar new transactions entered into by the group.
The estimated fair value of xed interest bearing deposits is based on discounted cash ows, using prevailing money market interest rates for debts with similar credit risk and maturity.
For quoted sub-debt issued, the fair values are calculated based on quoted market prices.
For those notes issued where quoted market prices are not available, a discounted cash ow model is used based on a current interest rate yield curve appropriate for the remaining term to maturity.
Certain financial instruments, that would normally be carried at fair value, continue to be recognised at transaction price.
This occurs when the fair value would normally be determined using valuation techniques which cannot be relied on due to insuf cient external inputs.
This results in gains or losses which have not been recognised on balance sheet.

Derivative fi financial instruments Derivatives The group enters into various contracts for derivatives both as principal for trading purposes and as customer for hedging foreign exchange and interest rate exposures.
These include financial futures, options, swaps and forward rate agreements.
The risks associated with derivative instruments are monitored in the same manner as for the underlying instruments.
Risks are also measured across the product range in order to take into account possible correlations.
In the tables that follow notional principal amounts indicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk.
The fair value of a derivative financial instrument represents the positive or negative cash ows which would have occurred had the rights and obligations arising from that instrument been closed out by the group in an orderly market transaction at balance sheet date.

Goodwill continued Goodwill is tested annually for impairment, or more frequently if evidence exists that goodwill might be impaired, by comparing the carrying value to its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on expected cash ows within the cash generating units of the group to which the goodwill is allocated.
Key assumptions within the calculation include discount rates, growth rates in revenue and related expenditure.
Discount rates are based on pre-tax rates that re ect current market conditions, adjusted for the speci c risks associated with the cash-generating unit.
Growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
Cash ow forecasts are based on the most recent financial budgets for the next financial year and are extrapolated for a period of three to five years, adjusted for expected future events.
UK, Europe and Australia The three most signi cant cash-generating units giving rise to goodwill are Investec Asset Management, Kensington and Rensburg Sheppards plc.
For Investec Asset Management, the recoverability of goodwill of 88.0 million has been tested with reference to both the underlying pro tability taking into account 2011 pro ts before taxation of 53 million 2010: 25.3 million and budgets and plans for the next three years and the value of the business as represented by funds under management of 30.8 billion 2010: 21.7 billion.
These factors support the carrying value of goodwill.
Goodwill of 121.1 million arising on the acquisition of Kensington on 7 August 2008 was written down by 59.9 million at 31 March 2008 to 61.2 million following the managed reduction in business volumes and limited activity in securitisation markets.
At 31 March 2011, the remaining goodwill has been tested for impairment on the basis of the existing book, assuming no new mortgage origination and no recovery in securitisation markets.
Cash ows have been projected for a five year period using the latest available information on debts and expected repayments discounted at 11%.
On this basis goodwill is above book value.
Future impairment of this goodwill will largely be dependent on the timing of future repayments and the level of future business generated.
The goodwill of 197.1 million within Wealth and Investment relates to the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc arising from the current year acquisition refer to note 29.
South Africa The majority of goodwill attributed to the South African operations relate to Investec Asset Management, particularly to the businesses from the Fedsure acquisition, which have been identi ed as a separate cash-generating unit.
The goodwill relating to Fedsure has been tested for impairment, taking into account pro tability, being the current year pro ts and the budgeted pro ts and funds under management.
The discount rate applied of 12.8% is determined using the South African risk-free rate adjusted for the risk related to the cash-generating unit.
An impairment of 6.9 million 2010: 3.5 million was recognised in the current year on this goodwill.
Movement in goodwill 2011 Goodwill arising from acquisitions includes 198.5 million on the acquisition of Rensburg Sheppards plc which is set out in note 29.
The reduction in goodwill relates to the sale and deconsolidation of investments previously consolidated as subsidiaries together with the sale of Rensburg Fund Management Limited.
2010 Goodwill arising from acquisitions includes 8.5 million on the acquisition of 75% of Leasedirect Finance Limited and 1.0 million on the acquisition of the remaining minority holding 24.51% in Investec Asset Management Namibia Pty Ltd refer to note 29.
Income statement movement As detailed above, the 2011 income statement of 6.9 million 2010: 3.5 million of goodwill impairments were recognised in relation to goodwill arising from the Fedsure acquisition.

The group makes awards available to staff members via the underlying share trusts.
The particular instrument used varies from time to time depending on taxation legislation and factors affecting the group structure.
Nevertheless, whatever the instrument chosen, its underlying value depends solely on the performance of the groups share price.
At present, the practice of the group is to give all permanent staff members a share allocation based on their annual package after completing six months of employment.
In line with the objective of providing a long-term incentive for staff these share awards vest over periods varying from five to eight years.
After the initial allocation referred to above, additional allocations are made to staff members at the discretion of group management and depending on the individual performance and contribution made by the respective staff members.
The extent of the directors and staff interest in the incentive schemes is detailed on page 271.

Financial Services Compensation Scheme The UK Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS provides compensation to customers of UK authorised financial institutions in the event that an institution which is a participating member of the FSCS is unable, or is likely to be unable, to pay claims against it.
The FSCS raises annual levies from participating members to meet its management expenses and compensation costs.
Individual participating members make payments based on their level of participation in the case of deposits, the proportion that their protected deposits represent of total protected deposits at 31 December each year.
If an institution is a participating member on this date it is obligated to pay a levy imposed in the immediately following levy period which runs from 1 April to 31 March.
The FSCS has borrowed from HM Treasury to fund the compensation costs associated with Bradford & Bingley, Heritable Bank, Kaupthing Singer & Friedlander, Landsbanki Icesave and London Scottish Bank plc.
These borrowings are on an interest-only basis until September 2011.
Investec Bank plc is a participating member of the FSCS and the bank has accrued 2 million for its share of levies that will be raised by the FSCS, including the interest on the loan from HM Treasury, in respect of the two levy years to 31 March 2011.
The accrual is based on estimates for the interest the FSCS will pay on the loan and estimates of the level of the banks market participation in the relevant periods.
Interest will continue to accrue to the FSCS on the HM Treasury loan and will form part of future FSCS levies.
If the remaining available assets of the defaulting institutions are insuf cient to allow the FSCS to repay the HM Treasury loan when due, the FSCS will agree a schedule of repayments of any remaining principal outstanding with HM Treasury, which will be recouped from the industry in the form of additional levies.
At the date of these financial statements, it is not possible to estimate whether there will ultimately be additional levies on the industry, the level of Investecs market participation or other factors that may affect the amounts or timing of amounts that may ultimately become payable, nor the effect that such levies may have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
Legal proceedings Investec operates in a legal and regulatory environment that exposes it to litigation risks.
As a result, Investec is involved in disputes and legal proceedings which arise in the ordinary course of business.
Investec does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of the proceedings to which Investec is party to have a signi cant adverse effect on the financial position of the group.

Hedges The group uses derivatives for the management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with nontrading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the Central Treasury in the Capital Markets business.
Once aggregated and netted Treasury as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages, the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and nontrading interest rate risk within fide ned parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependant on the classi cation between fair value hedges and cash ow hedges and in particular accounting hedges require the identi cation of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of xed rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.
Hedges continued Cash fl ow hedges The group is exposed to variability in cash ows on future liabilities arising from changes in base interest rates.
