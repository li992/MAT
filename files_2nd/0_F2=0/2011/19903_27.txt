Notes to the financial statements Section 1: Basis of preparation This section lays out the Groups accounting policies that relate to the financial statements as a whole.
Where an accounting policy is specific to a particular note to the financial statements, the policy is described in the note to which it relates and has been clearly identified in a box.
The financial statements consolidate those of The UNITE Group plc, the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interests in jointly controlled entities.
The parent company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not as a group.
Both the parent company financial statements and the group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRS.
On publishing the parent company financial statements here together with the group financial statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income statement and related notes.
The accounting policies have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The Company is domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Going concern The Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development and position are set on in the Business Review on pages 18 to 31.
In addition, section 4 of these Notes to the financial statements includes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: details of its borrowings and interest rate swaps: and in note 5.3 its exposure to credit risk.
The Group has prepared cash flow projections with appropriate sensitivities until the end of 2013.
The group has borrowing facilities expiring in 2012 and 2013, but it has already refinanced one of these facilities for a further three years and is making good progress with another new facility.
While the Group will continue to extend future debt maturities, it expects to have sufficient headroom in existing banking facilities and its forecast cash balances to repay any facilities expiring and to meet its funding requirements until at least the end of 2013, while remaining within its banking covenants.
The Group is in full compliance with its borrowing covenants at 31 December 2011 as set out in note 4.5c.
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
The financial statements have therefore been prepared on a going concern basis.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment property, interest rate swaps and land and buildings included in property, plant and equipment all of which are stated at their fair value.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Company.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an enterprise so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are presently exercisable are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intra-group transactions, such as property disposals and management fees are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with joint ventures are eliminated to the extent of the Groups retained interest in the entity.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains except where the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment in value of fixed assets.
Impact of accounting standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became effective for the year ended 31 December 2011, but none of these had a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
The Group has not adopted early any standard, amendment or interpretation.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been announced but are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2011.
None of these are expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
72 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Section 1: Basis of preparation continued Accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Groups accounting policies.
It also requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis with revisions recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected.
The areas involving a higher degree of judgement of complexity are set out below and are explained in more detail in the related notes to the financial statements.
The accounting policy descriptions set out the areas where judgement needs exercising, the most significant of which are as follows: classification of properties note 3.1 classification of joint venture vehicles note 3.4 The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out below and in more detail in the related notes: valuation of investment property, completed property and properties under development note 3.1 onerous contract provisions note 2.5 taxation note 2.6 valuation of interest rate swaps note 4.2 impairment of trade receivables note 5.2 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 73 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year This section focuses on the results and performance of the Group.
On the following pages you will find disclosures explaining the Groups results for the year, segmental information, taxation, earnings and net asset value NAV per share.
Net portfolio contribution NPC and NAV movement are the Groups main key performance indicators.
This reflects the way the business is managed and how the directors assess the performance of the Group.
Revenue The Group earns revenue from the following activities: 2011 2010 Note m m Rental income Operations segment 2.2a 63.6 63.5 Property sales Property segment 8.2 111.9 Manufacturing revenue Property segment 11.4 7.2 Management fees Operations segment 2.2a 10.6 8.9 Management fees Property segment 1.3 2.1 95.1 193.6 Impact of minority interest on management fees 0.2 0.2 Total revenue 94.9 193.4 Revenue has reduced to 94.9 million 2010: 193.4 million due to a planned reduction in the volume of property sales to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund USAF.
Revenue from property sales includes nil 2010: 103.5 million to USAF, a joint venture, and represents 0% 2010: 54% of total revenue.
Accounting policies Revenue is recognised on the following bases: Rental income Rental income from property leased out under operating leases comprising direct lets to students and leases to Universities and commercial tenants is recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives are sometimes granted on commercial units, these are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income and spread over the term of the lease.
Property sales Income relating to the sale of trading properties is recognised once contracts for sale have been unconditionally exchanged.
Manufacturing revenue Revenue from the sale of modules and related services is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
For modules this is on receipt of customer acceptance following manufacture and for related services as the service is provided.
Management and promote fees Management and promote fees are recognised, in line with the management contracts, in the period to which they relate as services are provided.
The Group can earn promote fees relative to criteria specified in the joint venture agreements.
74 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.2 Segmental information The Board of Directors monitor the business along two activity lines.
The reportable segments for the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are Operations and Property in prior years, the same segments were referred to as Investment and Development, however the names have been changed in the current year to be consistent with the Groups new internal terminology.
The Group undertakes its Operations and Property activities directly and through joint ventures with third parties.
The joint ventures are an integral part of each segment and are included in the information used by the Board to monitor the business.
The Groups properties are located exclusively in the United Kingdom.
The Board therefore does not consider that the Group has meaningful geographical segments.
a Operations Segment result The Operations Segment manages rental properties, owned directly by the Group or by joint ventures.
Its revenues are derived from rental income and asset management fees earned from joint ventures.
NPC is the key indicator which is used by the Board to manage the Operations business.
As these properties contribute to the Groups rental income, the Group consider these lease costs to be a form of financing.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 75 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.2 Segmental information continued b Property Segment result The Groups Property Segment undertakes the acquisition and development of properties.
This includes the manufacture and sale of modular building components, through UNITE Modular Solutions Limited, UMS.
The Property Segments revenue predominantly comprises the sales proceeds from properties, including those sold to the UNITE UK Student Accommodation Fund: revenue from the sale of modules to third parties and joint ventures, and development management fees earned from joint ventures.
2011 2010 m m Pre-contract and abortive costs 3.2 3.2 Property disposals and write downs 1.3 4.0 Other 0.1 0.2 Property segment result pre UMS losses 2.0 0.6 UMS losses 21.0 4.8 Property segment result 23.0 4.2 The property segment derives its revenue from property sales, manufacturing revenue and management fees as set out in note 2.1.
The UMS loss in 2011 includes trading losses of 5.5 million together with a provision of 5.6 million for completing loss making contracts in 2012: provisions for onerous leases of 5.4 million: and impairment of other fixed assets of 3.7 million and inventory of 0.8 million.
c Segmental contribution to NAV The Board does not use balance sheet information split out by segment to monitor and manage the Groups activities.
Instead the position of the Group is managed by reviewing the increases in Adjusted NAV contributed by each segment during the period.
Contributions to Adjusted NAV by each segment during the year is as follows: 2011 2010 Note m m Operations Net portfolio contribution 2.2a 11.0 4.1 Property Rental growth 22.9 19.3 Yield movement 14.6 Disposals and acquisition costs 0.6 5.4 Capital expenditure and refurbishments 0.4 Rental property gains 23.5 28.1 Development property gains 33.3 27.5 56.8 55.6 UMS 21.0 4.8 Pre-contract and other development costs 3.4 3.5 Total property 32.4 47.3 Unallocated 3.4 0.1 Total adjusted NAV movement in the period 40.0 51.5 Total adjusted NAV brought forward 474.5 423.0 Total adjusted NAV carried forward 2.4a 514.5 474.5 The unallocated amount includes restructuring costs of 1.6 million 2010: nil, dividends of 0.8 million 2010: nil, current tax charges of 0.4 million 2010: credit 1.0 million and the share of joint venture swap losses of 0.5 million 2010: 0.7 million.
76 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.3 Adjusted profit and EPS In addition to the IFRS reporting measures, the Group reports adjusted profit on the basis recommended for real estate companies by EPRA, the European Public Real Estate Association.
EPRA recommends that real estate investment companies exclude development profits and profits from disposal of assets as they are one off in nature, however the development of properties for future sale is an on-going business activity for the Group and therefore results of this core activity are included in the adjusted result through the Property Segment result.
a Adjusted profit and reconciliation to IFRS The adjusted profit loss excludes movements relating to changes in values of investment properties and interest rate swaps, which are included in the profit reported under IFRS.
The adjusted profit loss reconciles to the profit reported under IFRS as follows: 2011 2010 Note m m Operations segment result Net portfolio contribution 2.2a 11.0 4.1 Property segment result pre UMS losses 2.2b 2.0 0.6 Unallocated to segments 3.6 0.4 Adjusted profit pre UMS losses 5.4 4.3 UMS losses 21.0 4.8 2.2b Adjusted loss 15.6 0.5 Net valuation gains on investment property 3.1 7.7 15.4 Share of joint venture gains on investment property 3.4b 10.7 18.1 Mark to market changes in interest rate swaps 4.3 10.6 18.6 Interest rate swap payments on ineffective hedges 10.2 10.9 Share of joint venture changes in fair value of interest rate swaps 3.4b 0.4 0.3 Current tax included in unallocated to segments 0.4 1.0 Share of joint venture deferred tax credit charge 3.4b 0.3 0.5 Minority interest share of NPC 3.4b 1.2 1.0 Minority interest share of property segment result 0.3 Profit before tax 4.7 24.2 The adjusted loss for 2010 has been restated to include losses on disposal of investment property of 2.9 million, which had been previously excluded, so that all property disposals are included in adjusted loss.
Within IFRS reported profit, there is a 10.6 million loss 2010: 18.6 million loss relating to movements in the mark to market of ineffective interest rate swaps, this full loss can be seen in note 4.3.
Part of this movement, 10.2 million 2010: 10.9 million relates to actual interest payments made on these swaps and is considered to be a true operating cost of the Operations Segment.
It is therefore already included within Net Financing Costs in NPC Operating Segment result in note 2.2a.
The minority interest share, or non-controlling interest, arises as a result of the Company not owning 100% of the share capital of one of its subsidiaries, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd. More detail is provided in note 3.4.
Unallocated to segments includes restructuring costs of 1.6 million 2010: nil, current tax charges of 0.4 million 2010: credit 1.0 million and share option fair value charges of 1.2 million 2010: 1.3 million.
b EPS and Adjusted EPS EPS is the amount of post-tax profits attributable to each share.
Basic EPS is adjusted in order to more accurately show the business performance of the Group in a consistent manner and to reflect how the business is managed and measured on a day to day basis.
Adjusted EPS is calculated using adjusted loss as set out above.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 77 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.3 Adjusted profit and EPS continued The calculations of basic and adjusted EPS for the year ended 31 December 2011 is as follows: 2011 2010 Note m m Earnings Basic and diluted 2.1 19.6 Adjusted 2.3a 15.6 0.5 Adjusted pre UMS losses 2.3a 5.4 4.3 Weighted average number of shares thousands Basic 160,271 160,074 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 39 81 Diluted 160,310 160,155 Earnings per share pence Basic 1.3p 12.2p Diluted 1.3p 12.2p Adjusted 9.7p 0.3p Adjusted pre-UMS result 3.4p 2.7p Movements in the weighted average number of shares have resulted from the issue of shares arising from the employee share based payment schemes.
In addition to the potential dilutive ordinary shares share options shown above, there were a further 29,000 share options in existence at 31 December 2011 2010: 794,000 which are excluded from this calculation because they would increase EPS they are anti-dilutive.
Also excluded from the potential dilutive shares share options are 1,460,000 options in existence at 31 December 2011 2010: nil which are subject to conditions that have not yet been met.
2.4 Adjusted Net Assets and NAV per share Adjusted NAV as recommended by EPRA excludes the mark to market valuation of swaps, deferred tax liabilities and recognises all properties at market value.
This is the key performance measure that the Board uses to monitor and manage the position of the segments.

Provision has been made for forecast unavoidable losses on existing trading contracts of 5.6 million, all expected to be realised in 2012.
The decision to cease trading at UMS also resulted in future lease payments and associated costs becoming onerous.
Discounted future payments of 5.4 million relating primarily to the lease of the factory site have been provided in respect of these leases of which 4.7 million is not expected to be realised until between 2013 and 2017 and is therefore disclosed as due after one year.
Future payments have been discounted using a market rate of 5%.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 79 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 2: Results for the year continued 2.6 Tax The Group has not paid any corporation tax in the recent past due to the availability of capital allowances, indexation and brought forward losses.
However it does pay UK income tax on rental income that arises from investments held by offshore subsidiaries predominantly the investments in USAF.
The preparation of the tax charge in the financial statements requires the Directors to make significant judgements around the outcome of challenges by HMRC to the tax treatment of certain of the Groups activities: where appropriate, the Directors seek advice from leading tax professionals and tax counsel in arriving at such judgements.
Accounting policies The tax charge for the period is recognised in the income statement and the statement of comprehensive income, according to the accounting treatment of the related transaction.
The tax charge comprises both current and deferred tax.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The current tax charge is based on tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted at the year end.
Deferred tax arises due to certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
Temporary differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are not provided for to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax provision in respect of property assets is calculated on the basis that assets will not be held indefinitely and therefore takes account of available indexation.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
a Tax income statement The total taxation charge credit in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2011 2010 m m Corporation tax in respect of income Income tax on UK rental income arising in non-UK companies 0.5 0.5 Adjustments for prior years 1.3 Current tax charge credit 0.5 0.8 Origination and reversal of temporary differences 0.9 2.5 Effect of change in tax rate 0.3 0.1 Adjustments for prior years 0.3 1.3 Deferred tax charge 0.3 3.7 Total tax charge in income statement 0.8 2.9 In order to understand how, in the income statement, a tax charge of 0.8 million arises on a profit before tax of 4.7 million, the taxation charge that would arise at the standard rate of UK corporation tax is reconciled to the actual tax charge as follows: 2011 2010 m m Profit before tax 4.7 24.2 Income tax using the UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% 2010: 28% 1.2 6.8 Effect of indexation on investment and development property 2.4 3.5 Non-deductible expenses 0.9 1.3 Share of joint venture profit 0.4 0.7 Movement on unprovided deferred tax asset 1.6 0.3 Profit on disposal of assets not chargeable to tax 0.1 Effect of property disposals to USAF 0.4 0.6 Adjustments for prior years deferred tax 0.3 1.3 Adjustments for prior years current tax 1.3 Rate difference on deferred tax 0.3 0.1 Total tax charge in the income statement 0.8 2.9 b Tax other comprehensive income Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling 0.4 million 2010: 3.7 million has been recognised representing deferred tax.
An analysis of this is included below in the deferred tax movement table.

Company Deferred tax has not been recognised on temporary timing differences of 12.2 million 2010: 12.1 million in respect of revaluation of subsidiaries and investment in joint ventures as it is probable that the temporary timing difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
2.7 Audit fees Disclosures in respect of fees paid to the auditors can be found in the Audit Committee Report, page 50.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 81 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 3: Asset management The Group holds its property portfolio directly and through its joint ventures.
The performance of the property portfolio whether wholly owned or in joint ventures is the key factor that drives adjusted net asset value NAV, one of the Groups key performance indicators.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups investments in property assets and joint ventures and their performance over the year.
3.1 Wholly owned property assets The Groups wholly owned property portfolio is held in three groups on the balance sheet at the carrying values detailed below.
In the Groups adjusted NAV, all these groups are shown at market value.
i Investment property fixed assets These are assets that were acquired by the Group with the intention to hold the assets for a long period to earn rental income or capital appreciation, prior to establishing The UNITE UK Student Accommodation USAF.
The assets are held at fair value in the balance sheet with changes in fair value taken to the income statement.
ii Completed properties current assets Following the establishment of USAF in 2006, the Group is required to offer all completed properties which meet certain performance criteria for sale to USAF, and USAF may be required to purchase assets which meet certain conditions.
Therefore, all properties constructed and completed after 2006 are held as completed properties in current assets, because these may be sold to USAF.
The Group continues to earn rental income and capital appreciation on these assets which are held at cost in the balance sheet.
iii Properties under development current assets These are assets which are currently in the course of construction and which will be transferred to Completed properties on completion.
The Group also acquires land which it intends to develop.
Land is held within inventories until planning permission is obtained, at which point it is transferred to properties under development.
The property portfolio is valued every six months by external, independent valuers, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification.
The fair values are based on market values as defined in the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual, issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arms length transaction where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
CB Richard Ellis Ltd, Jones Lang LaSalle Ltd and Messrs Knight Frank, Chartered Surveyors were the external valuers in the years ending 31 December 2011 and 2010.
Accounting policies Properties held under operating leases are not included in assets, but the future payments due in respect of these properties are disclosed in note 4.6a.
Investment properties are held at fair value.
Completed properties, properties under development and inventories are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
All costs directly associated with the purchase and construction of a property, and all subsequent qualifying expenditure is capitalised.
The recognition of acquisitions and disposals of investment and other property occurs on unconditional exchange of contracts.
Borrowing costs are capitalised if they are directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of a property asset.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset are in progress and expenditures and borrowing costs are being incurred.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs continues until the assets are substantially ready for their intended use but stops if development activities are suspended.
If the resulting carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
The capitalisation rate is arrived at by reference to the actual rate payable on borrowings for development purposes or, with regard to that part of the development cost financed out of general borrowings, to the average rate.
During the year the average capitalisation rate used was 6.7% 2010: 7.0%.
The valuations are based on assumptions made by considering the aggregate of the net annual rents receivable and associated costs.
Valuations reflect, where appropriate, the type of tenants actually in occupation or responsible for meeting lease commitments or likely to be in occupation after letting of vacant accommodation and the markets general perception of their credit worthiness: the allocation of maintenance and insurance responsibilities between lessor and lessee: and the remaining economic life of the property.

Land and buildings are stated at fair value on the same basis as investment properties.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Leasehold improvements Shorter life of lease and economic life Other assets 4-20 years Intangible assets Intangible assets predominately comprise internally developed computer software which allows customers to book online and processes transactions within the sales cycle.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense incurred.
The assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over 4 to 5 years being the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement.

The impairment reduces the carrying value of other UMS fixed assets to their scrap value of 0.2 million.
This arises from the decision to cease trading at UMS, as disclosed in note 2.5.
UMS is a separate cash generating unit.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 85 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group Accounting policies Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The consolidated financial statements include joint ventures initially at cost subsequently increased or decreased by the Groups share of total gains and losses of joint ventures on an equity basis.
Interest free joint venture investment loans are initially recorded at fair value the difference between the nominal amount and fair value being treated as an investment in the joint venture.
The implied discount is amortised over the contracted life of the investment loan.
The Directors consider that the agreements integral to its joint ventures result in the Group having joint control: a significant degree of judgement is exercised in this assessment due to the complexity of the contractual arrangements.
The Group has four joint ventures: Groups share of Legal entity in which Joint venture assets results 2011 & 2010 Objective Partner Group has interest The UNITE UK Student 18.9% Invest and operate Consortium of investors UNITE Student Accommodation Fund student accommodation Accommodation Fund, USAF throughout the UK a Jersey Unit Trust UNITE Capital Cities 30% Develop and operate GIC Real Estate Pte, Ltd UNITE Capital Cities Unit UCC student accommodation in Trust, incorporated Real estate the capital cities of London in Jersey investment vehicle and Edinburgh of the Government of Singapore OCB Property Holdings 25% Develop and operate three Oasis Capital Bank OCB Property Holdings OCB investment properties Jersey Ltd, incorporated located in London in Jersey UNITE Student Village 51% Develop and operate Lehman Brothers LDC Project 110 Ltd, USV a student village incorporated in England located in Sheffield and Wales Part of the Groups interest is held through a subsidiary, USAF Feeder Guernsey Ltd, in which there is an external investor.
A minority interest therefore occurs on consolidation of the Groups results representing the external investors share of profits and assets relating to its investment in USAF.
The ordinary shareholders of The UNITE Group plc are beneficially interested in 16.3% 2010: 16.3% of USAF.
At 31 December 2011, the Group held a 75% interest in the ordinary shares of the joint venture, however under the articles of association the Group cannot exercise control and are only entitled to a beneficial interest of 51% of the joint ventures assets and results.
On 18 January 2012 the Group acquired the balance of the share capital in USV for 2.4 million and discharged shareholder loans amounting to 3.8 million.
The payment of these amounts is deferred until 31 October 2012.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 87 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group continued b Movement in carrying value of the Groups investments in joint ventures The carrying value of the Groups investment in joint ventures has increased by 11.4 million during the year ended 31 December 2011 2010: 13.3 million, resulting in an overall carrying value of 173.0 million 2010: 161.6 million.
The following table shows how the increase has been achieved.

These were primarily provided on the setting up of the joint venture to provide capital to acquire investment properties.
As a result of being provided interest free, the loans were discounted on recognition to reflect the fair value, the unwinding of the discount is reflected in the Groups finance income.
88 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Section 3: Asset management continued 3.4 Investments in joint ventures Group continued c Transactions with joint ventures The Group acts as asset and property manager for the joint ventures and receives management fees in relation to these services.
In addition, the Group is entitled to a promote fee from USAF if the joint venture outperforms certain benchmarks.
The Group receives additional units in USAF as consideration for the promote fee.
The Group has recognised the following management fees in its results for the year.
2011 2010 m m USAF 6.3 5.3 UCC 3.1 2.8 OCB 0.9 0.4 Property management fees 10.3 8.5 USAF 1.2 OCB 0.1 2.1 Development management fees 1.3 2.1 Total fees 11.6 10.6 During the year the Group did not sell any properties to USAF.
In 2010 the group sold five properties to USAF for 146.2 million.
105.7 million of the properties were held on the balance sheet as completed property within current assets, the proceeds and carrying value of the properties is therefore recognised in turnover and cost of sales in the income statement and the cash flows in operating activities.
The remaining 40.5 million of properties were classified as investment properties within fixed assets, the proceeds and carrying value of the properties is therefore recognised in loss on disposal of property in the income statement and the cash flows in investing activities.
UCC properties are partly funded by debt totalling 248.4 million 2010: 253.3 million which equates to 64.2% 2010: 66.7% of the market value of these properties.
The Group has guaranteed its share, 30%, of this debt amounting to 74.5 million 2010: 76.0 million.
This guarantee only takes effect in the event that the joint venture is unable to repay the debt within nine months of it becoming due.
The Group considers the likelihood of the guarantee being invoked to be remote based on the level of debt and the time frames allowed under the arrangements.
These guarantees are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 4.
3.5 Investments in subsidiaries Company Accounting policies In the financial statements of the Company, investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are carried at fair value with movements in fair value being recognised directly in equity.

90 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Section 4: Funding The Group finances its development and investment activities through a mixture of retained earnings, borrowings and equity.
The Group continuously monitors its financing arrangements to manage its gearing.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the Groups risk to fluctuations in interest rate movements.
The following pages provide disclosures about the Groups funding position, including borrowings, gearing and hedging instruments: its exposure to market risks: and its capital management policies.
4.1 Borrowings Accounting policies Interest bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interest bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
The table below analyses the Groups borrowings which comprise bank and other loans by when they fall due for payment: 2011 2010 m m Current In one year or less, or on demand 29.2 0.3 Non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 251.9 68.3 In more than two years but not more than five years 140.4 260.3 In more than five years 29.2 29.2 421.5 357.8 Total borrowings 450.7 358.1 Since the year end 78.3 million of this debt has been refinanced through an extended facility of 82.0 million expiring in 2015.
In addition to the borrowings currently drawn as shown above, the Group has available undrawn facilities of 14.3 million 2010: 39.7 million.
A further working capital facility of 20.0 million 2010: 20.0 million is also available.
A further 132 million 2010: 227 million of facilities are available if certain conditions are met.
Of this amount 30 million 2010: 44 million is only available for rental properties and 99 million 2010: 99 million for development properties.
The remaining amount is available for investment or development.
The carrying value of borrowings is considered to be approximate to fair value, except for the Groups fixed rate loans carried at 17.4 million 2010: 39.4 million.
The fair value of these fixed rate loans has been calculated by a third party expert discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates.
The fair value of these loans is 18.4 million 2010: 40.8 million.
Properties with a carrying value of 696.8 million 2010: 582.4 million have been pledged as security against the Groups borrowings.
4.2 Interest rate swaps The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
In accordance with the Groups treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue interest rate swaps for trading purposes and only holds swaps which are considered to be commercially effective.
Accounting policies Interest rate swaps are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value, with mark to market movements recognised in the income statement unless cash flow hedge accounting is applied.
Hedge accounting, as defined in IFRS, is when the interest rate swap is designated as the hedging instrument in a hedge of the variability in cash flows attributable to the interest risk of borrowings.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The Group only applies hedge accounting when the hedge is expected to be highly effective.
When a hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity with any subsequent movements in fair value taken to the income statement.
If the hedged transaction is no longer probable, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current credit worthiness of the swap counterparties.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 91 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 4: Funding continued 4.2 Interest rate swaps continued The following table shows the fair value of interest rate swaps: 2011 2010 m m Current 0.2 Non-current 39.0 37.1 Fair value of interest rate swaps 39.0 37.3 The fair values of interest rate swaps have been calculated by a third party expert, discounting estimated future cash flows on the basis of market expectations of future interest rates, representing Level 2 in the IFRS 7 fair value hierarchy.
The IFRS 7 level categorisation relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable market values.
The classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.
4.3 Net financing costs Accounting policies Net financing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable on funds invested both calculated using the effective interest rate method and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
2011 2010 Recognised in the income statement: m m Finance income Interest income on deposit 0.1 0.2 Impact of discounting on interest free joint venture investment loans note 3.4b 0.7 0.7 Finance income 0.8 0.9 Gross interest expense on loans 15.8 16.3 Interest capitalised 7.1 2.5 Loan interest and similar charges 8.7 13.8 Changes in mark to market of interest rate swaps not accounted for as hedges 10.6 18.6 Finance costs 19.3 32.4 Net financing costs 18.5 31.5 The Groups overall average cost of debt as at 31 December 2011 is 5.7% 2010: 6.9%.
The average cost of the Groups investment debt at 31 December 2011 is 5.4% 2010: 6.1%.
This excluded 27 million of swaps and associated debt which are not specifically allocated to properties, see note 4.5a i for further details.
92 The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Highlights Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Section 4: Funding continued 4.4 Gearing The Groups adjusted gearing ratio is a key indicator that the Group uses to manage its indebtness.
Adjusted net asset value NAV and adjusted net debt are used to calculate adjusted gearing.
Adjusted net debt excludes mark to market of interest rate swaps as shown below.
The Groups gearing ratios are calculated as follows: 2011 2010 Note m m Cash and cash equivalents 5.1 16.8 23.8 Current borrowings 4.1 29.2 0.3 Non-current borrowings 4.1 421.5 357.8 Interest rate swaps liabilities 4.2 39.0 37.3 Net debt per balance sheet 472.9 371.6 Mark to market of interest rate swaps 38.9 37.0 Adjusted net debt 434.0 334.6 Reported net asset value attributable to owners of the parent company 2.4c 387.6 387.5 Adjusted net asset value 2.4c 514.5 474.5 Gearing Basic Net debt Reported net asset value 122% 96% Adjusted gearing Adjusted net debt Adjusted net asset value 84% 71% See-through adjusted gearing including share of JV properties and net debt 126% 115% 4.5 Financial risk factors The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks primarily interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups treasury policy focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
Details on credit risk can be found in note 5.3. a Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by significant changes in interest rates.
Borrowings issued at or swapped to floating rates expose the Group to interest rate risk.
The Groups policy is separated into two main areas: i Development and refinancing After taking account of interest rate swaps, 36 million 89% of the Groups development borrowing at 31 December 2011 2010: 27 million 41% is fixed.
The Group will continue to review the level of its hedging in the light of the current low interest rate environment.
The Groups principal exposure to interest rate fluctuations during development relates to movements in longer term interest rates which affect the amount of debt the property income is capable of servicing at completion.
Significant adverse movements undermine the Groups ability to release equity from its developments.
The Group currently manages this risk by retaining swaps of 27 million relating to loans against properties that have been sold with the intention of allocating them against imminent new developments.
Prior to this reallocation these swaps were commercially hedging loans against rental properties.
The Groups policy also allows this exposure to be managed through the use of forward starting swaps.
The UNITE Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 93 Notes to the financial statements continued Section 4: Funding continued 4.5 Financial risk factors continued a Interest rate risk continued ii Medium and long-term finance The Group holds its medium and long-term bank finance under floating rate arrangements.
The majority of this debt is hedged through the use of interest rate swap agreements, although not all these arrangements qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
During 2011, the Groups policy guideline has been to hedge in excess of 75% of the Groups exposure for terms of approximately 2-15 years.
At 31 December 2011, after taking account of interest rate swaps, 69% 2010: 97% of the Groups medium and long-term investment borrowing was held at fixed rates.
This was temporarily below the hedging policy guideline of 75%.
New funding facilities are to be put in place in early 2012 which will require further hedging taking the hedge ratio above 75% again.
Excluding the 27 million of swaps the fixed investment borrowing is at an average rate of 5.7% 2010: 6.8% for an average period of 2 years 2010: 3 years, including these swaps the average rate is 5.4%.
The Group holds interest rate swaps at 31 December 2011 against 302.9 million 295.6 million of the Groups borrowings.
The maturity of these swaps and the applicable interest rates are as follows: 2011 2011 2010 2010 Nominal Applicable Nominal Applicable amount hedged interest rates amount hedged interest rates m % m % Within one year 5.0 4.8 Between one and two years 27.6 5.2-5.3 Between two and five years 242.5 2.8-5.8 243.5 5.2-5.8 More than five years 32.8 5.3-5.6 47.1 4.50-5.6 At 31 December 2011, if interest rates had increased decreased by 1%, pre-tax profit for the year would have been 0.8 million 2010: 0.3 million lower higher.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
For development activities, the Group has a policy to inject substantially the full amount of equity required for each development before drawing debt against the specific facility for the development.
The funding requirements of each scheme are therefore substantially ring fenced and secured at the outset of works.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and interest rate swaps into relevant maturity groupings based on the period remaining until the contractual maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash flows including interest, so will not always reconcile with the amounts disclosed on the balance sheet.

The Group monitors its covenant position and the headroom available on an ongoing basis.
At 31 December 2011, the Group was in full compliance with all of its borrowing covenants.
The Group is able to use available cash to reduce debt to increase headroom on its loan to value LTV covenants.
The covenant headroom position is outlined below and assumes that available cash is used to reduce debt.

4.6 Operating leases a Payable Accounting policies Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
Where the property interest under an operating lease is classified as an investment property, the property interest is accounted for as if it were a finance lease and the fair value model is used for the asset recognised.
