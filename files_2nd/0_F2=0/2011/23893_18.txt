Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2011 38 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has prepared its financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts SORP, issued by the Association of Investment Companies AIC in January 2009. a Basis of accounting - The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention, except for the measurement at fair value of fixed asset investments and derivative assets and liabilities, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted.
b Income - Income from equity investments is credited to the Income Statement on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
UK franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short term deposits is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash foregone, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in the capital column of the Income Statement.
Derivative income received from dividends on long Contracts For Difference CFDs, interest received on short CFDs, derivative expenses paid out as dividends on short CFDs and interest on long CFDs are included in Net income in the income column of the Income Statement.
c Special dividends - Special dividends are treated as a revenue receipt or a capital receipt depending on the facts and circumstances of each particular case.
d Expenses and finance costs - All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Finance costs are accounted for using the effective interest rate method and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
e Taxation - Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency - The Directors, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its investors operate, have determined the functional currency to be UK sterling.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in UK sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserve.
g Valuation of investments - The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy, and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors and other key management personnel.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially, and subsequently measured, at fair value, which is measured as follows: Listed investments and AIM quoted investments are valued at bid prices, or last prices, depending on the convention of the exchange on which they are listed, or otherwise at fair value based on published price quotations: Unlisted investments where there is not an active market are valued using an appropriate valuation technique so as to establish what the transaction price would have been at the balance sheet date.
In accordance with the AIC SORP the Company includes transaction costs, incidental to the purchase or sale of investments, within gains or losses on investments and has disclosed them in Note 9 on page 44.
Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2011 39 Notes to the Financial Statements h Derivative instruments - When appropriate, permitted transactions involving derivative instruments are used.
The Company may enter into futures, equity forwards, CFDs and options.
Derivatives are measured at fair value as follows: Futures and options - the quoted trade price for the contract: CFDs and equity forwards - the difference between the strike price and the bid or last price of the shares in the security that underlies the contract.
Where transactions are used to protect or enhance income, if the circumstances support this, then the income and expenses derived from them are included in Net income via the revenue column of the Income Statement.
Where such transactions are used to protect or enhance capital, if the circumstances support this, the gains and losses derived from them are included: for long CFDs as Gains losses on investments via long CFDs held at fair value through profit or loss: and for options and short CFDs as Gains losses on options and CFDs held at fair value through profit or loss via the capital column of the Income Statement.
Any positions on such transactions open at the year end are reflected in the Balance Sheet at their fair value within Current assets and Creditors.
i Gearing - The Company has no financial gearing via bank loans.
However, the Company achieves a geared position through the use of CFDs.
j Capital reserve - The following are accounted for in capital reserve: Gains and losses on the disposal of investments, including derivative assets and liabilities if in accordance with Note 1 h : Changes in the fair value of investments held at year end, including derivative assets and liabilities if in accordance with Note 1 h : Foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature: Dividends receivable which are capital in nature: and Costs of repurchasing ordinary shares.
As a result of technical guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in TECH 02 10 Distributable Profits, changes in the fair value of investments which are readily convertible to cash, without accepting adverse terms at the balance sheet date, can be treated as realised.
Capital reserves realised and unrealised are shown in aggregate as capital reserve in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds and the Balance Sheet.
At the balance sheet date all investments held by the Company were listed on a recognised stock exchange and were considered to be readily convertible to cash, with the exception of unlisted investments with a fair value of 411,000 2010: 86,000. k Dividends - In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends declared and approved by the Company after the balance sheet date have not been recognised as a liability of the Company at the balance sheet date.

c The Company has unrelieved excess expenses of 40,921,000 2010: 37,067,000.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MANAGEMENT OF RISK The general risk analysis undertaken by the Board and its overall policy approach to risk management are set out in the Business Review on pages 21 and 22.
This Note is incorporated in accordance with FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and refers to the identification, measurement and management of risks potentially affecting the value of financial instruments.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Derivative instruments which comprise CFDs and options on listed stocks and equity indices The risks identified by FRS 29 arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk which comprises other price risk, interest rate risk and foreign currency risk, liquidity risk, counterparty risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
MARKET PRICE RISK Other price risk Other price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risks arising from derivative positions, mainly due to the underlying exposures, are estimated using Value at Risk and Stress Tests as set out in the Companys Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, the Company has gearing through the use of derivative instruments.
The Board imposes limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The Company is exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increases in interest rates associated with the funding of the derivative instruments.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The analysis below summarises the extent to which the Companys assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates.
2011 2010 cash flow cash flow interest interest rate risk rate risk 000 000 Derivative assets 1,553 1,995 Cash at bank 7,716 11,165 Total interest bearing financial assets 9,269 13,160 Derivative liabilities 4,881 4,180 Total interest bearing financial liabilities 4,881 4,180 Total interest bearing net financial assets 4,388 8,980 Fidelity Special Values PLC Annual Report 2011 48 Notes to the Financial Statements 17.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency risk The Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has income and assets which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency which is UK sterling.
Three principal areas have been identified where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and derivative instruments Movements in rates affecting short term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not carry out currency speculation.
However, as a sterling based fund, investments can be made in stocks in overseas currencies and the Portfolio Manager can reduce currency exposure through the use of CFDs.
The Company might also be subject to short term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to UK sterling on receipt.
Currency exposure of financial assets The Companys financial assets comprise equity investments at fair value, the fair value of the underlying securities within long CFDs, the exposure value of put options, short term debtors and cash.
The currency cash flow profile, including the derivative exposures, of these financial assets is shown below.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Currency exposure of financial liabilities The Company finances its investment activities through its ordinary share capital, reserves and gearing via the use of derivative instruments.
The Companys financial liabilities comprise the fair value of the securities underlying the short CFDs, the exposure value of call options and its other short term creditors.
The currency cash flow profile of these financial liabilities, including derivative liabilities, is shown below.

Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
COUNTERPARTY RISK Certain of the derivative instruments in which the Company may invest are not traded on an exchange but will instead be traded between counterparties based on contractual relationships, under the terms outlined in the International Swap Dealers Associations ISDA market standard derivative legal documentation.
As a result the Company is subject to the risk that a counterparty may not perform its obligations under the related contracts.
In accordance with the risk management process which the Manager employs to oversee and manage derivative exposures, the Manager will seek to minimise such risk by only entering into transactions with counterparties that it believes to have an adequate credit rating at the time the transaction is entered into, by ensuring that formal legal agreements covering the terms of the contract are entered into in advance and through adopting a counterparty risk framework which measures, monitors and manages counterparty risk through the use of internal and external credit agency ratings and evaluates financial derivative instrument credit risk exposure.
For Over the Counter OTC derivative transactions collateral is used to reduce the credit risk exposure for both parties to the transaction.
Collateral is managed and monitored on a daily basis for all relevant transactions and collateral received from the derivative counterparty will be held by the Companys Custodian.
CREDIT RISK Investments may be adversely affected if any of the institutions with which money is deposited suffer insolvency or other financial difficulties.
All transactions are carried out with a large number of brokers and are settled on a delivery versus payment basis and limits are set on the amount that may be due from any one broker.
All security transactions are through brokers that have been approved as an acceptable counterparty.
This is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
At the year end, the exposure to credit risk includes cash at bank and outstanding securities transactions and derivative instruments at fair value.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS RISK The risks and risk management processes which result from the use of derivative instruments, are set out in a documented Derivative Risk Measurement and Management Document, details of which can be seen in the other risk categories disclosed on pages 48 to 50.
As set out in the documented Derivative Instrument Charter, the derivative instruments are used by the Manager for the following purposes: To gain unfunded long exposure to equity markets, sectors or single stocks.
Unfunded exposure is exposure gained without an initial flow of capital: To hedge equity market risk via derivatives with the intention of at least partially mitigating losses in the exposures in the Companys portfolio as a result of falls in the equity market: To enhance portfolio total return by writing short call options covered call writing and the selected use of other option strategies: and To position short exposures in the Companys portfolio.
These uncovered exposures benefit from falls in the prices of shares which the Portfolio Manager believes to be over valued.
These positions, therefore, distinguish themselves from other short exposures held for hedging purposes since they are expected to add risk to the portfolio.
The risk and performance contribution of these instruments to the Companys portfolio is overseen by a specialist derivatives team which draws on over forty years of specialist experience in derivative risk management.
This team uses sophisticated portfolio risk assessment tools to advise the Manager on portfolio construction.
Derivative positions are subject to daily monitoring.
RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS Other price risk sensitivity analysis Changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign currency risk, may also affect the value of the Companys net assets.
Details of how the Board sets risk parameters and performance objectives can be found on pages 21 and 22 of the Directors Report.
An increase of 10% in the fair value of the investments at 31 August 2011 would have increased the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets by 30,193,000 2010: 32,366,000.
A decrease of 10% in the fair value of investments would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Interest rate risk sensitivity analysis At 31 August 2011, if interest rates had increased by 0.5% the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets would have increased by 39,000 2010: 37,000.
A decrease in the interest rates by 0.5% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
Foreign currency risk sensitivity analysis At 31 August 2011, if UK sterling had strengthened by 10% against the foreign currency exposures, with all other variables held constant, the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets would have decreased by 2,725,000 2010: 577,000.
If UK sterling has weakened by 10% against the foreign currency exposures, with all other variables held constant, the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets would have increased by 3,331,000 2010: 705,000.
DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EXPOSURE RISK SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS CFDs The Company contracts in CFDs to gain long and short exposure to the share prices of individual companies.
A 10% rise in the price of securities underlying the CFDs at 31 August 2011 would have resulted in an increase of 462,000 2010: 1,921,000 in the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets.
A fall of 10% would have had an equal but opposite effect.
OPTIONS The Company writes call options on selected underlying equity positions, receiving a premium, but obligating it to sell the physical stock at a fixed price.
Using the deltas of the options at 31 August 2011, where an options delta is a ratio that compares the change in the price of the underlying equity to the corresponding change in the price of the option, a 10% rise in the price of the underlying equities would have resulted in an increase of 13,000 2010: decrease 88,000 in the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets.
A fall of 10% would have had a similar but opposite effect.
The Company also writes put options on selected underlying equity positions, receiving a premium, but obligating it to purchase the physical stock at a fixed price.
Using the deltas of the options at 31 August 2011, where an options delta is a ratio that compares the change in the price of the underlying equity to the corresponding change in the price of the option, a 10% rise in the price of the underlying equities would have resulted in a decrease of 803,000 2010: increase 287,000 in the Companys net return on ordinary activities and net assets.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES As explained in Note 1 g on page 39, investments are shown at fair value which is bid or last market price.
Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the Balance Sheet at values which are equivalent to their fair values.
In the case of cash, book value approximates to fair value due to the short maturity of the instruments.
FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY Under FRS 29, financial companies are required to disclose the fair value hierarchy that classifies financial instruments measured at fair value at one of three levels, according to the relative reliability of the inputs used to estimate the fair values.
Classification Input Level 1 Valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets Level 2 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 Level 3 Valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
The valuation techniques used by the Company are explained in the Accounting Policies Notes 1 g and 1 h on pages 39 and 40.
All investments held by the Company as at 31 August 2011 are considered to fall within Level 1, with the exception of 3,328,000 2010: 2,185,000 of net derivative liabilities which fall within Level 2, and 411,000 2010: 86,000 of unlisted investments which fall within Level 3.
