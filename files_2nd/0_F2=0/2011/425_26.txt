Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards, amendments and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were inissue but are not yet effective and in some cases had not yet been adopted bytheEU : IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 7 amended Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IAS 1 amended Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income IAS 12 amended Deferred Tax Recovery of Underlying Assets IAS 19 revised Employee Benefits IAS 27 revised Separate Financial Statements IAS 28 revised Investment in Associates and Joint Ventures The adoption of IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
The Group does not intend to early adopt the standard.
TheDirectors anticipate that the adoption of the other Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial position oftheGroup.
AccountinG Policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union andtherefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and oil inventory whichissubject tocertain commodity swap arrangements that have been measured at fair value.
Going concern The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the going concern basis of accounting.
The use of this basis of accounting takes into consideration theGroups current and forecast financing position, additional details of which are provided in the Going Concern section of the Directors Report.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made upto 31December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operational policies of an entity so as to gain benefit from its activities.
Entities over which the Company exercises joint control are accounted for using proportional consolidation, under which the Group records its share of revenue, expenditure, assets and liabilities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition orupto effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of the subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
As a consolidated Group income statement is published, a separate profit and loss account for the Parent Company has not been published in accordance withsection 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Afren plc 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 2.
AccountinG Policies continued Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control ofthe acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted forinaccordance with relevant IFRSs.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate ifthat interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fairvalue atthe acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: liabilities or equity instruments related to the replacement by the Group of an acquirees share-based payment awards are measured in accordance with IFRS2 Share-based Payment: and assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations aremeasured in accordance with that Standard.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete.
Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period see below, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, ifknown, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains complete information about facts and circumstances thatexisted asof the acquisition date, and is subject to a maximum of one year.
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirers previously held equity interest if any inthe entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Property, plant and equipment other Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost of the tangible fixed assets, less anticipated disposal proceeds, on a straight-line basis over theirestimated useful economic life as follows: Leasehold improvements over life of lease Fixtures and equipment over three years Computer hardware and software over three years Gas plant over six and a quarter years All artwork paintings are depreciated over an economic useful life of fifteen years.
leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, eachdetermined at the inception of the lease.
the corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance expenses are recognised immediately in the income statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs.
Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
90 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 financial statements Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where another more systematic basis, such as a unit of production method, is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
Contingent rentals arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability.
The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straightline basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
oil and gas assets and intangible exploration and evaluation assets The Group follows the successful efforts method of accounting for intangible exploration and evaluation E&E costs.
All licence acquisition, exploration and evaluation costs are initially capitalised as intangible fixed assets in cost centres by field or exploration area, as appropriate, pending determination of commerciality of the relevant property.
Directly attributable administration costs are capitalised insofar as they relate to specific exploration activities.
Pre-licence costs and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are expensed as incurred.
If prospects are deemed to be impaired unsuccessful on completion of the evaluation, the associated costs are charged to the income statement.
If the field is determined to be commercially viable, the attributable costs are transferred to property, plant and equipment in single field cost centres.
These costs are then depreciated on a unit of production basis.
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and equipment.
Property, plant and equipment related to production activities are amortised inaccordance with the Groups depletion and amortisation accounting policy.
revenues Revenue represents the sales value, net of VAT and royalties paid in kind or where the financial obligation does not fall directly to Afren, of the Groups share of oil liftings in the year together with gas and tariff income and interest income.
Oil and gas revenue is recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
commercial reserves Commercial reserves are proven and probable oil and gas reserves, which are defined as the estimated quantities of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological, geophysical and engineering data demonstrate with a specified degree of certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and which are considered commercially producible.
There should be a 50% statistical probability that the actual quantity of recoverable reserves will be more than the amount estimated as proven and probable reserves and a 50% statistical probability that it will be less.
depletion and amortisation oil and gas assets All expenditure carried within each field is amortised from the commencement of production on a unit of production basis, which is the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantities of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus the production in the period, generally on a field-byfield basis.
Costs used in the unit of production calculation comprise the net book value of capitalised costs plus the estimated future field development costs.
Changes inthe estimates of commercial reserves or future field development costs are dealt with prospectively.
Where there has been a change in economic conditions that indicates a possible impairment in a discovery field, the recoverability of the net book value relating to that field is assessed by comparison with the estimated discounted future cash flows based on managements expectations of future oil and gas prices and futurecosts.
Any impairment identified is charged to the income statement as additional depletion and amortisation.
Where conditions giving rise to impairment subsequently reverse, the effect of the impairment charge is also reversed as a credit to the income statement, net of any depreciation that would have been charged since theimpairment.
decommissioning Provision for decommissioning is recognised in full when the related facilities are installed.
A corresponding amount equivalent to the provision is also recognised as part of the cost of the related property, plant and equipment.
The amount recognised is the estimated cost of decommissioning, discounted toitsnet present value, and is reassessed each year in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or decommissioning cost estimates are dealt with prospectively by recording an adjustment to the provision and acorresponding adjustment to property, plant and equipment.
The unwinding of the discount on the decommissioning is included as a finance cost.
impairment Non-current assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount.
Such triggering events are defined in IFRS 6 in respect of E&E assets and include the point at which determination is made as to whether commercial reserves exist.
Where there has been an indication of a possible impairment, management assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset by comparison withthe estimated discounted future net cash flows based on managements expectation of future production, oil prices and costs.
Any identified impairment ischarged totheincome statement.
Afren plc 91 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 2.
AccountinG Policies continued investment in subsidiaries Investment in subsidiaries held by the Company as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates itsfunctional currency.
For the purpose of consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are expressed inUSdollars which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentational currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising are included in the profit and loss for the period.
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of each Group company are translated into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period.
Exchange differences if any arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expense in the period in which the operation isdisposed of.
At present the Group has no subsidiaries with functional currencies other than US dollars.
taxation The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
share-based payments The Group makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, Directors and other third parties.
Equity-settled share-based schemes are measured at fair value excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions at the date of grant, measured by use of an appropriate valuation model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period to exercise, basedonthe Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The Company is liable for Employers National Insurance on the difference between the market value at date of exercise and exercise price.
This expense isaccrued byreference to the share price of the Company at the balance sheet date.
Pensions Payments to a defined contribution pension scheme are charged as an expense as they fall due.
inventories Inventories spare parts and materials are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Costs comprise direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
The cash flows associated with thepurchase of spare parts and materials areclassified in investment activities with the oil and gas assets.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less costs to be incurred in marketing, .
Inventories oil and butane inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value other than certain oil inventory in Cte dIvoire, which is settled via areduction in the amount recoverable in respect of realised gas sales from the Lion Gas Plant.
The inventory subject to this swap is recorded at its fair value.
92 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 financial statements finance costs and debt Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Financial costs of debt are allocated to periods over the term of the related debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Arrangement fees and issue costs are deducted from the debt proceeds on initial recognition of the liability and are amortised and charged to the income statement as finance costs over the term of thedebt.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into swaps and call options to economically protect against exposures to variability in the price of a proportion of Okoro and CtedIvoire crude oil production for 2008 to 2012.
Derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The gains and losses arising out of changes in fair value of these derivative financial instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for in other operating income expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
In 2011 the group entered into a number of deferred put options in respect of production from the Ebok field.
The new instruments were classified as cash flow hedges.
Each period the portion of the gains and losses on the hedging instruments that is determined to be an effective hedge is taken to equity and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, is recognised in the income statement.
The Group has also entered into certain put and call option contracts in relation to its associate, FHN.
The gains and losses arising out of changes in fair value of these derivative financial instruments together with settlements in the period are accounted for inother operating income expense in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Available for sale investments Available for sale investments are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Gains and losses arising from changes in fair value of available for sale investments are recognised directly in equity, until the security is disposed of or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the profit or loss for the period.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at their fair value.
Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in the income statement when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, demand deposits and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount ofcash and are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
Trade payables Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment inthe value of individual investments, plus any gain arising on non-dilutive, third-party equity investments.
Losses of an associate in excess ofthe Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, insubstance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate arerecognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations to make or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
Afren plc 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 2.
AccountinG Policies continued Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill.
The goodwill is included within the carrying amount of the investment and is assessed for impairment as part of that investment.
Anyexcess of the Groups share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition above the cost of acquisition i. e. discount on acquisition is credited inprofit or loss in the period of acquisition.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Lossesmay provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
IAS 28 is currently not specific on how changes in an investees net assets that are not the investors share of the investees profit or loss or other comprehensive income, or that are not distributions received are accounted for.
The Groups policy in these circumstances is to recognise these gains or losses through the income statement when they occur.
Sojitz loan notes and senior loan notes Sojitz loan notes were regarded as compound instruments, consisting of a liability component and an equity component.
At the date of issue, the fair value ofthe liability component is estimated using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt.
The difference between the proceeds of issue ofthe Sojitz loan notes and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the embedded option to convert the liability into equity of the Group, was included in equity.
Issue costs were apportioned between the liability and equity components of the convertible loan notes based on their relative carrying amounts at the date ofissue.
Theportion relating to the equity component was charged directly against equity.
The interest expense on the liability component is calculated by applying the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt to the liability component ofthe instrument.
The difference between this amount and the interest paid is added to the carrying amount of the convertible loan note.
Senior loan notes are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Senior loan notes are subsequently carried at amortised cost: anydifference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the senior loan notes.
Interest is calculated by applying the coupon rate on to the redemption value.
Non-current assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the non-current asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year of the classification.
Non-current assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
3. criticAl AccountinG JudGements And Key sources of estimAtion uncertAinty In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate isrevised if the revision affects only that period, orin the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The following are the critical judgements, key assumptions and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that may have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
oil and gas assets Management is required to assess the oil and gas assets for indicators of impairment.
Note 12 discloses the carrying value of tangible oil and gas assets.
As part of this assessment in the current year, management has carried out an impairment test ceiling test on certain tangible oil and gas assets Cte dIvoire assets.
Management also performed an impairment test upon its Barda Rash asset, on transfer from intangible exploration and evulation assets as required by IFRS 6.
This test compares the carrying value of the assets at the balance sheet date with the expected discounted cash flows from each project.
For the discounted cash flows to be calculated, management has used a production profile based on its best estimate of proven and probable reserves of the assets and a range of assumptions, including an internal oil price profile benchmarked to mean analysts consensus and a 10% discount rate which, taking into account other assumptions used in the calculation, management considers to be reflective of the risks.
intangible exploration and evaluation assets Management is required to assess impairment in respect of intangible exploration and evaluation assets.
Note 12 discloses the carrying value of such assets.
Thetriggering events are defined in IFRS 6.
In making the assessment, management is required to make judgements on the status of each project and the future plans towards finding commercial reserves.
The nature of exploration and evaluation activity is such that only a proportion of projects are ultimately successful and some assets are likely to become impaired in future periods.
94 Afren plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 financial statements share-based payments and fhn options Management is required to make assumptions in respect of share based payments and FHN options of the inputs used to calculate the fair values of share-based payment arrangements and options.
Details of these can befound in note 31 and note 20. fair value of Black marlin acquisition The assets and liabilities acquired following the completion of Black Marlin Energy Holdings Limited acquisition by the Company in 2010 were recorded atfair value atthe completion date, as outlined further in note 32.
The estimates ofsuch fair values required significant judgement to be applied, particularly in respect of intangible exploration and evaluationassets.
Management generally assigns fair values to intangible exploration and evaluation assets to equal the excess of the purchase price consideration over and above the other assets and liabilities acquired, when this represents the most reliable indication of fair value.
decommissioning The Group has decommissioning obligations in Nigeria and Cte dIvoire.
The extent to which a provision is required depends on the legal requirements at the date ofdecommissioning, the costs and timing of work and the discount rate to be applied.
The decommissioning provision will be updated each year to reflect Managements best estimates.
taxation and royalties The application of tax legislation in jurisdictions in which the Group operates can be uncertain and subject to interpretation.
As disclosed in note 29, the Group has significant tax liabilities which may be subject to revision as the Groups tax filings and royalties are agreed with the relevant authorities in future periods.
4. seGmentAl rePortinG Geographical segments The Group operates in five geographical markets which form the basis of the information evaluated by the Groups chief operating decision maker: Nigeria, Cote dIvoire, Other West Africa, Eastern Africa and Middle East and North Africa.

During the first half of 2009 an additional derivative contract in respect of the Okoro crude was entered into for the period 2009 to 2011.
The Group receives a minimum amount if the market falls, but receives a set discount from the market price if the oil price is above that minimum.
The arrangement protects the Group against the risk of a significant fall in the price of crude oil by establishing a minimum price for the Okoro crude.
During2008 on acquisition of the CI-11 field in Cte dlvoire, the Group entered into similar instruments to protect against variability in price of the CI-11 crudeoil production for the period from 2008 to 2012.
In February 2011 the CI-11 instruments were transferred to cover the production from the Ebok field.
The loss of US$1.9million 2010: US$8.9 million loss arising during the year as a result of the changes infairvalue ofthese derivative financial instruments has been accounted forin the income statement net of cash realisations, as hedge accounting was not applied.
In February 2011 and May 2011, the Group entered into a number of deferred put options in respect of production from the Ebok field.
The Group will receive aminimum amount if the market falls.
These new instruments have been classified as cash flow hedges, with a portion of the gains and losses on the instruments that are determined to be an effective hedge taken to equity and the ineffective portion, as well as any change in time value, recognised in the income statement for each period.
During the period the loss incurred of US$10.6 million, net of cash realisations, relating to these instruments was charged tothe income statement in relation to the change in time value.
In addition to the above commodity derivatives, the change in July 2008 of the functional currency of the holding company from pounds sterling to US dollar resulted incertain sterling denominated warrants being accounted for as derivatives from that date, as they are no longer convertible at a fixed price in that companys functional currency.
As a result of the warrants exercised during the year, the fair value of the remaining warrants at 31 December 2011, recorded within other creditors, wasUS$0.04 million 2010: US$11.2 million and the resultant loss during the year of US$0.07 million 2010: US$8.1 million loss has been taken to the incomestatement.
In 2010 and 2011 the Group entered into certain put and call option contracts in relation to its associate, FHN.
There are three option contracts in existence: twoof the option contracts are with equity investors of FHN and there is also a call option between Afren and FHN.
The Group recorded a net gain of US$8.0million 2010:US$nil in respect of these instruments.
The first option contract with an equity holder of FHN is a call option agreement over 7.2 million FHN shares.
The Group can exercise the call option any time during the 2.5 years over the equity investment.
The investor can exercise their put option for 90 days after the call option expires.
The Group has also granted a put option to an equity investor of FHN over 15 million FHN shares, exercisable two years after the equity investment.
This option will lapse if not exercised within 150 days of this date.
As consideration for providing this put option, FHN granted Afren 30 million call options with a 10 year term.
During the year, 6.75million of these options were exercised when the Groups investment was diluted.
FHN has 135 million of issued ordinary shares as at 31 December 2011.

Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include at least one input for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used.
Otherwise management determines a reasonable estimate for the input.
The only movement in level 3 financial instruments has been the exercise of 6.8 million options resulting in a reduction in value of US$3.1 million and anincrease intheoption valuation of US$8.0 million recorded as a gain in the income statement.
The fair value of bank borrowings and loan notes have been determined by discounting future cash outflows relating to the borrowings and loan notesrespectively.
For the level 3 financial assets and liabilities, changing certain inputs to reasonably possible alternative assumptions may change the fair value significantly.
Where significant, the effect of a change in these assumptions to a reasonably possible alternative assumption is outlined in the table below.
These sensitivities have been calculated by amending the fair value of the level 3 financial assets at 31 December for a change in each individual assumption, as outlined below, whilst keeping allother assumptions consistent with those used to calculate the fair value recognised in the financial statements.

The Group has managed the interest rate risk byusing a mix of fixed and variable rates on convertible bonds, loan notes and bank borrowings respectively.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to changes in LIBOR rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax.

The terms of the derivative financial instruments are such that the Group will receive a minimum amount if the market falls, but will receive a set discount from the market price if the oil price is above thatminimum.
Theeffect on Group loss and equity of changes in the oil price on the fair value of the derivative financial instruments is shown below: Positive Positive adverse adverse 2011 2010 us$000s US$000s Increase in oil price by 10% 16,533 1,518 Decrease in oil price by 10% 18,776 2,669 foreign exchange risk The impact of a 10% change in the sterling to US dollar exchange rate is shown below: Positive Positive adverse adverse 2011 2010 us$000s US$000s Increase in exchange rate by 10% 161 1,994 Decrease in exchange rate by 10% 161 1,994 In 2010 the majority of foreign exchange risk was as a result of the outstanding warrants held by FCMB which are financial liabilities of the Group.
The impact ofa10% change in the Nigerian Naira to US dollar exchange rate would not be material in 2011 or in 2010.
Capital management The Group manages its capital to ensure that it remains sufficiently funded to support its business strategy and maximise shareholder value.
The Groups funding needs are met through a combination of debt and equity.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed above after deducting cash and cash equivalents, and equity attributable to equity holders of the Company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the statement of changes in equity.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the net debt ratio, that is, the ratio of net debt to net debt plus equity.
Net debt is calculated as gross debt, asshown in the balance sheet, less cash and cash equivalents and excludes finance lease.

credit risk management Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group.
The Group reviews the credit risk of the entities that it sells its products to or that it enters into contractual arrangements with and will obtain guarantees and commercial letters of credit as may be considered necessary where risks are significant to the Group.
The Groups business is diversified in terms of both region and the number of counterparties and, other than transactions with major oil companies with high credit rating and government organisations in Cte dIvoire, the Group does not have significant exposure to any single counterparty or group of counterparties with similar characteristics.
The credit risk on cash is limited because the majority is deposited with banks with good credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies or with governmental guarantee.
The Groups total maximum exposure to credit risk as at 31 December 2011 was US$428.7 million 2010: US$171.3 million made up of cash and bank balances and trade and other receivables excluding prepayments.

The provision represents the present value of the amounts that are expected to be incurred up to 2023.
Additions during the year relates to additional wells drilled and production facilities installed at the Ebok field.
During the year an independent specialist evaluated the decommissioning costs for the three fields and the study led to the adjustment of the amounts previously provided for.
Management believe the estimates form areasonable basis for the expected future costs of decommissioning.

This loss relates to the seismic business of Black Marlin Energy Holdings Limited Black Marlin which was acquired by Afren as part of its acquisition of the issued share capital of Black Marlin in 2010.
The trade and assets of this business were identified as held for sale on acquisition as an active programme was in place at 31 December 2010 for the sale of the business.
However, during the period under review it was decided by management that the business would no longer be sold but that it would be abandoned, withthe assets of the business largely marine and land seismic vehicles and equipment either put into use by Afren in other parts of the Group or sold onapiecemealbasis.
These assets have therefore been reclassified in the period out of assets held for sale and into property, plant and equipment and had a carrying value of US$0.7million asat31 December 2011.
The results of the business remain classified as discontinued in both periods.

The Groups policy is to award options to employees on appointment or completion of their probationary period and periodically thereafter.
Options are issued at market price on the grant date and have vesting periods of up to three years.
The options expire after 10 years if they remain unexercised and are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest except at the discretion of the Board.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year ended 31 December 2011 was 158p 2010: 108p.
In 2011 options were granted on 5 January, 31 March, 9, 20 and 31 May, 21 June, 31 August, 1, 19 and 20 September, 4 October, 22 November and 5December.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$3.5 million.
In 2010 options were granted on 19, 26 and 29 January, 29 March, 23 April, 18 June, 1 September, 22 October, and 2 November.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates was US$2.4 million.
The options granted during the year have been valued by reference to the Barrier option valuation model, consistent with the prior year.
The inputs into the Barrier model were as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted average share price pence 89.5 112.7 Weighted average exercise price pence 41.9 112.3 Weighted average target price before eligibility to exercise barrier pence 45.8 157.2 Expected volatility 40% 40% Expected life years 3 3 Risk free rate 4.0% 4.0% Expected dividends The volatility of Afren shares was again reviewed following a further 12 months of share price data.
The volatility was measured utilising several formulae, including an Exponentially Weighted Moving Average model and a GARCH Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity model, and over several time periods.
These gave a range of estimates for the share price volatility which is in line with the prior year.
Therefore the volatility assumption was reduced, but will remain under review going forwards.

long term incentive Plan Equity-settled share award scheme An alternative share plan was introduced during 2007 with first grants made in June 2008 to give awards to Directors and staff subject to outperforming acomparator group of similarly focused oil and gas exploration and production companies in terms of shareholder return over a three-year period.
The Afren Performance Share Plan awards a number of shares to Directors and staff based on a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after a three-year period andthe full award is made only if Afren has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies: Borders & Southern Petroleum plc, Bowleven, Cairn Energy, Desire Petroleum, Enquest, Falkland Oil & Gas, Gulf Keystone Petroleum, Gulfsands Petroleum, Hardy Oil & Gas, Heritage Oil, Ithaca Energy, JKX Oil & Gas, Melrose Resources, Petroceltic International, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration, Salamander Energy, Serica Energy, SocoInternational, Sterling Energy, Tullow Oil and Valiant Petroleum.
If Afren does not achieve at least median performance in the peer group, no shares will be awarded.
At the median level, 30% of the shares will vest and there is a sliding scale between median and top quartile performance where only a percentage of thetotal award will vest.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the awards vest, except under certain circumstances, e. g. redundancies, where the number ofawards vesting will be prorated according to the length of time the employee has been employed during the three-year vesting period.
