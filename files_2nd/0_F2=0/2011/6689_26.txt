Pension commitments Defined contribution: The Company participates in the defined contribution scheme of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
This scheme is not contracted-out of the State Second Pension Scheme and is open to new entrants.
The expense recognised in these accounts for the year is 0.2m 2010: 0.1m being the contributions paid and payable.
Defined benefit: The Company participates in a scheme which is part of The Go-Ahead Group Pension Plan.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2009 and was updated by Towers Watson LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 2 July 2011 and 3 July 2010.
The contributions paid to the scheme are paid in line with the schedule of contributions, being 13.3% and 11.2% of pensionable salaries paid to upper and lower tier sections respectively.
The defined benefit scheme is effectively closed to new entrants.
As a result it can be expected that the service cost will increase in future, as a percentage of payroll.
However, this percentage is likely to be applied to a reducing total pensionable payroll.
The scheme is a multi-employer scheme and in accordance with FRS 17, the Company has accounted for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme because it is not possible to identify the Companys share of the net assets and liabilities in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis due to the high volume of members pensioners and the historic interaction between Group companies.
