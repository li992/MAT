Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2011 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED a Basis of accounting continued Supplementary information has been provided analysing the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet, cash flow statement and selected notes between results on an Investment basis Investment Group and results on an IFRS consolidated basis Total Group.
The results shown as Investment Group are the results arising from the investments made by the Group in the 30 PPP projects that reflect the Group's activity as an investment company, incorporating the returns from and fair value movements of the entire portfolio regardless of the extent of control or influence the Group can exercise.
Under the Investment basis, the investments in the 12 Operating Subsidiaries are treated in the same way as the investments in the 18 Entity Investments whereas under the IFRS consolidated basis the results of subsidiaries are required to be consolidated in the Group's financial statements on a line-by-line basis in accordance with IAS 27 revised 2008 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 27.
There is no distinction made by the Directors as to whether the investment is accounted for as a subsidiary or an investment when assessing the performance of the Company's investment portfolio.
The adjustments required to be made to the results under Investment Group to reflect the results of the Total Group in accordance with IFRS are shown as Non-Investment Adjustments.
The Non-Investment Adjustments include adjustments to account for the 12 Operating Subsidiaries in accordance with IAS 27 together with other IFRS adjustments for fair valuing financial assets and liabilities.
Therefore, on a consolidated IFRS basis, some of the underlying assets and liabilities of the subsidiary entities are held at fair value including PPP financial assets and financial derivatives whereas others such as intangible assets and bank debt are recorded at fair value on acquisition and are subsequently held at amortised cost.
The recording of debt in project subsidiaries at fair value would lead to a higher liability than that currently recorded at amortised cost whilst recording the intangible assets at fair value would lead to a higher asset being recorded as compared to the current amortised cost carrying value.
This, together with the associated deferred tax, explains the majority of the difference between the IFRS basis and the Investment basis.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a subsidiary has a different statutory financial reporting date to the Company, its results are included by reference to management accounts.
As of December 2011, one of the 12 subsidiaries has a different statutory financial reporting date, being 31 March.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
The interests of noncontrolling shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests proportionate share of the fair value of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an  basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests share of subsequent changes in equity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to noncontrolling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
c Going concern The Group has sufficient financial resources together with long-term contracts with various public sector customers and suppliers across a range of infrastructure projects.
The Group secured a Revolving Credit Facility of 25 million on 21 March 2011 which was increased to 60 million on 22 September 2011, 20 million of which, if drawn, will become repayable in September 2012 and the rest will be repaid when the facility expires in March 2014.
The facility allows for 2 million to be used for working capital requirements.
As at 31 December 2011, there were no drawings against the facility.
The Group had net current assets as at 31 December 2011 of 39.4 million.
Since then, the Group has completed two third party acquisitions for 31.7 million.
However, the Revolving Credit Facility remains available to the Group for future acquisitions and has sufficient cash balances to meet other current obligations as they fall due.
In addition, all key financial covenants are forecast to continue to be complied with.
The Company completed a series of capital raisings in the year: in April 2011, additional equity of 27.4 million was raised following a successful tap issue of 26.7 million shares in October 2011, additional equity of 1.1 million was raised through Offer of a Scrip Dividend alternative to the Proposed dividend for the period 1 January 2011 to 30 June 2011: additionally in October 2011, the Company raised 130.7 million of equity through an Open Offer The Group has invested in 30 operational non-recourse PPP Project Companies which yield annual interest, dividends and repayments.
The cash flow from the project yield reasonably covers the Groups expected cash flow requirements for overheads and targeted dividend distribution policy.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED c Going concern continued The Group has reasonable financial resources together with public sector long-term contracts across a range of Infrastructure projects.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
Note 28 of the financial statements include the Group's objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Directors, at the time of approving the financial statements, are satisfied that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than 12 months from the date of this report.
Thus, they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
d Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values at the date of exchange of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisition-date fair value.
Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement period adjustments see below.
All other subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as an asset or liability are accounted for in accordance with relevant IFRS.
Changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as equity are not recognised.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Groups previously-held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date i. e. the date the Group attains control and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 2008 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that: deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits respectively: assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
An intangible arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Group's interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Group's interest in the net fair value of the acquiree's identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately as a profit.
e Service concessions The Group invests in 30 PPP Project Companies and, of these, there are 12 subsidiary Project Companies Operating Subsidiaries that are consolidated and apply the following accounting policies.
Project Companies which are joint ventures or associates are accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
In accordance with IFRIC 12 and the various provisions of IFRS, the Consolidated Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PPP and similar contracts within the Operating Subsidiaries.
Results of all service concessions which fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 conform to the following policies depending on the rights to consideration under the service concession.
The Group restates, where applicable, the results of subsidiary PPP Project Companies to reflect consistent accounting policies across the Group.
i Service concessions treated as financial assets Where the Consolidated Group, as Operator, has an unconditional right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor the asset created and or provided under the contract is accounted for as a finance receivable.
Revenue is recognised by allocating a proportion of total cash receivable to construction income and services income.
The consideration received will be allocated by reference to the relative fair value of the services delivered, when the amounts are separately identifiable.
John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited 50.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED e Service concessions continued i Service concessions treated as financial assets continued During the construction phase, revenue is recognised at cost, plus attributable profit to the extent that this is reasonably certain, in accordance with IAS 11.
Costs for this purpose includes valuation of all work done by subcontractors whether certified or not, and all overheads other than those relating to the general administration of the relevant companies.
During the operational stage, cash received in respect of the service concession is allocated to services revenue see part g i of this note based on its fair value, with the remainder being allocated between capital repayment and interest income using the effective interest method see part g ii of this note.
The financial assets are designated as at fair value through profit or loss in accordance with part n of this note.
The fair values of the financial assets are determined in a similar manner to that described in part n i a of this note, with changes recognised in the income statement.
Interest payable Project specific interest costs are expensed as incurred using the effective interest rate method.
Major maintenance For financial asset accounted projects, the cost of major maintenance is recorded in cost of sales and an appropriate amount of revenue that would otherwise have been available to amortise the financial asset is transferred to revenue.
This has the effect of increasing the financial asset by the cost of major maintenance.
No profit margin is likely to be recognised on major maintenance since the principal profit recognition on PPP projects is derived from the provision of routine services.
Debt Debt in each Operating Subsidiary, which is non-recourse to the rest of the Group, is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
For all 12 subsidiary Project Companies, the service concession is treated as a financial asset.
ii Service concessions treated as intangible assets Where the Consolidated Group, as Operator, has a contractual right to charge users of the public services the asset created and or provided under the contract is accounted for as an intangible asset.
The intangible asset represents the construction cost of assets which give rise to the contractual right of charge.
The intangible asset is amortised to estimated residual value over the remaining life of the service concession on a straight line basis and tested each year for impairment.
Revenue arising in respect of these service concessions is recognised when the services are delivered.
f Investment in joint ventures and associates The Company meets the definition in IAS31 1 and IAS28 1 of a venture capital organisation or similar entity and upon initial recognition has designated its investment in joint ventures and associates at fair value through the Income Statement.
The Company therefore measures its interest in joint ventures and associates at fair value in accordance with IAS39, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss in the period of the change.
The fair value estimation of investments in joint ventures and associates are described in note 2 n v i b.
Refer to note 3 i for details of the areas of estimation in the calculation of the fair value.
g Revenue recognition i Services revenue Services revenue in accordance with IFRIC 12, which relates to Operating Subsidiaries, is comprised of the following components: revenues from the provision of services to PPP projects calculated as the fair value of services provided see part e i of this note : the fair value of consideration receivable on construction and upgrade services see part e i of this note : and third party revenues arising on PPP projects are recognised in accordance with the contractual terms as services are performed.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED g Revenue recognition continued ii Gains on financial assets Gains on financial assets relate solely to the Operating Subsidiaries and comprise of the following: interest income arising on financial assets is recognised in the income statement as it accrues using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date: and gains or losses on financial assets that arise from the movement in the fair value of the financial asset.
Gains on the financial assets are recorded in the Income Statement as other gains losses within the sub-heading Movement in the fair value of finance receivables designated at fair value through profit or loss.
iii Gains on investments Gains on investments relate solely to the Entity Investments and comprise of the following: dividend income from Entity Investments is recognised when the Consolidated Group's rights to receive payment have been established as Investment income within the sub-heading Dividend income from investments.
interest income arising on Entity Investments is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest rate of the instrument concerned as calculated at the acquisition or origination date.
gains or losses that arise from the movement in the fair value of the Entity Investments excluding the movements shown as dividends and interest above.
The components of Gains on investments as described above are recorded in Investment income.
Revenue excludes the value of intra-group transactions and VAT.
h Intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised as part of a business combination see 2 d. If they are reliably measurable and separable from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual legal rights.
Only one category of intangible asset has been recognised as part of a business combination to date, being the fair value of the future service concession profits in Operating Subsidiaries as at the date of acquisition.
These assets are being amortised over the life of the concessions concerned on a straight line basis.
For the purposes of impairment testing the present value of the future cash flows of the service concession are calculated having regard to any events which may have had an adverse effect on the estimated future cash flows of the service concession including factors from which cash flows may be sensitive to such as inflation rate, interest rate assumptions or variations to agreement terms.
If the present value is lower than the carrying value of the PPP Project Company then there is an indication that the intangible asset has been impaired and a full impairment review is prepared.
Any impairment charges are recognised in the Income Statement.
i Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment, including fixtures and fittings and computer equipment, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method of the following bases: Fixtures and Fittings 10 years j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, deposits held at call with banks and other short-term highly liquid deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statements.
Deposits held with original maturities of greater than three months are included in other financial assets.
k Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates its functional currency.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited 52.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED k Foreign currencies continued In preparing the financial statements of the individual companies, transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are recognised at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Exchange differences arising in the ordinary course of trading are reflected in the Income Statement: those arising on translation of net equity are transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or expense in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the groups foreign operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the date of transactions are used.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity attributed to non-controlling interests as appropriate.
l Borrowing costs The accounting policy for borrowing costs incurred by Operating Subsidiaries is included in part e of this note.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred.
m Taxation Under the current system of taxation in Guernsey, the Company itself is exempt from paying taxes on income, profits or capital gains.
Dividend income and interest income received by the Consolidated Group may be subject to withholding tax imposed in the country of origin of such income.
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition of other assets and liabilities other than in a business combination in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the Income Statement except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
n Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Group's balance sheet when the group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the instrument expire or the asset is transferred and the transfer qualifies for derecognition in accordance with IAS 39 'Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement'.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Financial instruments continued i Financial assets The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: fair value through profit or loss and loans and receivables.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial assets were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
a Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss The Group has two types of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
PPP financial assets finance receivables in Operating Subsidiaries are recognised initially at fair value.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the finance receivables are measured at fair value using the discounted cash flows methodology, with changes recognised within other gains losses in the income statement.
Designating finance receivables at fair value through profit or loss eliminates or significantly reduces the accounting mismatch that would result from fair value movements in the related interest rate swaps.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are designated upon initial recognition as financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
The Group's policy is to fair value both the equity and subordinated debt investments in joint venture and associates together.
Subsequent to initial recognition, the investments are measured on a combined basis at fair value using the discounted cash flows methodology, with changes recognised within investment income in the Income Statement.
b Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that are non-derivative financial assets and that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as 'loans and other receivables'.
Loans and other receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
They are included in current assets, except where maturities are in greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date which are classified as non-current assets.
The Group's loans and receivables comprise 'trade and other receivables' and 'cash and cash equivalents' in the Balance Sheet.
Impairment of financial assets Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset's original effective interest rate.
ii Financial liabilities and equity Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the contractual arrangement.
a Equity instruments share capital and share premium Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or associated with the establishment of the Company that would otherwise have been avoided are written off against the balance of the share premium account.
b Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are classified as other financial liabilities, comprising of: Loans and borrowings are recognised initially at fair value of the consideration received, less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loan and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Other non-derivative financial instruments are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less any impairment losses.
John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited 54.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED n Financial instruments continued iii Effective interest method The effective interest rate is that rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the relevant asset's carrying amount.
iv Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into or the date of acquisition by the Group and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
The Consolidated Group does not apply hedge accounting.
a Group and recourse subsidiaries The Group operates a recourse treasury function.
There is a Board approved policy for borrowing, investing surplus funds and hedging foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
b Non-recourse subsidiaries Operating Subsidiaries Due to the nature of PPP projects, it is important that all financial risks are hedged at the inception of the project, and indeed the funders of projects insist on this.
Therefore each PPP project fixes the interest rate on its debt.
This will either be done by issuing a fixed rate bond or if the project is bank financed, with fixed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into fixed rate by the use of interest rate swaps at the inception of the project.
In addition, and where appropriate, inflation risk is hedged by the use of inflation swaps.
v Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets is based on quoted market prices at the Balance Sheet date.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in active markets is derived in one of four ways: i Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss a Finance receivables under service concessions of Operating Subsidiaries The discount rates used to fair value financial assets under service concessions are calculated by adding an appropriate premium, consistent in proportion to the premium established at the inception of the service concession, to the weighted average cost of the underlying project debt.
The discount rates that have been applied to the financial assets at 31 December 2011 were in the range of 4.91% to 6.91% 2010 6.02% to 8.47%.
b Investments in joint ventures and associates Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows, from investments in both equity dividends and equity redemptions and subordinated loans interest and repayments, to the Group at an appropriate discount rate.
The basis of discount rates are long run average government bond rates adjusted for an appropriate premium to reflect PPP specific risk.
Risk premia are then added to this adjusted base gilt rate depending on the phase of the project.
The discount rates that have been applied to the financial assets at 31 December 2011 were in the range of 7.99% to 8.99% 2010 8.00% to 8.95%.
ii Derivatives The fair values of derivatives as at the Balance Sheet date are obtained from the banks or financial institutions with which the derivatives have been transacted.
iii Loans and receivables, borrowings and payables Loans and borrowings are held at amortised cost.
The carrying value less impairment provision of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED o Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation.
Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
p Segmental reporting Information reported to the Group's Board of Directors for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance is focused on the geographical risk associated within the Group.
This information is centred on the risk free rates and the maturity of the PPP industry together with foreign exchange and political risk within each country.
Currently the projects that the Group has investments in are in the UK, Europe and North America and therefore these form the Group's reportable segments under IFRS 8.
The financial information used by the Board of Directors to allocate resources and manage the group is prepared on an Investment basis.
The Investment basis deconsolidates the subsidiary investments.
See note 2 a for details concerning supplementary information provided in the financial statements that is consistent with this financial information.
q Statement of compliance Pursuant to the Protection of Investors Bailiwick of Guernsey Law, 1987 the Company is an Authorised Closed-Ended Investment Scheme.
As an authorised scheme, the Company is subject to certain ongoing obligations.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that affect reported amounts.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
i Investments at fair value through profit or loss By virtue of the Company's status as an investment fund and the exemption provided by IAS 28.1 and IAS 31.1, investments in associates and joint ventures are designated upon initial recognition to be accounted for at fair value through profit or loss.
Fair values for those investments for which a market quote is not available are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at the appropriate rate.
In determining the discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates, specific risks and the evidence of recent transactions.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the PPP investments share the same investment characteristics and as such constitute a single asset class for IFRS 7 disclosure purposes.
The carrying amount of the PPP investments would be an estimated 19.4 million higher or 17.1 million lower 2010 estimated 18.6 million higher or 16.3 million lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The weighted average discount rate for the PPP portfolio as at 31 December 2011 was 8.36%.
2010 8.34% The carrying amount of the PPP investments would be an estimated 11.9 million higher or 11.0 million lower 2010 estimated 15.3 million higher or 12.4 million lower if the inflation rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by an absolute 1% from that used in the fair value calculation.
The inflation rate assumed for all future periods from 31 December 2011 was 2.75% 2010 2.75% for all UK projects, 2.1% 2010 2.1% for Canadian projects and for the Finnish project a rate of 3% 2010 3% was assumed for the MAKU index Finnish construction price index and a rate of 2.5% 2010 2.5% was assumed for the Elspot index Finnish utilities price index.
The carrying amount of the PPP investments would be an estimated 0.8 million higher or 0.8 million lower 2010 estimated 3.4 million higher or 3.1 million lower if the exchange rates used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 5% from that used in the fair value calculation.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements CONTINUED for the year ended 31 December 2011 3.
CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED ii Finance receivables at fair value through profit or loss Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows at the appropriate rate.
The carrying amount of the finance receivables would be an estimated 80.4 million higher or 67.3 million lower 2010 estimated 17.5 million higher or 15.4 million lower if the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow analysis were to differ by 100 basis points from that used in the fair value calculation.
iii IFRIC 12 Service concessions fall within the scope of IFRIC 12 where the grantor controls or regulates what services the operator must provide with the infrastructure, to whom it must provide them, and the price: and the grantor controls, through ownership, beneficial entitlement or otherwise, any significant residual interest in the infrastructure at the end of the service agreement.
Each subsidiary has been assessed to determine whether they fall within the scope of IFRIC 12.
Following this review it was determined that all 12 subsidiaries controlled at the year end, fall within this scope.
Service concessions are determined to be finance receivables where the operator has a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset from or at the direction of the grantor.
Alternatively, service concessions are determined to be intangible assets to the extent the operator has a contractual right to charge users of the public services.
iv Intangible assets Intangible assets represent fair value of customer contracts for operating subsidiary projects recognised on acquisition, which are primarily attributable to the service portion of the project contracts, and intangible assets recognised under IFRIC 12.
Fair values are determined using the income approach which discounts the expected cash flows attributable to the services portion of the service concessions acquired at an appropriate rate to arrive at fair values.
In determining the appropriate discount rate, regard is had to risk free rates and the specific risks of each project.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and inflation risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and capital risk.
The Group's overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group's financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
For John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited and its recourse subsidiaries financial risks are managed by the fund managers who operate within Board approved policies.
For the non-recourse subsidiaries, joint ventures and associate, due to the nature of PPP projects, financial risks are hedged at the inception of a project.
The various types of financial risk are managed as follows: Market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk As at 31 December 2011 the Group has invested in three 2010 three overseas projects two 2010 one of which were subsidiaries.
The Group's foreign currency exchange rate risk policy is not to automatically hedge on an individual project basis but to determine the total Group exposure to individual currencies.
The Group is mainly exposed to fluctuations in the Euro and Canadian dollar exchange rates.
The carrying amount of the Group's foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities at the reporting date was as follows: Assets Liabilities 2011 2010 2011 2010 '000s '000s '000s '000s Canadian Dollar 330,488 83,298 313,593 74,893 Euro 342 365 330,830 83,663 313,593 74,893 The above table does not include investments in joint venture project companies, which account for a significant proportion of the Group's exposure to movements in the Euro refer to note 27 c. The following table details the Group's sensitivity to a 5% increase or decrease in Sterling against relevant foreign currencies.
The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities and reflects a 5% change in foreign currency exchange rates.
A negative number below indicates a decrease in profit from operations where the relevant currency weakens by 5% against Sterling.
For a 5% strengthening of the relevant currency against Sterling, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit from operations, and the negative balances below would be positive.
31 December 2011 Profit before tax Translation reserve Net assets Effect on profit from operations of relevant currency weakening by 5% against Sterling: '000s '000s '000s Canadian Dollar 36 808 844 Euro 17 17 53 808 861 31 December 2010 Profit before tax Translation reserve Net assets Effect on profit from operations of relevant currency weakening by 5% against Sterling: '000s '000s '000s Canadian Dollar 30 391 421 Euro 18 18 48 391 439 Market risk interest rate risk The Group's interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to variability of interest payment cash flows.
Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the Group to revaluation risk of its borrowings.
Each PPP Project Company hedges its interest rate risk at the inception of a project.
This will either be done by issuing a fixed rate bond or, if the project is bank financed, with fixed rate bank debt or variable rate debt which will be swapped into fixed rate by the use of interest rate swaps.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Market risk interest rate risk continued John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited and its subsidiaries were in a net cash position at the balance sheet date.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the interest rates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments as at 31 December.
For floating rate assets and liabilities, the analysis has been prepared assuming the amount of an asset or liability outstanding as at 31 December was outstanding for the whole period then ended.
A 1% increase or decrease represents Management's assessment of the reasonable possible change in interest rates.
Effect on the consolidated accounts if interest rates had been 1% higher and all other variables were held constant: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Profit before tax Net assets Profit before tax Net assets '000s '000s '000s '000s Sterling 20,297 20,297 9,308 9,308 The increase in profit before tax is attributable to the Group's exposure to changes in the fair value of its interest rate swaps.
For a 1% reduction in interest rates, there would be an equal and opposite impact on profit before tax.
The impact of a change in interest rates, which would bring about a 1% change in the discount rate for investments at fair value through profit or loss and finance receivables at fair value through profit or loss are disclosed in note 3 i and note 3 ii respectively.
This movement in fair value would give rise to an equal increase decrease in profit before tax.
Market risk inflation risk Each PPP Project Company will typically have part of its revenue and some of its costs linked to inflation at the inception of a project.
In most cases this results in the project being insensitive to inflation.
However, in a minority of cases where the project is sensitive to inflation, this risk will be hedged by entering into RPI inflation swaps.
The Group had no open RPI inflation rate swaps at 31 December 2011 2010 none.
Credit risk Credit risk is managed on a Group basis.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The Group mitigates its risk on cash investments and derivative transactions by only transacting with banking counterparties with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies a minimum of Standard and Poors A-1.
The Group's projects receive revenue from government departments, public sector or local authority clients or directly from the public via real tolls.
Therefore these projects are not exposed to significant credit risk.
Given the above factors, the Board does not consider it appropriate to present a detailed analysis of credit risk.
Liquidity risk The Group adopts a prudent approach to liquidity management by maintaining sufficient cash and available committed facilities to meet its obligations.
Due to the nature of PPP projects the timing of cash outflows is reasonably predictable and, therefore, is not a major risk to the Group.
The Group's liquidity management policy involves projecting cash flows in major currencies and assuming the level of liquid assets necessary to meet these.
The maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities is as follows: 31 December 2011 NonRecourse recourse Derivatives Total '000s '000s '000s '000s In one year or less, or on demand 2,752 87,674 9,548 99,974 In more than one year but less than two years 30,776 8,830 39,606 In more than two years but less than five years 91,551 21,123 112,674 In more than five years 406,963 20,670 427,633 Total 2,752 616,964 60,171 679,887 John Laing Infrastructure Fund Limited 74.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED a Financial instruments by category: continued The above table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to their initial recognition at fair value as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs to the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
There were no transfers between Level 1 and 2 during the year period ended 31 December 2010 none.
Reconciliation of Level 3 fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities An analysis of the movement between opening to closing balances of the investments in joint ventures at fair value through profit and loss is given in note 14 and for finance receivables at fair value through profit and loss the analysis is given in note 16.
For financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, changing the discount rate used to value the underlying instruments would alter the fair value.
As at 31 December, a 1% increase in the discount rate would have the following effect on profit.

The movement in fair value reflects the changes in inflation and interest rates during the period.
Project Companies which are financed by floating rate debt swap their floating rate exposure into fixed rates using interest rate swaps in order to manage their floating rate exposure to movements in interest rates.
9 of the 12 2010 4 of the 5 subsidiary Project Companies are financed by floating rate debt and have transacted swaps.
The fixed interest rates on the swaps range from 4.7% to 5.7% 2010 4.7% to 5.7% and maturities range from 2024 to 2033 2010 from 2025 to 2033.

DISCLOSURE SERVICE CONCESSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group holds investments in 30 service concession arrangements in the Accommodation, Transport, and Utilities sectors.
The concessions vary on the obligations required but typically require the construction and operation of an asset during the concession period.
The concession may require the acquisition or replacement of an existing asset or the construction of a new asset.
The operation of the asset may include the provision of facilities management services like cleaning, catering, caretaking and major maintenance.
At the end of the concession period on the majority of the concessions the assets are returned to the concession provider.
As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 all of the service concessions were fully operational.
The rights of both the concession provider and concession operator are stated within the specific project agreement.
The standard rights of the provider to terminate the project include poor performance and in the event of force majeure.
The operator's rights to terminate include the failure of the provider to make payment under the agreement, a material breach of contract and relevant changes of law which would render it impossible for the service company to fulfil its requirements.
