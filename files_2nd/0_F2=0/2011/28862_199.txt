The new rules impose significant changes with respect to the handling of mis-selling PPI complaints.
In October 2010, the British Bankers Association BBA filed an application for judicial review of the FSAs policy statement and of related guidance issued by the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS.
In April 2011, the High Court issued judgment in favour of the FSA and the FOS and in May 2011, the BBA announced that it would not appeal that judgment.
During 2011, the Group reached agreement with the FSA on a process for implementation of its policy statement and for the future handling of PPI complaints following which it recorded a provision of 850 million in respect of PPI.
The principal assumptions underlying the PPI provision are: an assessment of the total number of complaints that the Group will receive: the proportion of these complaints that will result in redress: and the average cost of such redress.
To determine the number of complaints that it expects to receive the Group has analysed the population of PPI policies sold by vintage and by product.
Estimates of the percentage of policyholders that will lodge complaints the take up rate and of the number of these that will be upheld have been established based on historical experience, guidance set out in the FSA policy statements and on anticipated customer contact.
A one percent rise in the take up rate across the entire population of PPI policies would increase the provision by 95 million: a one percent fall would reduce the provision by the same amount.
Interest that will be payable on successful complaints has been included in the provision as has the estimated cost to the Group of administering the redress process.
The Group expects the majority of the cash outflows associated with this provision to have occurred by the end of 2013.
There are uncertainties as to the eventual cost of redress which will depend on actual complaint volumes, uphold rates and average redress costs: and in particular, the results of the past book review to be conducted in 2012 and any additional reviews that may be required.
2 Includes property provisions and other provisions arising in the normal course of business.
