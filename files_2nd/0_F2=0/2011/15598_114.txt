The measure of volatility used in the Groups option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share over a period of time.
In estimating the future volatility of the Companys share price, the Board considers the historical volatility of the share price over the most recent period that is generally commensurate with the expected term of the option, taking into account the remaining contractual life of the option.

The most significant of these are the funded defined benefit pension schemes for the Groups employees in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and South Korea.
Defined contribution plans The contributions payable for defined contribution schemes of 14m 2010 12m have been recognised in the Group Income Statement.
Defined benefit plans UK The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
Towers Watson Limited, an independent actuary, carried out the latest triennial actuarial assessment of the scheme as at 31 March 2008, using the projected unit method.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation, the actuarial deficit was 275m.
The market value of the schemes assets was 3,987m and these assets represented 94% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
During the financial year, the Dobbies Pension Scheme was merged into the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme.
As the Dobbies Scheme was already part of the Group, there has been no impact on the overall disclosures.
The Dobbies Scheme had a net liability of 0.6m at 26 February 2011 which was merged into the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme.
TESCO PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 137 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financial statements NOTE 28 POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS CONTINUED Overseas The most significant overseas schemes are the funded defined benefit pension schemes which operate in the Republic of Ireland and South Korea.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the Republic of Ireland scheme as at 1 April 2010.
The valuations used for IAS 19 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Towers Watson Limited to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 26 February 2011.
The schemes assets are stated at their market values as at 26 February 2011.
Towers Watson Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland and South Korea valuations.
The liabilities relating to retirement healthcare benefits have also been determined in accordance with IAS 19 and are incorporated in the following tables.
Principal assumptions During the year the government announced that the Consumer Price Index CPI rather than the Retail Price Index RPI should be used as the basis of the calculation of inflation for the statutory index-linked features of retirement benefits Accordingly the value of liabilities due to the past service cost of deferred members has been reduced by 270m with the corresponding credit to actuarial gains in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The major assumptions, on a weighted average basis, used by the actuaries were as detailed below: 2011 2010 % % Discount rate 5.9 5.9 Price inflation 3.5 3.6 Rate of increase in salaries 3.6 3.6 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.3 3.4 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.8 3.6 Rate of increase in career average benefits 3.5 3.6 In excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension GMP element.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate the excess of the discount rate over the rate of price inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 150m and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 14m.
UK mortality assumptions The Company conducts analysis of mortality trends under the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme in the UK as part of the triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
At the latest triennial actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008 the following assumptions were adopted for funding purposes: Base tables: PMA92C00 for male members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be one year younger than actual age.
PFA92C00 for female members with cohort improvements to 2000 and members taken to be half a year older than actual age.
These assumptions were used for the calculation of the pension liability as at 26 February 2011 for the main UK scheme.
The mortality assumptions used are based on tables that have been updated in line with medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum from 31 March 2008 to 26 February 2011.
In addition, the allowance for future mortality improvements incorporates medium cohort projections with a minimum improvement of 1% per annum.
The following table illustrates the expectation of life of an average member retiring at age 65 at the balance sheet date and a member reaching age 65 at the same date 25 years: 2011 2010 years years Retiring at reporting date at age 65: Male 21.7 21.6 Female 23.5 23.4 Retiring at reporting date 25 years at age 65: Male 24.1 24.0 Female 26.0 25.9 Rates of return on scheme assets The assets in the defined benefit pension schemes and the expected nominal rates of return were: 2011 2010 Long-term Market Long-term Market rate of return value rate of return value % m % m Equities 8.5 3,032 8.7 2,521 Bonds 5.0 1,116 5.1 1,233 Property 6.8 511 7.0 343 Other alternative assets 8.5 564 8.7 484 Cash 4.0 385 4.1 115 Total market value of assets 5,608 4,696 The expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective returns expected on the separate asset classes.
The expected rate of return on equities and cash have both been set having regard to expected returns over the medium term, as calculated by the Companys independent actuary.
The expected rate of return on bonds was measured directly from actual yields for gilts and corporate bond stocks.
The above rate takes into account the actual mix of UK gilts, UK corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the balance sheet date.
