Pensions and other post-retirement benefits During the period, the Group operated two funded defined benefit pension schemes: the Spirit Group Pension Scheme SGPS and the Spirit Group Retail Pension Scheme SGRPS.
The pension plans have not invested in any of the Groups own financial instruments, nor in properties or other assets used by the Group.
The two schemes have always been separate from the Punch group, and the demerger did not have any effect on the schemes.
The tables below illustrate the impact of defined benefit schemes on the income statement and the balance sheet and relate to the SGPS and the SGRPS.
