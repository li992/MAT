Prior to 1 January 1998 all goodwill was written off to reserves on the date of acquisition.
3,138m of the carrying value relates to acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 and 2,061m relates to acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 the date of transition to IFRS.
For acquisitions completed between 1 January 1998 and 31 December 2002 no value was ascribed to intangibles other than goodwill and the goodwill on each acquisition was amortised over a period of up to 20 years.
On adoption of IFRS on 1 January 2003, the Group chose not to restate the goodwill balance and at that date the balance was frozen i. e. amortisation ceased.
If goodwill had been restated then a significant value would have been ascribed to other intangible assets, which would be subject to amortisation, and the carrying value of goodwill would be significantly lower.
For acquisitions completed after 1 January 2003 value has been ascribed to other intangible assets which are amortised.
Other intangible assets Other intangibles acquired include content, technology, contracts and software rights.
Amortisation of 10m 2010: 3m is included in the income statement in cost of goods sold and 177m 2010: 149m in administrative and other expenses.
In 2011 nil 2010: 12m of amortisation relates to discontinued operations.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill Impairment tests have been carried out where appropriate as described below.
The recoverable amount for each unit tested exceeds its carrying value.
Goodwill in respect of continuing operations is allocated to 13 cash-generating units CGUs within the business segments as follows: All figures in millions 2011 2010 US Education Publishing 2,127 1,976 US School Assessment and Information 792 683 Canada 192 197 International Emerging Markets 508 310 International UK 460 398 International Rest Of World 228 205 Professional Publishing 13 13 Professional Assessment and Training 377 287 Pearson Education total 4,697 4,069 Financial Times 49 48 Mergermarket 138 136 FT Group total 187 184 Penguin US 198 196 Penguin UK 102 103 Penguin Asia Pacific & International 15 16 Penguin total 315 315 Total goodwill 5,199 4,568 Following a reorganisation within the International Education business the CGUs have been re-analysed into Emerging Markets, UK and Rest Of World to align with the management and reporting structure.
The goodwill has been reallocated accordingly.
The recoverable amount of each CGU is based on value in use calculations.
Goodwill is tested for impairment annually.
Other than goodwill there are no intangible assets with indefinite lives.
The goodwill is generally denominated in the currency of the relevant cash flows and therefore the impairment review is not materially sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations.
Key assumptions The value in use calculations use cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used by management in the value in use calculations were: Discount rate The discount rate is based on the risk-free rate for government bonds, adjusted for a risk premium to reflect the increased risk in investing in equities.
The risk premium adjustment is assessed for each specific CGU.
The average pre-tax discount rates used are in the range of 10.7% to 13.3% for the Pearson Education businesses 2010: 11.2% to 12.1%, 11.6% to 17.9% for the FT Group businesses 2010: 12.9% to 20.0% and 10.7% to 12.5% for the Penguin businesses 2010: 10.5% to 13.0%.
