a Market risk i Gold price risk Gold price risk is the risk that fluctuations in the price of gold will have an adverse effect on current or future earnings.
The Group may use derivative financial instruments to hedge some of its exposure to fluctuations in gold prices.
In order to protect against the impact of falling gold prices, the Group enters into hedging transactions which provide a minimum price to cover non-discretionary operating expenses, repayments due under the Groups financing facilities and sustaining capital.
The Groups forecast production is currently unhedged, allowing it to take advantage of increases in gold prices.
The Group also has exposure to decrease in gold prices.
Prior to February 26, 2010 call and put options were used by the Group to manage the gold price risk.
On February 26, 2010 the Group terminated its gold hedging facilities and in the period from February 26, 2010 to December 30, 2011 has maintained an unhedged position in relation to gold price risk.
On December 30, 2011, the Group entered into a 3-year $80 million gold prepayment facility.
The facility was drawn down on January 3, 2012.
The 3-year loan is repayable in physical gold and the number of ounces to be provided is linked to the prevailing gold price.
The notional repayment obligation over the three years is 66,240oz with a reference price of $1,500 per ounce.
The minimum ounces repayable over the term of the facility principal and interest is 56,304oz and the maximum ounces repayable over the three year period is 76,176oz.
ii Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency United States dollars.
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures primarily with respect to the Papua New Guinea Kina, the Australian Dollar, the Solomon Island Dollar and the British Pound.

Financial instruments continued a Market risk continued ii Foreign exchange risk continued In April 2011, the Company entered into a forward contract to purchase $37 million at exchange rate of AUD$ USD$1.0645 to be settled in November 2011.
The contract was entered to hedge Allied Gold Limiteds exposure to currency risk on repayment of its United States dollars denominated International Finance Corporation Limited loan as the Company held Australian dollars from the April 2011 capital raising.
No material programs for hedging foreign exchange risk were implemented by the Group in the 2011 year.
The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date was as follows: 31 December 2011 AUD PGK SBD GBP $000 $000 $000 $000 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 7,407 1,194 1,832 3,534 Trade and other receivables 320 630 97 - 7,727 1,824 1,929 3,534 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 8,637 8,201 4,195 122 Borrowings 2,797 16,000 - - 11,434 24,201 4,195 122 31 December 2010 AUD PGK SBD GBP $000 $000 $000 $000 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 6,993 21,908 39 420 Trade and other receivables 3,337 238 34 - 10,330 22,146 73 420 Financial liabilities Trade and other payables 11,726 1,970 604 - Borrowings 514 21,162 - - 12,240 23,132 604 - Page | 101 Allied Gold Mining PLC Notes to the consolidated financial statements December 31, 2011 27.

Had the United States dollar weakened strengthened by 5% against the Papua New Guinea Kina with all other variables remaining constant, the Groups loss after tax would have been $1,120,000 higher lower 2010: $50,000 profit lower higher.
Had the United States dollar weakened strengthened by 5% against the Solomon Islands dollar with all other variables remaining constant, the Groups loss after tax would have been $113,000 higher lower 2010: $27,000 profit lower higher.
Had the United States dollar weakened strengthened by 5% against the British pound with all other variables remaining constant, the Groups loss after tax would have been $171,000 lower higher 2010: Nil.
iii Interest rate risk The Groups main interest rate risk arises from variable rate interest rates on cash and cash equivalents.
No hedging programs were implemented by the Group to manage interest rate risk during the 2011 or 2010 reporting periods.
As at the reporting date, the Group had the following exposures to interest rate risk: 31 December 2011 31 December 2010 Weighted Weighted average average Balance Balance interest rate interest rate % % $000 $000 Financial assets Cash and cash equivalents 0.5% 21,531 0.4% 39,194 Financial liabilities Borrowings 10.19% 49,797 10.24% 58,419 All interest rates were floating rates.
Interest rates on the borrowings are repriced quarterly.
At 31 December 2011, if interest rates had changed by - 50 basis points from the year end rates per the above table with all other variables held constant, loss for the year would have been $94,000 higher lower 2010: change of - 50 basis points profit $109,000 lower higher.

Financial instruments continued a Market risk continued iv Equity price risk The Group and the Company are exposed to equity securities price risk arising from investments classified on the statement of financial position as available for sale.
Investments in equity securities are approved by the Board on a case-by-case basis.
The majority of the Groups and the Companys available for sale equity investments are in junior resource companies listed on the ASX and are included in the S&P ASX All Ordinaries Gold index.
At December 31, 2011, if the index had changed by -5 % from its year end level with all other variables held constant, Group equity at December 31, 2011 would have been $80,500 higher lower 2010: change of -5 % $57,400 higher lower.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not complete its obligations under a financial instrument resulting in a financial loss for the Group.
Credit risk is managed at the Group level.
The Group does not generally obtain collateral or other security to support financial instruments subject to credit risk, but adopts a policy of only dealing with credit worthy counterparties.
Trade and other receivables mainly comprise banking institutions purchasing gold under normal settlement terms of two working days.
In managing credit risk the Group attempts to balance the requirement to have liquidity in the currencies in which it operates against the credit risk of the counterparties with which it is able to trade.
All cash balances are on deposit with the financial institutions that are have a credit rating of B or higher.
67% of the total cash balance is on deposit with financial institutions with a credit rating of AA or higher and 83% of the total cash balance is on deposit with financial institutions with a credit rating of Aor higher The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk without taking account of the value of any collateral or other security obtained.
c Liquidity risk The Groups liquidity position is managed to ensure sufficient liquid funds are available to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner.
The Group manages liquidity risk by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and ensuring that the Group has the ability to access required funding.

Those unrealised gains and losses represent the fair value of commodity contract derivative financial instruments estimated based upon relevant market information at the reporting date.
