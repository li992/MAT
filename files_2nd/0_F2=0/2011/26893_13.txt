The Merchants Trust PLC Investment Managers Review investment flows driving certain commodity markets.
Within the financial sectors we have a preference for insurance, real estate and general financial businesses over banks.
Among the banks we favour the diversified major HSBC, with an attractive developing market franchise, a strong balance sheet, a robust funding position and a reasonable valuation, although the domestic banks offer potentially higher returns with commensurately higher risks.
Dividends The Merchants Trust has a twenty nine year record of consecutive dividend increases and the portfolio is managed with a view to generating a high level of income.
The revenue reserves have allowed the directors to maintain this track record during a period that has seen substantial dividend cuts across the stock market.
Whilst there remain risks to future income generation, the outlook has improved gradually over the last year, with the notable exception of the situation at BP.
Dividends have now started to rise again in the wider market and forecasts for dividend growth are healthy.
The strength of Sterling against the dollar is the only one of four key risk factors that we have previously highlighted to have become a modest headwind.
Currencies remain important but largely unpredictable factors given the amount of income coming from abroad.
