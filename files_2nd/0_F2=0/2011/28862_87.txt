Balance sheet analysis All the disclosures in this section pages 161 to 228 are audited unless otherwise indicated by an asterisk.
The following tables provide an analysis of credit concentration of financial assets by sector, geography and internal credit quality gradings.
Credit risk assets analysed on the pages 144 to 149 are reported internally to senior management.
However, they exclude certain exposures, primarily securities, and take account of legal netting agreements, that provide a right of legal set-off but do not meet the criteria for offset in IFRS.
The analysis below is therefore provided to supplement the credit risk assets analysis and to reconcile to the consolidated balance sheet.
Credit concentration: Sector and geographical region The tables on pages 161 to 170 analyse total financial assets gross of provisions by sector for Group before RFS MI and geographical region for Group before RFS MI and RFS MI.
Geographical regions are based on the location of the lending or issuing office.
The tables below and on pages 162 and 163 analyse total financial assets by sector.
Key points Financial assets, after taking account of netting and offset Central and local government assets represented 16% of total arrangements, decreased from 974 billion at 2010 to 903 billion at financial assets, broadly unchanged from 2010, predominantly 2011 923 billion including disposal groups, principally reflecting reflecting the Group's government bond holdings, most of which are reductions in loans and advances, including planned reductions of issued by G10 governments, despite a reduction in holdings in both 29 billion in Non-Core reflecting disposal strategy as well as Group Treasury and GBM.

Key points Gross loans and advances declined by 55.2 billion during 2011 of which 19.4 billion related to the transfer to disposal groups.
Customer lending declined 37.9 billion, principally reflecting the transfer to disposal groups and the Non-Core disposal strategy - UK down 23.7 billion - US down 0.4 billion - Europe down 9.5 billion - Rest of the World down 4.3 billion RBS Group 2011 164 The tables on pages 165 to 170 analyse financial assets by geographical region location of office and sector.
2 This shows the amount by which the Groups credit risk exposure is reduced through arrangements, such as master netting agreements, which give the Group a legal right to set off the financial asset against a financial liability due to the same counterparty.
In addition, the Group holds collateral in respect of individual loans and advances to banks and customers.
This collateral includes mortgages over property both personal and commercial : charges over business assets such as plant, inventories and trade debtors: and guarantees of lending from parties other than the borrower.
The Group obtains collateral in the form of securities in reverse repurchase agreements.
Cash and securities are received as collateral in respect of derivative transactions.

None of these countries have debt securities, including non-local currency claims of overseas offices on experienced repayment difficulties that have required restructuring of local residents.
The Group monitors the geographical breakdown of these exposures based on the country of domicile of the borrower or guarantor of ultimate risk.
Cross border exposures exclude exposures to local residents in local currencies.
Customers are assigned credit grades, based AQ2 0.034% - 0.048% on various credit grading models that reflect the key drivers of default for AQ3 0.048% - 0.095% the customer type.
