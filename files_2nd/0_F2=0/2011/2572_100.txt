Financial commitments and contingent liabilities Capital expenditure contracted for at the balance sheet date but not yet incurred was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Property, plant and equipment 467 368 Computer software 15 Total 467 383 Future minimum operating lease payments for the group were as follows: 2011 2010 m m Payable in the year ending 31 March: 2011 494 2012 464 460 2013 440 431 2014 413 400 2015 383 375 2016 373 367 Thereafter 5,119 5,160 Total future minimum operating lease payments 7,192 7,687 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of land and buildings which arose from a sale and operating leaseback transaction in a prior period.
Leases have an average term of 21 years 2010: 22 years and rentals are xed for an average of 21 years 2010: 22 years.
At 31 March 2011, other than as disclosed below, there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by Telefonica UK Limited prior to its demerger with O2 on 19 November 2001. mmO2 plc has given BT a counter indemnity for these guarantees.
The maximum exposure was US$128m as at 31 March 2011 2010: US$132m, approximately 80m 2010: 87m, although this could increase by a further US$268m 2010: US$304m, approximately 167m 2010: 200m, in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until Telefonica UK Limited has discharged all its obligations, which is expected to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
We do not believe that there is any single court action that would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operations of the group.
During 2011 the aggregate volume and value of legal actions to which the group is party has remained broadly the same as at the end of 2010, during which the levels had increased signicantly.
The European Commission formally investigated the way the UK Government sets the rates payable on BTs infrastructure and those paid by KCOM, and whether or not the UK Government complied with EU rules on state aid.
The Commissions decision in October 2006 that no state aid had been granted was appealed.
In January 2011, the appeal was rejected as inadmissible.
