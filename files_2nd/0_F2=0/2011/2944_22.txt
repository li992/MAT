The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP under which qualifying CES partners may receive free shares.
The Eaga Partnership Trusts EPT waived its entitlement to the 2010 final dividend paid during the year amounting to 3.0 million.
Of this 3.0 million, 2.5 million has been paid to acquire Carillion plc shares to satisfy the UK SIP awards which vest immediately and the remaining 0.5 million will be paid to fund the international SIP awards when they vest in three years time.
These awards give rise to a charge under International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based payment of 2.8 million.
The Group is not committed to make any awards under the SIP in excess of those funded by EPT.
Where the award of shares under the SIP is fully funded by the waiver of dividends by the EPT, there is no material net impact on the net debt or net assets of the Group over the contractual life of the plan compared to if the EPT had not waived its dividends.
As this charge has arisen from the decision by the EPT to waive its entitlement to dividends and is outside of the control of the normal operating parameters of the Group, the charge is classified as a non-recurring operating item.
Further details on the SIP are given in note 25.
Rationalisation costs of 9.4 million in 2010 relate to non-recurring redundancy and other associated costs incurred to ensure that the Groups cost base reflects the expected reduction in the UK construction market as indicated in the UK Governments Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 and confirmed in the Comprehensive Spending Review in October 2010.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant amounts of goodwill: 2011 2010 m m Construction services excluding the Middle East segment UK construction 233.0 233.0 Canada construction 11.4 11.4 244.4 244.4 Support services segment Business services 1,134.8 805.7 Infrastructure services 52.1 52.1 1,186.9 857.8 Total goodwill 1,431.3 1,102.2 Each year, and whenever events or a change in the economic environment indicates a risk of impairment, the Group reviews the value of goodwill balances allocated to its cash-generating units CGU.
In the absence of any identified impairment risks, tests are performed based on internal valuations of each CGU.
Management consider Support services, Public Private Partnerships Projects, Middle East construction services and Construction services excluding the Middle East as distinct reporting segments.
Goodwill has been allocated to the applicable CGUs within the Construction services excluding the Middle East and Support services reporting segments detailed above.
The CGUs have been identified within the reporting segments as those businesses that generate cash inflows largely independently of other businesses within the Group, and which are subject to independent management.
The acquisition of Carillion Energy Services was a strategic decision which enabled the Group to significantly enhance its support services capabilities and to generate substantial cross-selling opportunities and cost savings in business services and therefore the entire goodwill arising on this acquisition has been allocated to the Business services CGU.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The value in use in 2011 was determined on a similar basis to 2010.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to revenue and direct costs during the period.
These assumptions were reviewed in 2011 in the light of the prevailing challenging economic environment, including the impact of the Government deficit reduction programme and the decision to reduce Feed-in-Tariffs for solar photovoltaic systems in the UK and the sovereign debt crisis in the Eurozone.
The impact of this on the financial stability of our customers, partners and suppliers will be mitigated by continuing to apply rigorous selectivity criteria in relation to their financial stability, the security of project funding and contractual terms and conditions.
Discount rates have been estimated based on pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
Whilst the Group has four CGUs, the risks and rewards associated with Construction services excluding the Middle East CGUs are consistent, and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
Similarly the risks and rewards encountered in the Support services CGUs are consistent and therefore one discount rate has been applied to each CGU.
In determining the discount rate management have sought to arrive at a pre-tax Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC using the capital asset pricing model to determine the cost of equity and then weighting the overall cost of capital for the Group by equity and debt.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for the CGUs in the Construction services excluding the Middle east segment was 12.0 per cent 2010: 12.0 per cent and for the CGUs in the Support services segment was 10.0 per cent 2010: 9.4 per cent.
The annual growth rates are based on internal assessments.
Growth is expected in the Business services CGU at 5.0 per cent per annum for the next five years 2010: 5.0 per cent, 2.5 per cent growth per annum for years six to ten 2010: 2.5 per cent which reflects expected changes to the Retail Price Index and no growth thereafter.
In respect of the Construction services excluding the Middle East segment, the cash flow forecast used assumes no growth, fully reflecting the re-scaling of UK construction activity currently being undertaken.
These growth rates do not exceed the long-term industry average and reflect the synergies from recent acquisitions.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the following year and extrapolates cash flows based upon the growth rates indicated above.
Sensitivity analysis on the discount rate shows that the discount rate would have to increase to 28.4 per cent for Construction services excluding the Middle East and to 14.3 per cent for Support Services before an impairment was triggered.
As at 31 December 2011, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash generating units tested exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 34.6 million 2010: 31.6 million is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 119.0 million arising on the acquisition of Mowlem in 2006 will be 79 per cent complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.
Amortisation of the intangible assets of 125.4 million arising on the acquisition of Alfred McAlpine in 2008 will be 84 per cent complete by 2013 with the remaining amortisation charge continuing until 2019.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 29.4 million arising on Carillion Energy Services will be complete by 2014. finAnCiAl stAtements goveRnAnCe ouR peRfoRmAnCe whAt we do About us 76 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 12.

The first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28 per cent effective from 1 April 2011 was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, and further reductions to 26 per cent effective from 1 April 2011 and 25 per cent effective from 1 April 2012 were substantively enacted on 29 March and 5 July 2011 respectively.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
The deferred tax asset at 31 December 2011 has been calculated based on the rate of 25 per cent substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
It has not yet been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2 per cent rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Companys future current tax charge and reduce the Companys deferred tax asset accordingly.

The provision created in the year primarily relates to redundancy and other associated costs arising from a review of the Groups requirements following the acquisition of Carillion Energy Services CES.
The onerous lease provision at 1 January 2011 relates to a number of onerous leases acquired with Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine and provisions created for property interests retained in the disposal of Carillion IT Services Limited and Enviros Group Limited.
The provision created during the year relates to a number of onerous leases acquired with CES.
The provision is expected to be utilised over a period of five years.
A provision of 19.0 million has been recognised on the acquisition of CES in relation to future distributions to employees from the Eaga Partnership Trusts EPT which crystallises a National Insurance cost to the Company as disclosed in note 30.
In the period since acquisition, the EPT made a distribution of assets to employees whereby 1,873,875 Carillion shares held by the EPT arising from the acquisition were placed into the Share Incentive Plan.
Further details on the EPT are given in the Remuneration Report on page 53.
The utilisation of this provision in the period is included within Eaga Partnership Trust funded charges in the cash flow statement.

Reserves Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
The translation reserve also includes any related current taxation.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred, together with any related deferred taxation.
Fair value reserve The fair value reserve includes the cumulative net change in the fair value of available-for-sale investments until the investment is derecognised, together with any related deferred taxation.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose on the demerger from Tarmac plc on 29 July 1999.
The reserve increased on the acquisition of Mowlem on 23 February 2006, Alfred McAlpine on 12 February 2008 and Carillion Energy Services on 21 April 2011 whereby the consideration included the issue of Carillion plc shares.
The premium on the shares issued in relation to these acquisitions has been credited to the merger reserve rather than the share premium account in accordance with The Companies Act 2006.
The 30.9 million transfer to the retained earnings reserve during the year represents the amortisation of intangible assets recognised on the Mowlem, Alfred McAlpine and Carillion Energy Services acquisitions.
Retained earnings Retained earnings include the reserve for the Companys own shares which comprises of the cost of the Companys shares held by the Carillion Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP.
The shares held by the ESOP may subsequently be awarded to employees under the Groups share incentive schemes.
The movements in the reserve for own shares included within retained earnings are as follows: 2011 2010 m m At 1 January 0.1 1.1 Share options exercised by employees exercise price 3.7 Proceeds from exercise of share options 2.3 Share options exercised transfer to retained earnings 4.3 0.6 Acquisition of own shares 4.4 5.6 At 31 December 0.2 0.1 At 31 December 2011, the ESOP held 74,290 2010: 38,302 of the Companys shares and had a market value of 0.2 million 2010: 0.1 million.
During the year the Company acquired 1.2 million of its own shares for 4.4 million to meet the plans future commitments.
The ESOP has elected to waive all dividends except for a total payment of 1 pence at the time each dividend is paid.
In addition to the ESOP, the Company has also established a Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
At 31 December 2011 the total number of shares held under the QUEST amounted to 129,979 2010: 129,979 and had a market value of 390,976 2010: 499,639.
The QUEST has elected to waive all dividends in excess of 0.01 pence per share.
During the year the Company also acquired 0.7 million of its own shares for 2.5 million to facilitate an award under the Carillion Energy Services Share Incentive Plan SIP for UK partners as disclosed in note 4.
Awards under the SIP vest immediately in relation to UK partners and therefore the cost of these shares of 2.5 million has been charged directly to the retained earnings reserve and is included within acquisition of own shares in the cash flow statement.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 83 25.
Share-based payments The Group has established a share option programme that entitles key management personnel and senior employees to shares in the Company.
Full details of share option schemes can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 52 to 53.
In addition, under the terms of the Groups bonus arrangements, senior employees and Executive Directors receive a proportion of their bonus in shares, which vest a year after the award for senior employees and two years after the award in respect of Executive Directors.
The recognition and measurement principles in International Financial Reporting Standard 2 Share-based payment IFRS 2 have not been applied to grants of options before 7 November 2002 in accordance with the transitional provisions in International Financial Reporting Standard 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 2.

Shares awarded under the SIP to UK partners vest immediately and therefore the share-based payment charge is recognised in full at the date of award.
Shares awarded under the SIP to international partners have a three year vesting period and the share-based payment charge is recognised over the vesting period.
The expected life of the options is taken to be the full vesting period, as historical exercise patterns have shown this to be appropriate.
The estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest ignores the possibility that market conditions will or will not be achieved given that these market conditions are already included in the fair value of the options.

The Group considers such guarantees and counter indemnities to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
The Group treats guarantees and counter indemnities of this nature as contingent liabilities until such time as it becomes probable that the Group will be required to make a payment under the terms of the arrangement.
Claims under contracts and other agreements, including joint arrangements, are outstanding in the normal course of business.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 85 26.
Guarantees and contingent liabilities continued The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
There are no liabilities of jointly controlled entities for which the Group is contingently liable.

In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies are to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily the Middle East and Canada.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets that exceed 10 million equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, to at least 60 per cent of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging of overseas operations is achieved through borrowing denominated in the relevant foreign currencies or, where this is not practicable, in a currency which the relevant currency closely follows.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
Primarily the Group has relatively small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures.
Any individual exposures that are significant are hedged using forward contracts or other appropriate risk management techniques.
Further details concerning the risks associated with the overseas regions in which the Group operates can be found in the operating and financial review on page 33. finAnCiAl stAtements goveRnAnCe ouR peRfoRmAnCe whAt we do About us 86 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.
Financial instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The carrying amount of the Groups borrowing denominated in foreign currency is as follows: 2011 2010 m m United States of America Dollar 16.3 17.6 Canadian Dollar 94.8 82.0 United Arab Emirates Dirham 7.9 7.9 Other 1.9 2.1 120.9 109.6 Of the total foreign currency borrowing of 120.9 million 2010: 109.6 million, the amount of borrowing used for hedging overseas currency asset amounts to 86.4 million 2010: 65.4 million.
The foreign exchange gain of 0.1 million 2010: 3.8 million loss on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve as these hedging loans are effective hedges.
The Group does not have a significant amount of foreign currency exposure in respect of financial assets.
Each movement of five per cent in exchange rates against sterling would have changed reported profit before tax and equity as follows: Five per cent increase Five per cent decrease Profit Equity Profit Equity m m m m United States of America Dollar 0.8 0.9 Canadian Dollar 2.9 3.2 Euro 0.4 1.1 0.4 1.2 United Arab Emirates Dirham 1.7 4.1 1.8 4.6 Oman Rials 0.9 0.7 0.7 1.0 Danish Kroner 1.2 1.3 Other 0.6 0.7 Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly drawn from committed bank facilities to fund acquisitions and ongoing working capital requirements.
In addition, foreign currency denominated borrowings have been drawn under the facilities to hedge net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowing is subject to floating rates of interest linked to London Interbank Offered Rate.
During 2011, the Group secured additional finance of 100 million from a private placement at fixed rates of interest, as disclosed in note 20.
The principal purpose of raising this finance at fixed interest rates was to ensure that around 20% of the Groups borrowing was not subject to floating rates of interest which may increase.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
A one percentage point rise in interest rates in respect of US dollar denominated borrowings would increase the annual net interest charge by approximately 0.1 million, in respect of Canadian dollar denominated borrowings an increase of 0.6 million, in respect of sterling denominated borrowings an increase of 2.8 million, and in respect of United Arab Emirates Dirham denominated borrowings an increase of 0.1 million.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowings are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of a syndicated facility, a bilateral facility, private placement financing and short term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.

Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency contracts are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are approved at main Board level or within predetermined limits.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying value of each financial asset.
The maximum exposure to credit risk for receivables at the 31 December 2011 by geographic region was: 2011 2010 m m United Kingdom 171.2 153.2 Middle East 34.2 39.8 Canada 75.6 86.7 Rest of the World 1.7 3.4 282.7 283.1 finAnCiAl stAtements goveRnAnCe ouR peRfoRmAnCe whAt we do About us 88 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.

Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of an impairment provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the impairment provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
The ageing of trade receivables is as follows: 2011 2010 Net trade Net trade receivables Impairment receivables Impairment m m m m Not past due 166.3 180.3 Past due less than three months 85.3 1.2 72.1 0.5 Past due between three and six months 11.7 1.0 13.1 1.6 Past due between six and 12 months 9.7 2.4 4.3 0.5 Past due more than 12 months 9.7 5.7 13.3 5.2 282.7 10.3 283.1 7.8 2011 2010 m m At 1 January 7.8 9.6 Provision acquired 2.6 Provision created 1.1 0.5 Provision utilised 0.8 1.4 Provision released 0.4 0.9 At 31 December 10.3 7.8 Whilst uncertainty surrounding counterparty risk has increased due to the prevailing economic climate, on balance the Group believes that debtors will meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are past due and unprovided as at 31 December 2011.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments 2011 2010 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward foreign currency contracts and options 0.9 0.2 0.9 0.2 The movement in fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and options has been recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
In addition to the above, a number of the Groups Public Private Partnership PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
The life of these hedge arrangements track PPP contract terms and hedge future movements across a range spanning up until February 2040.
The fair value of these derivatives is based on quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the share of change in fair value of effective cash flow hedges within jointly controlled entities in the statement of comprehensive income.
At 31 December 2011 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 161.3 million 2010: 107.4 million of which 34.0 million 2010: 35.1 million and the related deferred tax asset of 8.5 million 2010: 9.5 million has been recognised in the hedging reserve.
Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 89 27.
Financial instruments continued Fair values Financial instruments carried at fair value in the balance sheet are non-current asset investments and derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of the investment in Aspire Defence Holdings Limited is determined based on a level 3 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are not based on market data.
Fair value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows using asset specific discount rates, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in the fair value movement on available for sale assets in the statement of comprehensive income.
The movement in the fair value of the investment in Aspire Defence Holdings Limited derived using a level 3 valuation method is shown below: m At 1 January 2011 41.9 Additions 3.0 Recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 5.0 At 31 December 2011 49.9 The fair value of the investment in Aspire Defence Holdings Limited is most sensitive to movements in the discount rate used.
A one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the fair value by 4.8 million.
The fair value of the equity investment in Homesun Holdings Limited cannot be measured reliably as the equity instrument is not quoted in an active market and the Groups shareholding of 9.1% does not give significant influence over access to cash flow information to derive a level 3 fair value.
For these reasons the equity interest in Homesun Holdings Limited is carried in the statement of financial position at cost of 1.4 million.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on a level 2 valuation method, using inputs from quoted prices in active markets, with the movement in fair value each year recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.

Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal debt and equity structure.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of the dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Group has a policy of progressively increasing dividends paid to shareholders broadly in line with earnings per share growth, after taking account of the investment needs of the business.
No changes were made in the objectives, policies or process during the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010. finAnCiAl stAtements goveRnAnCe ouR peRfoRmAnCe whAt we do About us 90 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 27.

Acquisitions and disposals Acquisitions On 14 February 2011, Carillion plc purchased 41,580,041 Eaga plc shares in the market, representing 16.5 per cent of the issued share capital, at a cash cost of 49.9 million.
On 21 April 2011, the Group obtained control of the remaining issued share capital of Eaga plc, which when combined with the cost of acquiring shares on 14 February 2011, resulted in a total consideration of 298.4 million.
The total consideration was satisfied by the issue of 30.6 million Carillion plc shares valued at the quoted mid-market price at the close of business on the day preceding the effective date of acquisition of 384.36 pence and 181.2 million in cash.
On acquisition, Eaga plc was rebranded Carillion Energy Services CES.
CES is a leading provider of energy efficiency solutions.
The Group believes that the acquisition represents a strategic move that will provide the Group with a strong position in a number of new and attractive markets and enhance its ability to provide existing and new customers with integrated support services solutions.
The Group believes it can achieve synergies in the enlarged Group of 25 million per annum by the end of 2013 with one-off costs of delivering those savings in the region of 40 million.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities: Acquirees net assets liabilities at the acquisition date Fair value Fair value Accounting Acquired Carrying adjustments adjustments policy intangible Recognised amounts goodwill other adjustments assets values m m m m m m Property, plant and equipment 12.5 12.5 Intangible assets 61.1 61.1 29.4 29.4 Investments 1.0 1.0 Deferred tax assets 20.9 4.8 1.7 27.4 Inventories 54.0 54.0 Trade and other receivables 103.7 6.6 97.1 Income tax 3.2 3.2 Derivative assets 1.7 1.7 Current asset investments 8.0 8.0 Net cash and cash equivalents 1.5 1.5 Borrowing 60.0 60.0 Trade and other payables 156.1 156.1 Retirement benefit liabilities 0.8 0.8 Deferred tax liabilities 7.6 7.6 Provisions 20.0 19.0 39.0 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 27.7 61.1 14.2 4.9 21.8 30.7 Goodwill recognised on acquisition 329.1 Total consideration 298.4 Based on the assessment of the recognised values of assets and liabilities, goodwill arising on the acquisition amounted to 329.1 million.
The goodwill recognised represents the benefits of cost savings arising from the elimination of duplication and the potential for significant cross-selling opportunities within the enlarged Group, together with providing the enlarged Group with access to energy efficiency markets that have substantial growth prospects.
The principal fair value adjustment relates to 61.1 million of goodwill on the CES balance sheet at the date of acquisition which is reclassified at the same value as goodwill on Carillions balance sheet under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards.
A contingent liability of 14.2 million has been recognised for the future distributions to employees from the Eaga Partnership Trusts EPT which crystallises a National Insurance cost to the Company.
A full provision has been recognised at the current employer National Insurance rate of 13.8% on the total assets currently held by the EPT which are available for distribution.
The timing and quantum of future distributions are determined by the EPT.
The 4.9 million accounting policy adjustment results from applying Carillions policy in respect of expensing rather than capitalising certain costs associated with the securing of new contracts.
The 21.8 million of acquired intangible assets relates to the value ascribed to acquired customer lists and contracts, net of attributable deferred tax.
In addition to the adjustments noted above, following a dialogue between Carillion Energy Services and Carillions management teams during the course of the due diligence period granted to Carillion by Carillion Energy Services, the 27.7 million carrying amount of net assets acquired at 21 April 2011 incorporates a number of adjustments made to Carillion Energy Servicess initial carrying amounts and followed a review of all balance sheet categories.
These adjustments include a reduction in the valuation of inventories of 14.0 million, following a review of inventory held and its recoverability taking into account changes in contracts, technological advancement and product sales in the pre-acquisition period: a 24.3 million reduction in the carrying value of trade and other receivables, largely the result of the reassessment of aged debt, aged accrued income, supplier rebates and contract receivables in light of contract performance and certain contractual changes during the pre-acquisition period: an adjustment to trade and other payables of 46.9 million to reflect contract related liabilities and other identified obligations and other adustments of 0.3 million.

At the point of obtaining control of Eaga plc on 21 April 2011, the shares purchased on 14 February 2011 had a fair value of 49.4 million as a result of the shares becoming ex-dividend.
As a result of re-measuring these shares to fair value on acquisition, a loss of 0.5 million has been recognised within administrative expenses in the income statement.
This has been offset by the Eaga plc 2011 interim dividend which was paid to Carillion plc in respect of the Eaga plc shares held.
Cash flows associated with this acquisition are included in the cash flow statement as follows: m Total cash paid 181.2 Net cash and cash equivalents acquired 1.5 Net cash outflow on acquisition 182.7 Acquisition costs of 7.5 million were incurred in relation to the acquisition contracts and due diligence procedures.
These costs have been included as a non-operating item in the income statement see note 4.
In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2011, CES contributed revenue of 379.8 million and a reported loss after tax of 27.9 million after rationalisation costs and intangible amortisation to consolidated profit for the year.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2011, total revenue would have been 5,293.0 million and profit after tax would have been 120.8 million for the year ended 31December 2011.
Disposals and closure of businesses in 2011 During 2011, the Group disposed of equity investments in three Public Private Partnership projects and a small jointly controlled entity in the Netherlands.
The disposals generated a cash consideration of 31.4 million net of expenses paid of 0.9 million which is included in the cash flow statement within disposal of jointly controlled entity and other investments, and a non-operating profit of 15.3 million see note 4.
A cash outflow of 1.9 million is shown in the cash flow statement within disposal and closure of businesses and comprises of the payment of costs in relation to disposals made in 2009 of 1.6 million and 0.3 million in relation to non-core business closures as disclosed in note 4.

Retirement benefit obligations continued IAS 19 disclosures The weighted average of the principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the IAS 19 position were: 2011 2010 UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% N A 4.40% 2.00% Rate of increase in pensions 3.00% 2.25% 3.40% 2.00% Inflation rate RPI 3.00% 2.25% 3.40% 2.00% Inflation rate CPI 1.90% N A 2.80% N A Discount rate 4.80% 4.93% 5.40% 5.33% Where schemes have adopted the 2.5% per annum cap on increases to pensions in payment the assumption is 2.3% per annum 2.4% p. a. in 2010 rather than the higher amount shown above.
For the majority of schemes, the inflation assumption for certain benefits is now based on the Consumer Price Index CPI, rather than the Retail Price Index RPI following the change announced by the UK Government in 2010.
The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes, except the Railways Pension Scheme, the mortality assumptions adopted have been updated in 2011 and are SINA YOB MC tables with a 1 per cent floor and scheme specific age ratings.
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specific assumptions based on industry experience.

The previous bases at the last valuation for the Carillion Staff Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme, the Carillion B, the Mowlem 1993 Scheme, and Alfred McAlpine Pension Plan were the PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 years table for non-retired members mortality and the PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 years for retired members.
This is still being adopted for the Carillion Public Sector scheme until the next valuation.
For the PME Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme the previous base was PA92 YOB MC for both retired and non-retired members.
The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefits under the local GAAP, CICA 3461.
The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation to the Post Retirement Benefit Plan.
The immediate trend rate is seven per cent per annum with an ultimate trend rate of three per cent per annum 2030.
An increase of one per cent in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by 0.8 million and the total service cost by 0.1 million.
A decrease of one per cent in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by 0.6 million and total service cost by 0.1 million.
The overal expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.
Carillion has adopted immediate recognition of any actuarial gains or losses through the Statement of Comprehensive Income as permitted under IAS 19.

The Group is unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on transition to IFRS of 85.2 million and taken directly to total equity is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of the schemes.
Therefore, the Group is unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income before 1 January 2004.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out-turn on each contract.
On major construction contracts, it is assessed, based on past experience, that their outcome cannot be estimated reliably during the early stages of the contract, but that costs incurred will be recoverable.
Once the outcome can be estimated reliably the estimates of final out-turn on each contract may include cost contingencies to take account of the specific risks within each contract that have been identified during the early stages of the contract.
The cost contingencies are reviewed on a regular basis throughout the contract life and are adjusted where appropriate.
However, the nature of the risks on contracts are such that they often cannot be resolved until the end of the project and therefore may not reverse until the end of the project.
Management continually reviews the estimated final out-turn on contracts and makes adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out-turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the discount rate and future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 11 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Retirement benefits In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below, are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: expected return on plan assets inflation rate mortality discount rate salary and pensions increases.
Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31. finAnCiAl stAtements goveRnAnCe ouR peRfoRmAnCe whAt we do About us 102 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33.
Off-balance sheet arrangements The Group is party to a number of contractual arrangements for the purposes of the Groups principal activities that are not required to be included on the Group balance sheet.
The principal off-balance sheet arrangements that the Group are party to are as follows: operating leases see note 28 pledged assets securing finance lease liabilities see note 10 contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees for deferred equity payments and performance contracts in PPP special purpose entities see note 26 capital commitments for capital expenditure and equity and subordinated debt in PPP special purpose entities see note 28 outsourcing contracts.
In respect of outsourcing contracts, the Group has entered into various arrangements to outsource the provision of certain back-office functions with a third party provider.
These arrangements are on commercial terms and any penalty or termination clauses associated with these arrangements will not have material impact on the financial position of the Group.
