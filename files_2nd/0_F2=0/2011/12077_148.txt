Advances represent payments made to certain of the Groups subcontractors for projects in progress, on which the related work had not been performed at the statement of financial position date.
The increase in advances during 2011 relates to new contract awards in the Onshore Engineering & Construction business partly offset by the unwinding of advances on more mature contracts.
Receivables from joint venture partners are amounts recoverable from venture partners on the Berantai floating production platform and PM304.
All trade and other receivables are expected to be settled in cash.
Certain trade and other receivables will be settled in cash using currencies other than the reporting currency of the Group, and will be largely paid in sterling and euros.
