Financial instruments and financial risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments, other than trade receivables, trade payables and provisions is to fund the Groups liquidity requirements.
All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are categorised as loans and receivables with the exception of the derivative financial instruments which are measured at fair value.
These are shown in the following table: 2011 2010 $ million $ million Loans and Derivative Loans and Derivative receivables financial receivables financial at amortised instruments at amortised instruments cost at fair value cost at fair value Non-current cash on deposit note 19 0.7 1.1 Non-current other receivables note 18 3.0 3.4 Cash and cash equivalents note 19 236.5 223.9 Current trade and other receivables note 18 98.5 85.2 Financial assets 338.7 313.6 Non-current other payables note 22 1.5 1.4 Current trade payables note 20 21.5 27.0 Accruals 45.7 48.6 Share buyback obligation note 20 7.8 Provisions note 23 4.5 7.6 Currency derivatives that are not designated hedges note 24 0.2 Financial liabilities 81.0 84.6 0.2 The Group enters into derivative transactions, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups foreign currency exposures when deemed appropriate.
The key objective of the Groups treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
a Market risk The main types of market risk that affect the Group are interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
Interest rate risk The Group has no external debt and has limited exposure to interest rate risk.
The Groups excess funds are principally held in the United Kingdom and the United States and invested in on demand or short term bank deposits.
It therefore has some exposure to interest rate risk arising on changes in sterling and US dollar interest rates.
Cash and cash equivalents, long term cash on deposit and forward foreign currency exchange contracts are the Groups financial instruments which are exposed to interest rate risk.
