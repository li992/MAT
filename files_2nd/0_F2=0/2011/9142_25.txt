The pension credits arose as a consequence of the announcement by the UK Government that the inflation index to be used to derive statutory pension increases would be changed from the Retail Prices Index RPI to the Consumer Prices Index CPI.
These changes were announced for public sector pension schemes in June 2010 and for private sector schemes in July 2010.
The credits arising in the prior year and the current year have been accounted for following the guidance set out in UITF48 Accounting implications of the replacement of RPI with CPI for retirement benefits.
As the Group had a pre-existing constructive obligation under both the Kier Sheffield LLP scheme and the Kier Group Pension Scheme, and the changes from RPI to CPI were notified to scheme members, the past service credits have been accounted for as a change in benefits and recognised in the income statement in both years.
The gain of 25.7m in the current year reflects the impact of this change on the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
This change only affects certain elements of the increase in pensions payable by the scheme.
Deferred revaluation and the majority of increases to pensions in payment continue to be based in RPI.
The gain in the prior year of 16.0m reflects the impact of this change on the pension scheme in which the employees of Kier Sheffield LLP participate.
73 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Exceptional items continued 4 On 22 September 2009 the Group was fined 17.9m in respect of The Office of Fair Tradings investigation into cover pricing in the construction industry.
An exceptional provision of 18.0m was made in the prior year to reflect this potential fine.
The Group appealed this fine to the Competition Appeals Tribunal, which on 11 March 2011 announced its decision to reduce the original fine imposed from 17.9m to 1.7m.
The exceptional credit in the current year reflects the write-back of the original provision of 18.0m less the fine paid of 1.7m and the external legal costs of 0.7m.
During the current year the carrying value of properties, and land and work-in-progress have been written down to their net realisable value as a result of the current market conditions and following the values received from recent land sales.
During the current year external costs of 0.8m have been incurred and expensed on the acquisition of Beco Limited 0.2m in November 2010 and Kier Developments Limited 0.6m in April 2011.
Further details of these acquisitions are provided in note 28.

Retirement benefit obligations 8 The Group operates a number of pension schemes for eligible employees as disclosed below.
Kier Group Pension Scheme This is the principal scheme and includes a defined benefit section and a defined contribution plan.
The assets of the Scheme are held under trust separately from those of the Group: the Trustees are responsible for investing the assets and delegate day-to-day decisions to independent professional investment managers.
The defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 January 2002: existing members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was undertaken by the trustees independent actuaries as at 1 April 2010 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the Schemes assets at that date were 622.0m which represented approximately 88% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 22.8m 2010: 32.5m which include special contributions of 12.5m 2010: 21.2m to fund the past service deficit.
Going forward contributions will include an allowance for funding the past service deficit identified at the 2010 valuation date.
The Group expects to pay contributions for future service of 9.6m, being 20.5% of pensionable pay, plus 8.0m for funding the past service deficit in the year to June 2012.
The Pension Protection Fund PPF levy is payable in addition to the above contributions.
Following closure of the defined benefit section of the Scheme to new entrants most new employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
The Group is required to pay contributions in respect of those employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
The contributions paid during the year, and the pension charge, amounted to 6.7m 2010: 6.0m.
Kier Sheffield LLP The Group participates in this defined benefit scheme through its subsidiary Kier Sheffield LLP which has participated as an admitted body in the South Yorkshire Pension Fund since 1 April 2003.
As an admitted body it was granted a fully funded past service position at that date, with assets and ongoing past service liabilities of 65.0m.
The scheme covers 1,146 employees who transferred from Sheffield Councils employment to Kier Sheffield LLP upon the start of the contract.
New employees are offered membership of the defined contribution section of the Kier Group Pension Scheme.
Kier Sheffield LLP is required to pay contributions in respect of these employees in accordance with the rates specified in their contracts of employment.
Kier Sheffield LLPs pension costs in respect of the defined benefit scheme are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The contributions paid during the year were 1.3m 2010: 1.1m.
Going forward Kier Sheffield LLP expects to pay contributions for future service at the rate of 11.3% of pensionable pay which the funds actuary has determined is sufficient to meet ongoing benefits.
Other schemes Contributions are also made in respect of hourly paid operatives to an industry-wide stakeholder pension scheme, and in respect of employees who are members of a local government pension scheme.
The pension costs for these have been taken as the actual contributions paid during the year.

If the discount rate were to increase by 0.1% the Kier Group Pension Scheme deficit would decrease by 11.0m, and the Kier Sheffield LLP deficit would decrease by 3.0m.

These amounts have been included as a contribution received by the scheme.
The past service credits arose due to changes announced by the Government to use the CPI in place of the RPI to determine pension increases.
These has been accounted for as a change in benefits and recognised in the income statement as exceptional credits.
Further details of these credits are provided in note 4.

The first reduction from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and is effective from 1 April 2011.
This has had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset included in the above figures by 2.8m, with 1.8m being credited to the income statement and 4.6m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 26% to 25% was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011 and is effective from 1 April 2012.
This will reduce the Groups future current tax charge accordingly.
If the rate change from 26% to 25% had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2011 it would have had the effect of reducing the net deferred tax asset of 29.9m Group 34.0m asset, joint ventures 4.1m liability held at this date by 2.0m, with 0.3m being credited to the income statement and 2.3m being charged directly to the statement of comprehensive income.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the further 2% rate reduction, although this will further reduce the Groups future tax charge and reduce the deferred tax assets accordingly.
d Tax losses At the balance sheet date the Group has unused income tax losses of 10.9m 2010: 2.5m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 8.4m 2010: nil of income losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining losses, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams against which these losses could be offset.
Under present tax legislation, these losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

The dividend totalling 16.6m will be paid on 30 November 2011 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 23 September 2011.
A scrip dividend alternative will be offered.

88 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Operating review Financial statements Share-based payments continued 23 LTIP Awards made under the scheme are normally able to vest following the third anniversary of the date of the grant.
Vesting may be in full or in part with the balance of the award lapsing, and is subject to the Group achieving specific performance targets.
The awards which are taken as shares are intended to be satisfied from the following shares held by the Kier Group 1999 Employee Benefit Trust rather than from the issue of new shares.
These shares are accounted for as a deduction from retained earnings.
2011 2010 Number of shares m Number of shares m At 1 July 522,664 9.2 525,837 9.3 Acquired during the year 848 Issued in satisfaction of awards 4,021 0.1 At 30 June 522,664 9.2 522,664 9.2 The market value of these shares at 30 June 2011 was 7.1m.
The dividends on these shares have been waived.
A description of these schemes and the terms and conditions of each scheme are included in the directors remuneration report on pages 53 and 54.
Value of share schemes The fair value per option granted has been calculated using the following assumptions.
These calculations are based on the Black-Scholes model for all options apart from the TSR element of the LTIP which is based on a stochastic model.

The fair value of the TSR element incorporates an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded, as the performance conditions are market conditions under IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
The performance conditions of the EPS element are non-market conditions under IFRS 2.
The fair value therefore does not include an assessment of the number of shares that will be awarded.
Instead the amount charged for this element is based on the fair value factored by a true-up for the number of awards that are expected to vest.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Guarantees and contingent liabilities 24 There are contingent liabilities in respect of performance bonds, guarantees and claims under contracting and other arrangements, including joint arrangements and joint ventures, entered into in the normal course of business.
Financial instruments 25 Capital risk management The Group and Company manage their capital to ensure their ability to continue as a going concern and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
The capital structure of the Group and Company comprises: equity attributable to equity holders of Kier Group plc, consisting of issued share capital: reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity: and cash, cash equivalents and borrowings as disclosed in note 19.
The Group and Company maintain or adjust their capital structure through the payment of dividends to shareholders, issue of new shares and issuing or repaying borrowings.
The Groups policy is to carry no significant debt, other than the non-recourse debt of joint ventures engaged in commercial property and PFI projects.
The Groups overall capital risk management strategy remains unchanged from 2010.
90 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Operating review Financial statements Financial instruments continued 25 Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to credit risk, market risk and liquidity risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and interest rate and currency hedges.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major ratings agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are stated net of a bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts.
There is no Group-wide rate of provision, and provision made for debts that are overdue is based on prior default experience and known factors at the balance sheet date.
Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below.
2011 2010 m m Provision as at 1 July 7.4 3.6 Increase in provision during the year 0.2 4.2 Provision utilised during the year 0.1 Provision released during the year 2.1 0.4 Provision as at 30 June 5.4 7.4 There are 50.7m 2010: 53.8m of trade receivables that were overdue at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against, of which 35.6m 2010: 40.2m had been received by the end of August 2011.
There are no indications as at 30 June 2011 that the debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are overdue and unprovided.
The proportion of trade receivables at 30 June 2011 that were overdue for payment was 22% 2010: 21%.
Credit terms vary across the Group: the average age of trade receivables was as follows: Construction 43 days 2010: 50 days Services 25 days 2010: 29 days.
Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Financial instruments continued 25 Market risk Interest rate risk The Group has hedged part of its exposure to interest rate movements through a private placement of 30.3m of loan notes for ten years from February 2003, which bear interest on a fixed rate basis at 6.4% p. a.
The Group has bank deposits which are subject to floating rates of interest linked to the UK base rate.
The Group has borrowing facilities to finance short-term working capital requirements.
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
In addition, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate swaps.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates primarily within the UK such that its exposure to currency risk is not considered to be significant.
Where foreign currency exposures are identified these are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient borrowing facilities are available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of unsecured committed borrowing facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Derivative financial instruments Current assets At 30 June 2011 m Fuel price forward contracts 0.2 Fuel price forward contracts have been accounted for as derivatives held at fair value through the income statement.
The fair value of these contracts have been determined based on a level 2 valuation method, using valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data.
In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PFI joint ventures have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest-bearing debts and associated interest rate derivatives within these joint ventures have a typical term of between 25 and 30 years and are without recourse to the Group.
At 30 June 2011 the aggregate amount outstanding on these interest-bearing debts against which interest rate derivatives are held is 145.1m.
The Groups share of the total net fair value liability of these interest rate derivatives at 30 June 2011, based on quoted prices in active markets, amounted to 10.3m which, together with the related deferred tax asset of 2.7m, have met the criteria for hedge accounting and as a result have been recognised directly in equity.
Financial assets analysis by currency and maturity dates At 30 June 2011 the Group had cash, and short-term deposits denominated in the following currencies: 2011 2010 m m Currency: Sterling 171.7 200.1 US dollar 1.3 0.6 Euro 1.1 1.2 Hong Kong dollar 14.6 UAE dirhams 5.9 Other 0.5 3.6 Total 195.1 205.5 92 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Operating review Financial statements Financial instruments continued 25 Financial liabilities analysis of maturity dates At 30 June 2011 the Group had the following financial liabilities together with the maturity profile of their contractual cash flows: Deferred Derivative Trade consideration Long-term financial payables on acquisitions borrowings instruments Total m m m m m 30 June 2011 Carrying value 525.9 60.2 30.3 616.4 Contractual cash flows Less than one year 518.8 2.4 521.2 One to two years 7.1 32.6 30.3 70.0 Two to three years 27.8 27.8 Three to four years 0.8 0.8 Four to five years 0.6 0.6 525.9 64.2 30.3 620.4 30 June 2010 Carrying value 560.4 8.1 30.3 0.3 599.1 Contractual cash flows Less than one year 552.6 1.8 0.2 554.6 One to two years 7.9 2.0 0.1 10.0 Two to three years 1.9 30.3 32.2 Three to four years 1.8 1.8 Four to five years 0.8 0.8 More than five years 0.6 0.6 560.5 8.9 30.3 0.3 600.0 There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of the Groups financial liabilities.
The carrying value is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
The long-term borrowings represent a 17.0m UK sterling loan and a 13.4m US dollar loan, net of 0.1m of capitalised finance costs, from the private placement of loan notes made in February 2003.
The loans are repayable in one payment in February 2013.
The UK sterling loan is at a fixed interest rate of 6.4% for the term of the loan.
The Group has entered into interest payment and repayment swaps for the US dollar loan, which give an effective 6.4% fixed interest rate for the term of the loan.
93 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Financial instruments continued 25 Borrowing facilities The Group has 90.0m 2010: 67.5m of unsecured committed borrowing facilities due for renewal in February 2014.
These facilities are subject to certain covenants linked to the Groups financing structure, specifically regarding the ratios of debt to interest and profit, and consolidated tangible net worth.
The Group has complied with these covenants throughout the period.
In addition the Group has 10.0m 2010: 10.0m of unsecured overdraft facilities repayable on demand.

Acquisition of investment in Beco Limited On 22 November 2010 the Group, through its subsidiary Kier Limited, purchased the entire issued share capital of Beco Limited Beco.
The consideration representing the fair value of the net assets acquired is payable wholly in cash.
The total of the consideration for the purchase was 2.4m, of which 1.3m was paid in cash in November 2010.
The balance of 1.1m is due in instalments by November 2013.
0.7m of this balance is contingent on the results of the business acquired.
It has been discounted to its present value of 1.0m.
The fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired and the goodwill arising from the transaction are as follows: Fair value m Property, plant and equipment 0.1 Inventories 0.4 Receivables 0.8 Payables 1.1 Bank overdraft and loans 0.5 Identifiable net assets 0.3 Goodwill 2.6 Total consideration 2.3 The acquisition of Beco resulted in 2.6m of goodwill.
This goodwill was paid as the acquisition gave the Group immediate access to the solar photovoltaic market through Becos industry accreditation and the knowledge and experience of its staff.
The cash outflow in respect of this acquisition during the year ended 30 June 2011 was 1.8m, being 1.3m of consideration and 0.5m for the repayment of bank overdrafts and loans acquired.
96 Kier Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Operating review Financial statements Acquisitions and disposals continued 28 Acquisition of investment in Kier Developments Limited On 14 April 2011 the Group, through its subsidiary Kier Property Limited, acquired from Lloyds Banking Group its 50% interest in the jointly owned Kier Developments Limited incorporating a portfolio of real estate assets.
As a result of the transaction, Kier Property Limited now owns the entire issued share capital of Kier Developments Limited.
The total amount payable to Lloyds Banking Group for the purchase was 91.0m, of which 35.0m was paid in cash in April 2011.
The balance of 56.0m is due in two instalments of 30.0m in October 2012 and 26.0m in October 2013.
It has been discounted to its present value of 52.1m.
This transaction has been accounted for as a step acquisition under IFRS 3 Business combinations.
The carrying value of the Groups existing 50% interest in Kier Developments Limited on 14 April 2011 was 18.3m, comprising a shareholder loan of 20.3m net of 2.0m for the Groups share of the retained losses of Kier Developments Limited at the date of acquisition.
The directors determined that the fair value of the pre-existing interest in the joint venture was the same as its carrying value of 18.3m, and therefore no gain or loss has been recognised within the income statement to reflect the deemed disposal of the interest in the joint venture.
The total consideration due to the Lloyds Banking Group for the remaining 50% interest is 91.0m.
The level of consideration in comparison to the fair value for the previous 50% interest reflects the debt-free state in which the entity is being bought as existing bank debt and shareholder loans are being capitalised into equity as part of the transaction.
The fair value of the existing 50% interest has been calculated on a value in use basis, incorporating knowledge of the current development sites and access to clients and employees of the business.
The fair values of the identifiable net assets of the whole of Kier Developments Limited and the goodwill arising from the transaction are as follows: Fair value m Property, plant and equipment 9.0 Deferred tax asset 22.2 Inventories 76.2 Receivables 5.7 Bank balances 1.1 Payables 8.9 Identifiable net assets 105.3 Goodwill 0.1 Total fair value 105.4 The gross contractual amount of receivables was 13.8m.
The fair value of these receivables was 5.7m as it is estimated that 8.1m will not be received.
The total fair value of the whole of Kier Developments Limited, on increasing the Groups ownership from 50% to 100%, is made up as follows: m Payable to Lloyds Banking Group for their existing 50% equity interest and outstanding bank loans: Cash paid in April 2011 35.0 Deferred consideration of 56.0m discounted to present value 52.1 87.1 Fair value of the previous 50% interest in Kier Developments Limited 18.3 Total fair value 105.4 The cash outflow in respect of this acquisition during the year ended 30 June 2011 was 33.9m, being 35.0m paid to Lloyds Banking Group net of 1.1m of bank balances acquired.
97 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued Acquisitions and disposals continued 28 In the period from 14 April 2011 Kier Developments Limited contributed revenue of 15.1m and profit before tax of 4.2m.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 July 2010, the directors have estimated that consolidated revenue would have been 59.4m, and consolidated profit before tax for the year would have been 4.1m.
