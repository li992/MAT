The 2011 prior period current tax adjustment relates to a benefit of $520m arising from a number of tax settlements including the transfer pricing and related matters described in Note 25, partially offset by an increase in provisions for other tax contingencies and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The2010 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to an increase in provisions for tax contingencies and double tax relief partially offset by a benefit of $342m arising from a number of tax settlements and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The 2009 prior period current tax adjustment relates mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments, an increase in provisions in respect of a number of transfer pricing audits and double tax relief.
The 2011 and 2010 prior period deferred tax adjustments relate mainly to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and a reclassification from deferred tax to current tax of amounts provided in relation to tax contingencies for prior periods.
The 2009 prior year deferred tax adjustment relates to tax accrual to tax return adjustments and the recognition of previously unrecognised deferred tax assets.
To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.
No deferred tax has been provided for unremitted earnings of Group companies overseas as these are considered permanently employed in the business of these companies.

152 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 4 Taxation continued Factors affecting future tax charges As a group involved in worldwide operations, AstraZeneca is subject to several factors that may affect future tax charges, principally the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions, transfer pricing regulations, tax rates imposed and tax regime reforms.
It is the UK Governments intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 2014.
In December 2011, the UK Government also released draft legislation providing details on a proposed programme of corporate tax reforms including the introduction of apatent box regime.
Details of material tax exposures and items currently under audit and negotiation are set out in Note 25.

The 2010 item relates to the reduction in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 28% to 27% effective from 1 April 2011.
The tax rate of 19% for the year ended 31 December 2011 is lower than the UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% mainly as a result of the non-taxable gain on the Astra Tech disposal, the release of a tax provision following the settlement of a transfer pricing and related valuation matter described in Note 25 and the difference in effective overseas tax rates as discussed below.
AstraZeneca is domiciled in the UK but operates in other countries where the tax rates and tax laws are different to those in the UK.
The impact of differences in effective overseas tax rates on the Groups overall tax charge is shown above.

6 Segment information AstraZeneca is engaged in a single business activity of pharmaceuticals and the Group does not have multiple operating segments.
Our pharmaceuticals business consists of the discovery and development of new products, which are then manufactured, marketed and sold.
Allof these functional activities take place and are managed globally on a highly integrated basis.
We do not manage these individual functional areas separately.
We consider that the SET is AstraZenecas chief operating decision-making body as defined by IFRS 8.
The operation of the SET is principally driven by the management of the commercial operations, R&D, and manufacturing and supply.
The SET also includes Finance, HR and Corporate Affairs, Compliance, IS and General Counsel representation.
All significant operating decisions are taken by the SET.
While members of the SET have responsibility for implementation of decisions in their respective areas, operating decision making is atSET level as a whole.
Where necessary these are implemented through cross-functional sub-committees that consider the Group-wide impact of a new decision.
For example, product launch decisions would be initially considered by the SET and, on approval, passed to an appropriate sub-team for implementation.
The impacts of being able to develop, produce, deliver and commercialise awide range of pharmaceutical products drive the SET decision making process.
In assessing performance, the SET reviews financial information onan integrated basis for the Group as a whole, substantially in theform of, and on the same basis as, the Groups IFRS Financial Statements.
The high upfront cost of discovering and developing new products coupled with the relatively insignificant and stable unit cost of production means that there is not the clear link that exists in many manufacturing businesses between the revenue generated on an individual product sale and the associated cost and hence margin generated on a product.
Consequently, the profitability of individual drugs or classes of drugs is not considered a key measure of performance for the business and is not monitored by the SET.
Resources are allocated on a Group-wide basis according to need.
In particular, capital expenditure, in-licensing, and R&D resources are allocated between activities on merit, based on overall therapeutic considerations and strategy under the aegis of the Groups Portfolio Investment Board to facilitate aGroup-wide single combined discovery and development strategy.
TheGroups acquisitions in the biologics area, MedImmune and Cambridge Antibody Technology Group plc CAT, have been integrated into the existing management structure of AstraZeneca both for allocation of resources and for assessment and monitoring of performance purposes.
As such, although biologics is a relatively new technological area for the Group, it does not operate as aseparate operating segment.

The recoverable amount is based on value in use using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the Groups pre-tax cash flows over 10 years.
The projections include assumptions about product launches, competition from rival products and pricing policy as well as the possibility of generics entering the market.
In setting these assumptions we consider our past experience, external sources of information including information on expected increases and ageing of the populations in our established markets and the expanding patient population in newer markets, ourknowledge of competitor activity and our assessment of future changes in the pharmaceutical industry.
The 10 year period is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
Given that internal budgets and forecasts are prepared for all projections, no general growth rates are used to extrapolate internal budgets and forecasts for the purposes of determining value in use.
No terminal value is included as these cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that an impairment does not exist.
The methods used to determine recoverable amounts have remained consistent with the prior year.
In arriving at value in use, we disaggregate our projected pre-tax cash flows into groups reflecting similar risks and tax effects.
For each group of cash flows we use an appropriate discount rate reflecting those risks and tax effects.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate for each group of cash flows, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2011: 7.0% for 2010: 7.6% for 2009 to reflect the impact of relevant industry risks, the time value of money and tax effects.
The weighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 10% 10% for 2010: 11% for 2009.
As a further check, we compare our market capitalisation to the book value of our net assets and this indicates significant surplus at 31December 2011 and 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009.
No goodwill impairment was identified.
The Group has also performed sensitivity analysis calculations on the projections used and discount rate applied.
The Directors have concluded that, given the significant headroom that exists, and the results of the sensitivity analysis performed, there is no significant risk that reasonable changes in any key assumptions would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use.

The 2011 impairment charge of product, marketing and distribution rights also includes an impairment of $150m reflecting a lower probability of success assessment for TC-5214, based on the results of the first two of four Phase III efficacy and tolerability studies of the compound as an adjunct therapy to an anti-depressant in patients with major depressive disorder who do not respond adequately to initial anti-depressant treatment.
The value of the remaining intangible assets held in relation to TC-5214, determined using value in use calculations as detailed below, is $50m.
We are expecting results of further clinical trials in 2012 which will affect our assessment of the probability of success of TC-5214 which will result in either a reversal of all or part of the impairment recognised in 2011, or a further impairment charge.
The remaining $117m charge relates to the termination of other development projects during the year.
The 2010 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the withdrawal of the biological license application pending at the FDA for motavizumab $445m and the termination of the lesogaberan development $128m and other development projects in the year.
The 2010 impairment of other intangibles chiefly results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine.
The 2009 impairment of product, marketing and distribution rights results from the termination of development projects during the year.
The 2009 impairment of other intangibles results from a reassessment of the future royalties expected to be received relating to the HPV cervical cancer vaccine and a reassessment of other future licensing and contractual income expected to be earned within our biologics business.
The write downs in value of intangible assets, other than those arising from termination of research and development activities, were determined based on value in use calculations using discounted risk-adjusted projections of the products expected cash flows over a period reflecting thepatent-protected lives of the individual products.
The full period of projections is covered by internal budgets and forecasts.
In arriving at the appropriate discount rate to use for each product, we adjust AstraZenecas post-tax weighted average cost of capital 7.0% for 2011: 7.0% for 2010: 7.6% for 2009 to reflect the impact of risks and tax effects specific to the individual products.
Theweighted average pre-tax discount rate we used was approximately 14% 2010: 14%: 2009: 14%.

A gain of $4m was made during the year on the fair value of bonds designated at fair value through profit and loss, due to increased credit risk.
A gain of $44m has been made on these bonds since designation due to increased credit risk.
Changes in credit risk had no material effect on any other financial assets and liabilities recognised at fair value in the Groups Financial Statements.
The change in fair value attributable to changes in credit risk is calculated as the change in fair value not attributable to market risk.
The amount payable at maturity on bonds designated at fair value through profit or loss is $1,037m.
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments together with their carrying values are as follows: Cash and overdrafts held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised costs.
Fair value approximates to carrying value.
Loans due within one year and after more than one year the fair value of fixed-rate publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given the frequency of resets.
The carrying value of loans designated at fair value through profit or loss is the fair value.
For loans designated in a fair value hedge relationship, carrying value is initially measured at fair value and remeasured for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk at each reporting date.
All other loans are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments consists of interest rate swaps included in instruments designated at fair value if related to debt designated at fair value or instruments in a fair value hedge relationship if formally designated as in a fair value hedge relationship and forward foreign exchange contracts included in other financial instruments at fair value.
All derivatives are held at fair value.
Interest rate swaps the fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon curve valuation techniques to discount future contractual cash flows based on rates current at year end.
Forward foreign exchange contracts the majority of contracts for existing transactions had maturities of less than one month from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows using appropriate yield curves based on market forward foreign exchange rates at the year end.
Other investments held on the consolidated statement of financial position at fair value.
These include equity securities held on the consolidated statement of financial position as other investments Note 10.
The fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
Unlisted investments are held at cost which approximates to fair value.
Other financial assets and other financial liabilities with the exception of contingent consideration which is held at fair value see Note 22, other financial assets and liabilities are held on the consolidated statement of financial position at amortised costs with carrying value being a reasonable approximation of fair value.

The different levels have been defined as follows: Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices orindirectly ie derived from prices.

In the absence of specific market data, these unlisted investments are held at cost, adjusted as necessary for impairments, which approximates to fair value.
Hence, carrying value is adjusted only for additions, sales and permanent impairment and for no othermovement.
Consequently, in the current year, no change has been made to the fair value of individual investments.
Level 3 other financial assets and liabilities arose on the acquisition of Novexel and the subsequent transaction with Forest as detailed in Note 22.
The table above does not include bonds designated in a fair value hedge relationship.
The carrying value of these bonds is initially measured at fair value and remeasured only for fair value changes in respect of the hedged risk.
Therefore, the bonds are not carried at full fair value at 31December 2011 and have not been classified within the hierarchy.

164 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 18 Post-retirement benefits Pensions Background The Company and most of its subsidiaries offer retirement plans which cover the majority of employees in the Group.
Many of these plans are defined contribution, where AstraZenecas contribution and resulting charge is fixed at a set level or is a set percentage of employees pay.
However, several plans, mainly in the UK, the US and Sweden, are defined benefit, where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary typically averaged over one, three or five years.
The major defined benefit plans, apart from the collectively bargained Swedish plan which is still open to employees born before 1979, have been closed to new entrants since 2000.
The major defined benefit plans are funded through legally separate,  funds.
The cash funding of the plans, which mayfrom time to time involve special payments, is designed, in consultation with independent qualified actuaries, to ensure that the assets together with future contributions should be sufficient to meet future obligations.
The funding is monitored rigorously by AstraZeneca and appropriate fiduciaries specifically with reference to AstraZenecas credit rating, market capitalisation, cash flows and the solvency of the relevant pension scheme.
Financing Principles 96.7% of the Groups defined benefit obligations at 31 December 2011 are in schemes within the UK, the US, Sweden or Germany.
In these countries the pension obligations are funded with reference to the following financing principles: The Group has a fundamental belief in funding the benefits it promises to employees.
The Group considers its pension arrangements in the context of its broader capital structure.
In general it does not believe in committing excessive capital for funding while it has better uses of capital within the business nor does it wish to generate surpluses.
The pension funds are not part of the Groups core business.
The Group believes in taking some rewarded risks with the investments underlying the funding, subject to a medium to long-term plan to reduce those risks if opportunities arise.
The Group recognises that deciding to hold certain investments may cause volatility in the funding position.
The Group would not wish toamend its contribution level for relatively small deviations from its preferred funding level, because it is expected that there will be short-term volatility, but it is prepared to react appropriately to more significant deviations.
In the event that local regulations require an additional level of financing, the Group would consider the use of alternative methods of providing this that do not require immediate cash funding but help mitigate exposure of the pension arrangement to the credit risk of the Group.
These principles are appropriate to AstraZenecas business at the present date: should circumstances change they may require review.
AstraZeneca has developed a funding framework to implement these principles.
This determines the cash contributions payable to the pension funds, but does not affect the IAS 19 liabilities.
To reduce the risk of committing excess capital to pension funds, liability valuations are based onthe expected return on the actual pension assets, rather than a corporate bond yield.
At present this puts a different value on the liabilities than IAS 19.
UK With regard to the Groups UK defined benefit fund, the above principles are modified in light of the UK regulatory requirements and resulting discussions with the Pension Fund Trustee.
The most recent full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2010.
Under the agreed funding principles for the UK, cash contributions will be paid to the UK Pension Fund to target a level of assets in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits.
In addition, AstraZeneca will make contributions to an escrow account which will be held outside of the UK Pension Fund.
The escrow account assets will be payable to the fund in agreed circumstances, for example, in the event of AstraZeneca and the Pension Fund Trustee agreeing on a change to the current long-term investment strategy.
The market value of the funds assets at the valuation date was 3,129m $4,832m equivalent, representing 79% of the funds actuarially assessed liabilities Technical Provisions.
The Company has agreed to fund the shortfall by making payments of 72.5m $112m a year until 31December 2011 and then lump sum payments totalling 715m $1,103m before 30 June 2013.
The first of these lump sum payments of 180m $278m was paid into the UK Pension Fund in December 2011 from existing investments held in escrow for the Pension Fund.
A further 300m $463m was paid into the UK Pension Fund during January 2012 with the balance payable by 30 June 2013.
This is in addition to the contributions required to meet the ongoing benefits accruing in the region of 24m $37m per annum.
In 2011, 132m $213m was paid into the escrow account and a further 230m $355m was paid in during January 2012.
At 31 December 2011, 192m $296m of escrow fund assets are included within other investments see Note 10.
Under the agreed funding principles used to set the Technical Provisions, the key assumptions as at 31 March 2010 are as follows: long-term UK price inflation set at 3.8% per annum, salary increases at 0% per annum as a result of pensionable pay levels being frozen in 2010, pension increases at 3.55% per annum and investment returns at 5.9% per annum.
During the first half of 2010, following consultation with its UK employees representatives, AstraZeneca introduced a freeze on pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels for defined benefit members of the UK Pension Fund.
The defined benefit fund remains open to existing members and employees who choose to leave the defined benefit fund will retain a deferred pension in addition to being offered membership in a new Group Self Invested Personal Pension Plan.
The amendment to the UK defined benefit fund to freeze pensionable pay at 30 June 2010 levels represents an accounting curtailment of certain pension obligations.
The majority of members opted to remain in the defined benefit fund and continue benefit accrual with frozen pensionable pay.
In accordance with IAS 19, the scheme obligations were revalued by the scheme actuaries immediately prior to the change and assumptions reviewed at that date.
The resulting credit of $693m was recognised in comprehensive income in 2010.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 165 Financial Statements 18 Post-retirement benefits continued Rest of Group The IAS 19 positions as at 31 December 2011 are shown below for each of the other countries with significant defined benefit plans.
These plans account for 91% of the Groups defined benefit obligations outside of the UK.
These plans are funded in line with the financing principles and contributions paid as prescribed by the funding framework.
The US defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2011, when plan obligations were $1,987m and plan assets were $1,593m.
This includes obligations in respect of the non-qualified plan which is largely unfunded.
The Swedish defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2011, when plan obligations were estimated to amount to $1,545m and plan assets were $902m.
The German defined benefits programme was actuarially revalued at 31 December 2011, when plan obligations amounted to $258m and plan assets were $23m.
On current bases, it is expected that contributions excluding those in respect of past service cost during the year ended 31 December 2012 to the four main countries will be $664m.
Post-retirement benefits other than pensions In the US, and to a lesser extent in certain other countries, AstraZenecas employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
As at 31 December 2011, some 3,431 retired employees and covered dependants currently benefit from these provisions and some 10,694 current employees will be eligible on their retirement.
AstraZeneca accrues for the present value of such retiree obligations over the working life of the employee.
In practice these benefits will be funded with reference to the financing principles.
The cost of post-retirement benefits other than pensions for the Group in 2011 was $12m 2010: $18m: 2009: $19m.
Plan assets were $290m andplan obligations were $330m at 31 December 2011.
These benefit plans have been included in the disclosure of post-retirement benefits underIAS 19.
Financial assumptions Qualified independent actuaries have updated the actuarial valuations under IAS 19 of the major defined benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 December 2011.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the long-term nature of the schemes, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
These assumptions were as follows: 2011 2010 UK Rest of Group UK Rest of Group Inflation assumption 3.2% 2.3% 3.6% 2.3% 1 1 Rate of increase in salaries 3.4% 3.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.1% 0.9% 3.5% 0.9% Discount rate 4.8% 4.1% 5.5% 4.9% Long-term rate of return expected at 31 December Equities 7.5% 7.4% 8.0% 7.9% Bonds 4.5% 3.8% 5.1% 5.0% Others 2.8% 3.8% 6.1% 4.7% Rate of increase in medical costs initial rate 10.0% 9.0% 10.0% 10.0% 1 Pensionable pay frozen at 30 June 2010 levels following UK fund changes.
The expected return on assets is determined with reference to the expected long-term level of dividends, interest and other returns derived from the plan assets, together with realised and unrealised gains or losses on the plan assets, less any costs of administering the plan, less any tax payable by the plan.
The expected returns are based on long-term market expectations and analysed on a regular basis to ensure that any sustained movements in underlying markets are reflected.
Demographic assumptions The mortality assumptions are based on country-specific mortality tables.
These are compared to actual AstraZeneca experience and adjusted where sufficient data is available.
Additional allowance for future improvements in life expectancy is included for all major schemes where there is credible data to support this continuing trend.
The table below illustrates life expectancy assumptions at age 65 for male members retiring in 2011 and members expected to retire in 2031 2010: 2010 and 2030 respectively.

The fair values of the schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes obligations is derived from cash flow projections over long periods and is therefore inherently uncertain.

170 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 22 Acquisitions and disposals of business operations continued 2010 acquisitions Novexel On 3 March 2010, AstraZeneca completed the acquisition of Novexel.
Novexel is a research company focused on the infection therapy area and is based in France.
This acquisition strengthens our research capabilities in the infection therapy area.
AstraZeneca acquired 100% of Novexels shares for an upfront consideration of $427m: with additional consideration of up to $75m becoming payable to Novexel shareholders on the completion of certain development milestones.
At both the date of acquisition and at 31 December 2010, the fair value of this contingent consideration was $50m.
For the ten-month period post-acquisition to the end of 2010 and the full year, Novexel had no revenues and its loss was immaterial.

These antibiotic combinations utilise Novexels novel investigational beta-lactamase inhibitor NXL-104 to overcome antibiotic resistance and treat the increasing number of infections resistant to existing therapies.
In addition, Forest acquired rightsto CAZ-104 in North America and bought down payment obligations to Novexel in relation to CEF-104 from previous existing licence arrangements.
In consideration for these rights, Forest paid Novexel, then an AstraZeneca group company, a sum of $210m on 3 March 2010 and will also pay additional sums equivalent to half of any future specified development milestone payments that become payable by AstraZeneca.
This consideration is equivalent to the fair value attributed on acquisition to those assets and hence there is no profit impact from this divestment.
Cash flows on acquisition: $m Total upfront consideration 427 Cash and cash equivalents included in undertaking acquired 79 Net cash consideration 348 In 2011, the contingent consideration of $50m became fully payable.

2009 acquisitions There were no acquisitions or disposals made during the year ended 31 December 2009.
23 Financial risk management objectives and policies The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank overdrafts, loans, current and non-current investments, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the Groups funding and liquidity requirements.
The Group has other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The principal financial risks to which the Group is exposed are those of liquidity, interest rate, foreign currency and credit.
Each of these is managed in accordance with Board-approved policies.
These policies are set out below.
The Group uses foreign currency borrowings, foreign currency forwards and options, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements for the purpose of hedging its foreign currency and interest rate risks.
The Group may designate certain financial instruments as either fair value hedges or net investment hedges in accordance with IAS 39.
Key controls applied to transactions in derivative financial instruments are: to use only instruments where good market liquidity exists, to revalue all financial instruments regularly using current market rates and to sell options only tooffset previously purchased options.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Capital management The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity Note 20, debt Note 14 and cash Note 13.
For the foreseeable future, theBoard will maintain a capital structure that supports the Groups strategic objectives through: managing funding and liquidity risk optimising shareholder return maintaining a strong, investment-grade credit rating.
Funding and liquidity risk are reviewed regularly by the Board and managed in accordance with policies described below.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 171 Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The Boards distribution policy comprises both a regular cash dividend, and subject to business needs, a share repurchase component.
TheBoard regularly reviews its shareholders return strategy, and in 2010 adopted a progressive dividend policy, whereby the Board intends to maintain orgrow the dividend each year, targeting an average dividend cover of two times ie a payout ratio of 50%, based on reported earnings before restructuring costs and profit on disposal of Astra Tech.
In addition, after providing for business investment, funding the progressive dividend policy and meeting debt service obligations, the Board will regularly assess the opportunity to return cash in excess of these requirements to shareholders through share repurchases.
The Groups net funds position loans and borrowings net of cash and cash equivalents, current investments and derivative financial instruments has decreased from $3,653m at the beginning of the year to a net funds position of $2,849m at 31 December 2011 as a result of our substantial share repurchases in 2011, tax and pension payments made, offset by strong net operating cash inflows and cash received on the disposal of Astra Tech.
Liquidity risk The Board reviews the Groups ongoing liquidity risks annually as part of the planning process and on an ad hoc basis.
The Board considers short-term requirements against available sources of funding taking into account forecast cash flows.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining access to a number of sources of funding which are sufficient to meet anticipated funding requirements.
Specifically, the Group uses US commercial paper, committed bank facilities and cash resources to manage short-term liquidity and manages long-term liquidity by raising funds through the capital markets.
The Groups current long-term credit rating is A1 by Moodys and AAby Standard and Poors, both with a stable outlook.
In addition to cash and cash equivalents of $7,571m, fixed deposits of $3,927m less overdrafts of $137m at 31 December 2011, the Group has committed bank facilities of $3.6bn available to manage liquidity.
At 31 December 2011, the Group has issued $1,505m under a Euro Medium Term Note programme and $7,602m under a SEC-registered programme.
The Group regularly monitors the credit standing of the banking group and currently does not anticipate any issue with drawing on the committed facilities should this be necessary.
The committed facilities of$3.6bn mature in October 2012 and were undrawn at 31December 2011.
The maturity profile of the anticipated future contractual cash flows including interest in relation to the Groups financial liabilities, on an undiscounted basis and which, therefore, differs from both the carrying value and fair value, is as follows: Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative derivative and other and other financial Interest Currency financial loans Bonds payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 226 2,267 8,975 11,468 117 117 11,351 In one to two years 422 385 807 84 84 723 In two to three years 1,152 1,152 67 67 1,085 In three to four years 1,352 1,352 49 49 1,303 In four to five years 332 332 49 49 283 In more than five years 9,764 9,764 137 137 9,627 226 15,289 9,360 24,875 503 503 24,372 Effect of interest 5 6,490 6,495 503 503 5,992 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 308 308 362 362 54 31 December 2011 221 9,107 9,360 18,688 362 362 18,326 Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative derivative and other and other financial Interest Currency financial loans Bonds payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 128 518 8,640 9,286 120 120 9,166 In one to two years 2,268 373 2,641 121 121 2,520 In two to three years 423 423 87 87 336 In three to four years 1,153 1,153 69 69 1,084 In four to five years 1,379 1,379 50 50 1,329 In more than five years 10,095 10,095 192 192 9,903 128 15,836 9,013 24,977 639 639 24,338 Effect of interest 3 7,012 7,015 639 639 6,376 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 273 273 324 324 51 31 December 2010 125 9,097 9,013 18,235 324 324 17,911 Bank Total Total overdrafts Trade non-derivative derivative and other and other financial Interest Currency financial loans Bonds payables instruments rate swaps swaps instruments Total $m $m $m $m $m $m $m $m Within one year 139 2,373 8,687 11,199 117 89 28 11,171 In one to two years 523 185 708 117 117 591 In two to three years 2,246 2,246 116 116 2,130 In three to four years 429 429 86 86 343 In four to five years 405 405 64 64 341 In more than five years 12,209 12,209 239 239 11,970 139 18,185 8,872 27,196 739 89 650 26,546 Effect of interest 3 7,467 7,470 739 739 6,731 Effect of discounting, fair values and issue costs 209 209 262 1 261 52 31 December 2009 136 10,927 8,872 19,935 262 90 172 19,763 172 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Where interest payments are on a floating rate basis, it is assumed that rates will remain unchanged from the last business day of each year ended 31 December.
It is not expected that the cash flows in the maturity profile could occur significantly earlier or at significantly different amounts.
Market risk Interest rate risk The Group maintains a mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The portion of fixed rate debt was approved by the Board and any variation requires Board approval.
A significant portion of the long-term debt entered into in 2007 in order to finance the acquisition of MedImmune has been held at fixed rates of interest.
The Group uses interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to manage this mix.
At 31 December 2011, the Group held interest rate swaps with a notional value of $2.5bn, converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2014, and the 7% guaranteed debentures payable in 2023 to floating rates and partially converting the 5.4% callable bond maturing in 2012 and the 5.9% callable bond maturing in 2017 to floating rates.
No new interest rate swaps were entered into during 2011 or 2010.
At 31 December 2011 swaps with a notional value of $1.5bn were designated as fair value hedges and swaps with a notional value of $1.0bn related to debt designated asfair value through profit or loss.
Designated hedges are expected to be effective and therefore the impact of ineffectiveness on profit is not expected to be material.
The accounting treatment for fair value hedges and debt designated as fair value through profit or loss is disclosed in the Group Accounting Policies section from page 146.
The majority of surplus cash is currently invested in US Treasury liquidity funds and direct purchases of US Treasury bills earning floating rates of interest.
Aportion of US Treasury bills have a maturity of greater than 3 months at inception for improved yield.
The interest rate profile of the Groups interest-bearing financial instruments, as at 31 December 2011, 31 December 2010 and 31December 2009 is set out below.
In the case of current and non-current financial liabilities, the classification includes the impact of interest rate swaps which convert the debt to floating rate.
Foreign currency risk The US dollar is the Groups most significant currency.
As a consequence, the Group results are presented in US dollars and exposures are managed against US dollars accordingly.
Translational Approximately 60% of Group external sales in 2011 were denominated in currencies other than the US dollar, while a significant proportion of manufacturing and research and development costs were denominated in pounds sterling and Swedish krona.
Surplus cash generated by business units is substantially converted to, and held centrally in, US dollars.
As a result, operating profit and total cash flow in US dollars will be affected by movements in exchange rates.
This currency exposure is managed centrally based on forecast cash flows including the principal currencies of Swedish krona SEK, pounds sterling GBP, euro EUR, Australian dollar AUD, Canadian dollar CAD, Japanese yen JPY, Romanian leu RON and Russian ruble RUB.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is mitigated significantly by the correlations which exist between the major currencies to which the Group is exposed and the US dollar.
Monitoring of currency exposures and correlations is undertaken on a regular basis and hedging is subject to pre-execution approval.
Where there is non-US dollar debt and an underlying net investment of that amount in the same currency, the Group applies net investment hedging.
As at 31 December 2011, 5.7% of interest-bearing loans and borrowings were denominated in pounds sterling and 10.4% of interestbearing loans and borrowings were denominated in euros.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of debt designated as net investment hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective.
Any ineffectiveness is taken toprofit.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings not designated in a hedge relationship are taken to profit.
Transactional One hundred percent of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged, where practicable, using forward foreign exchange contracts against individual Group companies reporting currency.
In addition, the Groups external dividend, which is paid principally in pounds sterling and Swedish krona, is fully hedged from announcement to payment date.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on forward contracts transacted for transactional hedging are taken to profit.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 173 Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued The table below sets out the principal foreign exchange contracts outstanding at 31 December 2011, 31 December 2010 and 31 December 2009 along with the underlying gross exposure as defined above.
Sensitivity analysis The sensitivity analysis set out below summarises the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to hypothetical changes in market rates and prices.
The range of variables chosen for the sensitivity analysis reflects our view of changes which are reasonably possible over a one-year period.
Market values are the present value of future cash flows based on market rates and prices at the valuation date.
Forlong-term debt, an increase in interest rates results in a decline in the fair value of debt.
The sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous 100 basis point change in interest rates in all currencies from their levels at 31 December 2011, with all other variables held constant.
Based on the composition of our long-term debt portfolio as at 31 December 2011, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in an additional $31m in interest expense being incurred per year.
The exchange rate sensitivity analysis assumes aninstantaneous 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels at 31 December 2011, with all other variables held constant.
The 10% case assumes a 10% strengthening of the US dollar against all other currencies and the -10% case assumes a 10% weakening of the US dollar.
Each incremental 10% movement in foreign currency exchange rates would have approximately the same effect as the initial 10% detailed in the table below and each 1% change in interest rates would have approximately the same effect as the 1% detailed in the table below.

Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk on financial assets, such as cash balances including fixed deposits and cash and cash equivalents, derivative instruments, trade and other receivables.
The Group is also exposed in its net asset position to its own credit risk in respect of the2023 debentures and 2014 bonds which are accounted for at fair value through profit and loss.
174 Financial Statements AstraZeneca Annual Report and Form 20-F Information 2011 Financial Statements 23 Financial risk management objectives and policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate for the customer.
The Group is exposed to customers ranging from government-backed agencies and large private wholesalers to privately owned pharmacies, and the underlying local economic and sovereign risks vary throughout the world.
Where appropriate, the Group endeavours to minimise risks by the use of trade finance instruments such as letters of credit and insurance.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of specific trade and other receivables where it is deemed that a receivable may not be recoverable.
When the debt is deemed irrecoverable, the allowance account is written off against the underlying receivable.
In the US, sales to three wholesalers accounted for approximately 75% of US sales 2010: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 73%: 2009: three wholesalers accounted for approximately 81%.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2011 2010 2009 $m $m $m Not past due 6,249 5,953 5,542 Overdue but renegotiated Past due 0-90 days 177 104 65 Past due 90-180 days 82 67 75 Past due 180 days 122 123 100 6,630 6,247 5,782 2011 2010 2009 $m $m $m Movements in provisions for trade receivables Balance at beginning of year 81 81 99 Income statement credit 10 1 20 Amounts utilised, exchange and other movements 5 1 2 Balance at end of year 66 81 81 The allowance for impairment has been calculated based on past experience and is in relation to specific customers.
Given the profile of our customers, including large wholesalers and government-backed agencies, no further credit risk has been identified with the trade receivables not past due other than those balances for which an allowance has been made.
Other financial assets The Group may hold significant cash balances as part of its normal operations, with the amount of cash held at any point reflecting the level of cash flow generated by the business and the timing of the use of that cash.
The majority of excess cash is centralised within the Group treasury entity and is subject to counterparty risk on the principal invested.
This risk is mitigated through a policy of prioritising security and liquidity over return, and as such cash is only invested in high credit quality investments.
Counterparty limits are set according to the assessed risk of each counterparty and exposures are monitored against these limits on a regular basis.
The majority of the Groups cash is invested in AAA-rated treasury liquidity funds, US Treasury bills and short-term bank deposits.
The most significant concentration of financial credit risk at 31 December 2011 was $5,844m invested in three US AAA-rated Treasury funds and $4,015m invested in US Treasury bills.
The liquidity fund portfolios are managed by the related external third party fund managers to maintain the AAA rating.
No more than 15% of fund value is invested within each individual fund.
US Treasury bills bear credit exposure to the US government.
There were no other significant concentrations of financial credit risk at the reporting date.
All financial derivatives are transacted with commercial banks, in line with standard market practice.
The Group has agreements with some bank counterparties whereby the parties agree to post cash collateral, for the benefit of the other, equivalent to the market valuation of the derivative positions above a predetermined threshold.
The carrying value of such cash collateral held by the Group at 31 December 2011 was $21m.

Research and development collaboration payments The Group has various ongoing collaborations including in-licensing and similar arrangements with development partners.
Such collaborations may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, launch or revenue milestones although the Group generally has the right to terminate these agreements at no cost.
The Group recognises research and development milestones as intangible assets once it is committed to payment, which is generally when the Group reaches set trigger points in the development cycle.
Revenue-related milestones are recognised as intangible assets on product launch at a value based on the Groups long-term revenue forecasts for the related product.
The table below indicates potential development and revenue-related payments that the Group may be required to make under such collaborations.

Revenue-related milestone payments represent the maximum possible amount payable on achievement of specified levels of revenue as set out in individual contract agreements, but exclude variable payments that are based on unit sales eg royalty-type payments which are recognised as the associated sale is recognised in thecomprehensive income statement.
The table excludes any payments already capitalised in the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 and excludes payments under the Merck agreements detailed below.
The future payments we disclose represent contracted payments and, as such, are not discounted and are not risk adjusted.
As detailed in the Principal risks and uncertainties section from page 130, the development of any pharmaceutical product candidate is a complex and risky process that may fail at any stage in the development process due to a number of factors including items such as failure to obtain regulatory approval, unfavourable data from key studies, adverse reactions to the product candidate or indications of other safety concerns.
The timing of the payments is based on the Groups current best estimate of achievement of the relevant milestone.
Arrangements with Merck Annual contingent payments Introduction AstraZeneca makes ongoing payments to Merck based on sales In 1982, Astra AB set up a joint venture with Merck & Co. Inc. now ofcertain of its products in the US the contingent payments on Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. a subsidiary of the new Merck & Co. Inc. theagreement products.
Contingent payments in respect of that resulted from the merger with Schering-Plough Merck for the Prilosec and Nexium will continue until the Second Option is exercised purposes of selling, marketing and distributing certain Astra products and consummated as discussed under Second Option below.
In 1998, this joint venture was restructured Restructuring.

Merck relinquished all rights, including First Option including Entocort, Atacand, Plendil and the authorised contingent payments on future sales, to potential Astra products with generic version of felodipine, and certain products then still in no existing or pending US patents at the time of the merger.
As a result, development principally Brilinta and lesogaberan.

Contingent payments on the authorised generic version of felodipine will continue until AstraZenecas third party distribution At the time of the merger, the Advance Payment was paid.
It was calculated as the then net present value of $2.8bn discounted from arrangement ends, which is currently expected to occur in June 2012.
As detailed in Note 9, the intangible asset relating to lesogaberan of 2008 to the date of merger at a rate of 13% per annum and amounted to $967m.
It was subject to a true-up in 2008 as discussed under $128m was subsequently impaired to a value of nil following a decision to terminate further development of this compound.
Second Option Partial Retirement In March 2008, there was a partial retirement of Mercks limited AstraZeneca may exercise a Second Option to purchase Mercks interests in the Merck affiliates that hold the limited partner and other partnership interest by payment to Merck of an amount calculated asa multiple of the average annual contingent payments from 2005 to rights referred to above.
Exercise of the Second Option would result in the repurchase by AstraZeneca of Mercks interests in Prilosec and 2007 on the relevant products, plus $750m.
This option is exercisable by AstraZeneca in May to October of 2012, or in 2017, or if combined annual sales of the two Upon the Partial Retirement, Mercks rights in respect of certain of the agreement products ended.
The products covered by the Partial products fall below a minimum amount.
If AstraZeneca exercises the Second Option, consummation of the transaction will occur five to six Retirement include Toprol-XL, Pulmicort, Rhinocort and Symbicort.
AstraZenecas consummation of the Second Option will end the contingent payments in respect of Prilosec and Nexium and True-Up In 2008, in accordance with the Agreements, there was a True-Up of will effectively end AstraZenecas relationship with, and obligations to, Merck other than some residual manufacturing arrangements.
The True-Up amount was based on a multiple of the average annual contingent payments from 2005 to 2007 in InSeptember 2010, AstraZeneca and Merck reached an agreement with respect to the treatment of Vimovo under the Agreements, respect of all the agreement products with the exception of Prilosec and Nexium subject to a minimum of $6.6bn, plus other defined amounts pursuant to which AstraZeneca will pay Merck certain amounts with respect to Vimovo only if it exercises the Second Option and as part totalling $912m.

In 2008, at the same time as the settlement of the Partial Partnership for the prior three years.
The exercise price of the Second Option cannot be determined at this time.
Retirement and the True-Up, Merck settled the loan note receivable by paying AstraZeneca $1.38bn.
Accounting treatment of termination arrangements If Merck had exercised the First Option in 2008, the net minimum AstraZeneca considers that the termination arrangements described above represent the acquisition, in stages, of Mercks interests in payment that would have been made to Merck would have been $3.3bn, being the minimum combined payments of $4.7bn specified in the thePartnership and agreement products including Mercks rights to contingent payments and depend, in part, on the exercise of the First Agreements on the Partial Retirement, the True-Up and First Option, less the repayment of the loan note of $1.38bn.
In accounting for the and Second Options.
The effects will only be reflected in the financial statements as these stages are reached.
If and when all such payments Restructuring in 1998, the loan note was included in the determination of the fair values of the assets and liabilities to be acquired.
At that time, are made, AstraZeneca will have unencumbered discretion in its operations in the US market.
the loan note was ascribed a fair value of zero on acquisition and on the balance sheet, because it was estimated that the net minimum AstraZeneca anticipates that the benefits that accrue under all of the payment of $3.3bn equated to the fair value of the rights to be acquired under the Partial Retirement, True-Up and First Option.
termination arrangements arise: First Option Currently, from the substantial freedom over products acquired or discovered post-merger.
In accordance with the Agreements, in 2008 a calculation was made of the Appraised Value, being the net present value of the future contingent On occurrence of each stage of such arrangements, from enhanced contributions from, and substantial freedom over, those products payments in respect of all agreement products not covered by the Partial Retirement, other than Prilosec and Nexium.
The Appraised that have already been launched for example, Prilosec, Nexium, Brilinta, Pulmicort, Symbicort, Rhinocort and Atacand, and those Value was calculated in 2008 as $647m.
Payment of the Appraised Value to Merck in March 2008 would have taken place only if Merck had exercised the First Option in 2008.
Merck Economic benefits include relief from contingent payments, anticipated cost savings from cessation of manufacturing arrangements and other did not exercise this option.
