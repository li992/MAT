55 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Accounts Notes to the Accounts 1 Segmental analysis The Board regularly reviews the Groups performance and balance sheet position for its entire operations, which are based in the UK, and receives financial information for the UK as a whole.
As a consequence the Group has one reportable segment which is UK housebuilding.
As there continues to be only one reportable segment whose revenue, profits, expenses, assets, liabilities and cash flows are measured and reported on a basis consistent with the Group financial statements, no additional numerical disclosures are necessary.
Additional information on average selling prices and the unit sales split between north, south, private and social has been included in the Group Finance Directors Review on pages 20 to 23.
The Board does not, however, consider these categories to be separate reportable segments as they review the entire operations as a whole, which are based in the UK, when assessing performance and making decisions about the allocation ofresources.

5 Exceptional items Exceptional items are those which, in the opinion of the Board, are material by size or nature, non-recurring, and of such significance that they require separate disclosure on the face of the income statement.
A full review of inventories was performed at 31 July 2011 and the carrying value of land was compared to the net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less all estimated costs of completion and attributable overheads.
Estimated selling prices were reviewed on a site-by-site basis and selling prices were amended based on local management and the Boards assessment of current market conditions.
No exceptional land write downs or land write backs were required as a result of this review.
There were no exceptional items in the year ended 31 July 2010.

The Chancellor has also proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by one per cent per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014, but these changes were not substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not included in the figures above.
The effective income tax charge is 25.3% of profit before tax 2010 19.4% and compares favourably to the Groups standard tax rate for the year of 27.3% 2010 28.0%.
The lower effective tax rate in the current year is principally due to finalisation of prior year land remediation claims.

8 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the weighted average number of ordinary shares held by the employee share ownership plans which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share uses the same earnings figure as the basic calculation except that the weighted average number of shares has been adjusted to reflect the dilutive effect of outstanding share options allocated under employee share schemes where the market value exceeds the option price.
It is assumed that all dilutive potential ordinary shares are converted at the beginning of the accounting period.
Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing earnings by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are outlined below: Earnings Weighted Earnings Earnings Weighted Earnings average per share average number per share number of of ordinary shares ordinary shares 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 000 no.

In the ordinary course of business inventories have been written down by a net 5.0 million 2010 4.4 million in the year.
There has been no exceptional write down of inventories in the period 2010 nil as outlined in note 5 on page 56.
Land with a carrying value of 20.5 million 2010 26.6 million was used as security for land payables note 17.
The directors consider all inventories to be essentially current in nature although the Groups operational cycle is such that a proportion of inventories will not be realised within 12 months.
It is not possible to determine with accuracy when specific inventory will be realised as this is subjectto a number of issues including consumer demand and planning permission delays.
The Company has no inventory.

Other financial assets comprise loans, largely with non-fixed repayment dates and variable repayment amounts, provided as part of sales transactions that are secured by way of a second legal charge on the related property.
The assets are recorded at fair value, being the estimated amount receivable by the Group, discounted to present day values.
The fair value of future anticipated cash receipts takes into account the directors view of future house price movements, the expected timing of receipts and the likelihood that a purchaser defaults on a repayment.
The directors revisit the future anticipated cash receipts from the assets at the end of each reporting period.
The difference between the anticipated future receipt and the initial fair value is credited charged over the estimated deferred term to cost of sales, with the financial asset increasing to its full expected cash settlement value on the anticipated receipt date.
The imputed interest charged to cost of sales for the year ended 31 July 2011 was 4.574 million 2010 2.024 million credit.
Credit risk, which the directors currently consider to be largely mitigated through holding a second legal charge over the assets, is accounted for in determining present values.
The directors review the financial assets for impairment at the end of each reporting period.
There were no indicators ofimpairment at 31 July 2011 2010 nil.
None of the other financial assets are past their due dates 2010 nil.
At initial recognition, the fair value of the assets is calculated using a discount rate, appropriate to the class of assets, which reflects market conditions at the date of entering into the transaction.
The directors consider at the end of each reporting period whether the initial market discount rate still reflects up to date market conditions.
If a revision is required, the fair value of the asset is re-measured at the present value of the revised future cash flows using this revised discount rate: the difference between this value and the carrying value of the asset is recorded against the carrying value of the asset and recognised directly in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The directors considered that there was no material difference between the initial market discount rate and the market discount rate at 31 July 2011 or 31 July 2010 and accordingly have not recognised any movements directly within the Statement of Comprehensive Income to date.
The Company has no other financial assets.

18 Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, bank loans and overdrafts and various items such as trade receivables, other financial assets and trade payables that arise directly from its operations.
The main objective of the Groups policy towards financial instruments is to maximise returns on the Groups cash balances, manage the Groups working capital requirements and finance the Groups ongoing operations.
The Companys only financial instruments are cash and preference shares.
Capital Management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong capital base to underpin the future development of the business in order to deliver value to shareholders.
The Group finances its operations through retained earnings, bank borrowings and the management of working capital.
From time to time, the trustees of the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 the Trust also purchase shares for the future satisfaction of employee share options.
Management of financial risk The main risks associated with the Groups financial instruments have been identified as credit risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
The Board is responsible for managing these risks and the policies adopted, which have remained largely unchanged during the year, are set out below.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk is limited by the fact that the Group generally receives cash at the point of legal completion of its sales.
There is no specific concentration of credit risk in respect of home sales as the exposure is spread over a number of customers.
In respect of trade receivables and other financial assets, the amounts presented in the balance sheet are stated after adjusting for any doubtful receivables, based on the judgement of the Groups management through using both previous experience and knowledge of the current position see note 15.
In managing risk the Group assesses the credit risk of its counterparties before entering into a transaction.
No credit limits were exceeded during the reporting period or subsequently and the Group does not anticipate any losses from non-performance by these counterparties.
In relation to land payables, certain payables are secured on the respective land asset held see note 17.
No other security is held against any other financial assets of the Group.
The Board considers the Groups exposure to credit risk to be acceptable and normal for an entity of its size given the industry in which it operates.
Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report and Accounts 2011 66 Business Review Governance Accounts Other Information Accounts Notes to the Accounts continued 18 Financial risk management continued Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings and debt comprising bank overdraft facilities and borrowings.
The Group manages its liquidity risk by monitoring existing facilities and cash flows against forecast requirements based on a two year rolling cash forecast.
The Groups banking arrangements outlined below are considered to be adequate in terms of flexibility and liquidity for its medium-term cash flow needs therefore mitigating the Groups liquidity risk.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk reflects the Groups exposure to fluctuations to interest rates in the market.
The risk arises because the Groups overdraft and floating rate bank loans bear interest based on either LIBOR or the Bank of England base rate.
For the year ended 31 July 2011 it is estimated that an increase of 1% in interest rates applying for the full year would decrease the Groups profit before tax by 0.057 million 2010 increase the Groups profit before tax by 0.4 million.
Housing market risk The Group is affected by movements in UK house prices.
These in turn are affected by factors such as credit availability, employment levels, interest rates, consumer confidence and supply of land with planning.
Whilst it is not possible for the Group to fully mitigate housing market risk on a national macroeconomic basis the Group does continually monitor itsgeographical spread within the UK, seeking to balance investment in areas offering the best immediate returns with a long-term spread of its operations throughout the UK to minimise the effect of local microeconomic fluctuations.
Land purchased on deferred terms The Group sometimes acquires land on deferred payment terms.
In accordance with IAS 39 the deferred creditor is recorded at fair value being the price paid for the land discounted to present day.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the deferred term to finance expenses, increasing the land creditor to its full cash settlement value on the payment date.
The maturity profile of the total contracted cash payments in respect of amounts due on land creditors at the balance sheet date is as follows: Balance at Total Within one 12 years 25 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 At 31 July 2011 83,207 86,547 58,165 21,336 5,809 1,237 At 31 July 2010 61,853 65,818 45,790 7,874 7,064 5,090 The maturity profile of the total contracted payments in respect of financial liabilities excluding amounts due on land creditors shown separately above is as follows: Balance at Total Within one 12 years 25 years More than 31 July contracted year or on 5 years cash payment demand 000 000 000 000 000 000 Bank loans floating rates 80,000 82,441 15,990 25,780 40,671 Preference shares 20,000 25,700 1,900 1,900 21,900 Trade and other payables 114,752 114,752 109,970 4,782 At 31 July 2011 214,752 222,893 127,860 27,680 62,571 4,782 Bank loans floating rates 80,000 83,480 1,030 15,990 66,460 Preference shares 20,000 27,600 1,900 1,900 23,800 Trade and other payables 91,883 91,883 89,049 2,834 At 31 July 2010 191,883 202,963 91,979 17,890 90,260 2,834 The interest rates on the preference shares apply to the whole term of the relevant instruments.
The imputed interest rate on land payables reflects market interest rates available to the Group on floating rate bank loans at the time of acquiring the land.
At the year end, the Group had 210.0 million 2010 225.0 million of undrawn bank facilities available.
The Companys only financial liabilities are preference shares as disclosed in the maturity profile above.

Expected long-term rates of return The expected long-term return on cash is related to bank base rates at the balance sheet date.
The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities has been determined by setting anappropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
The expected long-term rates of return are as follows: Period Period commencing commencing 1 August 1 August 2010 2009 % per annum % per annum Equities 5.70 7.50 Bonds 5.10 5.65 Cash 4.20 4.50 Overall for Scheme 5.48 6.61 Actual return on Scheme assets The actual return on the Scheme assets over the year ended 31 July 2011 was 12.80% 31 July 2010 16.97%.

The tables used imply the following life expectancies at age 65: Male retiring at age 65 in 2011 23.2 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2011 25.7 years Male retiring at age 65 in 2031 25.2 years Female retiring at age 65 in 2031 27.6 years With effect from 1 January 2011 the UK Government changed the basis for both statutory revaluation of pension scheme benefits and increases topensions under defined benefit pension schemes, from RPI to CPI measures.
Where this change affects the future obligations under the Scheme, the change has been accounted for as a change in the financial assumptions used to measure the defined benefit obligation.

IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP have been made to executive directors and the Group Company Secretary, with awards under the annual bonus scheme also made to senior employees.
The awards take the form of ordinary shares in the Company.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 ESOS have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to employees in May 2006.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2005 Employee Share Option Scheme 2005 ESOS replaces the 1995 ESOS.
Awards may be granted on a discretionary basis to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors and are subject to performance conditions.
The Bellway p. l. c. 2007 Employee Share Option Scheme 2007 ESOS replaces the 1996 ESOS.
It is an unapproved discretionary scheme which provides for the grant of options over ordinary shares to employees and executive directors.
It is, however, the current intention that no executive directors of the Company should be granted options under the scheme.
Awards will be available to vest after three years, subject to objective performance targets.
Options issued under the SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
An outline of the performance conditions in relation to the above Schemes is detailed under the long-term incentive scheme section on pages 38 and 41 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
For awards made prior to 16 January 2008, vesting of awards under the LTIP is dependent upon total shareholder return of the Group measured against relevant comparator companies as detailed on page 41 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
For awards made on16January 2008, vesting of awards is dependent upon two conditions, total shareholder return and return on capital employed.
For awards madeon 4 November 2008, 29 October 2009 and 21 October 2010, vesting of awards is dependent only on total shareholder return as detailed onpage 41 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
With regard to the annual bonus scheme, for awards up to and including those for the year ended 31 July 2006, one half was payable in November each year following the announcement of the Groups annual results.
The other half was used to acquire Bellway shares at the prevailing market value.
These shares are held in the Bellway Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
In addition, various small share awards were made for years 2003 through to 2007 to employees, mainly at divisional management level.
Theseawards mainly had three year vesting periods.
Awards to executive directors and to the Group Company Secretary in relation to the year ended 31July 2007, and subsequent years, are made in cash with no compulsory deferral element.
Share-based payments have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data atthe time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the year was 675.6p 2010 681.3p.
Valuation methodology For the LTIP, a Monte Carlo simulation method is used which allows the Groups performance, in terms of total shareholder return, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities are calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, is also used.
In the case of the deferred element of the annual bonus, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award and no dividends are credited to the individual.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
For the 1995, 1996, 2005 and 2007 ESOSs, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
