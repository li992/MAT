Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Financial instruments Financial instruments in the scope of FRS 26 are classified as either financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, or available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
Financial liabilities in the scope of FRS 26 are classified as financial liabilities at amortised cost borrowings, amounts owed to subsidiaries and other creditors.
When financial instruments are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, and in the case of investments not at fair value through profit or loss, after taking account of directly attributable transaction costs.
All bank and other loans are initially recognised at fair value, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the loans.
After initial recognition, bank and other loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and redemption value is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less or to receive more, tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for taxable gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period on which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Share-based payments Where a parent company grants rights to its equity instruments to employees of a subsidiary, and such share-based compensation is accounted for as equity-settled in the consolidated financial statements of the parent, the subsidiary is required to record an expense for such compensation in accordance with FRS 20 Share-based payments, with a corresponding increase recognised in equity as a contribution from the parent.
Consequently, the Company has recognised an addition to investments in subsidiaries of the aggregate amount of these contributions that accrued in the year of 5.0m 2010: 3.2m with a corresponding credit to equity shareholders funds.
Full details of share-based payments transactions are provided in Note 28 of the Group financial statements.
