Staff share schemes: Analysis of share scheme costs per income statement : 31 December 31 December 2011 2010 m m SIP charge note i 6.0 5.1 DFSS charge note ii 12.6 9.9 Total share scheme charges 18.6 15.0 The share scheme charges reported above are net of the co-insurance share and therefore differ from the gross charge reported in note 10 2011: 23.6m, 2010: 18.5m and the gross credit to reserves reported in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
The consolidated cashflow statement also shows the gross charge in the reconciliation between profit after tax and cashflows from operating activities.
The co-insurance share of the charge is included in the change in trade and other payables line.
i The Approved Share Incentive Plan the SIP : Eligible employees qualify for awards under the SIP based upon the performance of the Group in each half-year period.
The current maximum award for each year is 3,000 per employee.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against prior year profit before tax.
Employees must remain in employment for the holding period 3 years from the date of award otherwise the shares are forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
Admiral Group plc Annual Report 2011 78 ii The Discretionary Free Share Scheme the DFSS : Under the DFSS, details of which are contained in the Remuneration policy section of the Remuneration report, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order to receive shares.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2011 scheme is 1,791,234 2010 scheme: 1,662,303.
Individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the same three-year period.
For the 2011 and 2010 schemes, 50% of the shares awarded at the start of the three year vesting period are subject to these performance conditions.
The range of awards is as follows: If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest: EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests: and To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the 3-year period.
Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the DFSS are not eligible for dividends although a discretionary bonus is currently paid equivalent to the dividend that would have been paid on the respective shareholding and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made as stated in the Remuneration report.
