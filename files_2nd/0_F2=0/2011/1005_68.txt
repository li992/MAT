48 Accounts Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 4.2 Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies Areas of judgement that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are: a Classification of mining and exploration interests note 2.9 and note 19. b Classification of royalty instruments and royalty interests.
The directors review each royalty acquired to determine whether there is a contractual right to receive cash which would meet the definition of a financial asset, or if the royalty receivable for the interest acquired is derived from the rights attached to the underlying asset mineral resource.
In the latter case these are treated as an intangible asset note 2.7 b and note 18.
Where a royalty agreement contains a convertible option within it, the contracts are reviewed to determine whether the assets should be classified as a derivative at fair value through profit or loss or can be classified as an available for sale financial asset with an embedded derivative note 2.9 and note 17. c Classification of the Groups investment in Royalco Resources Limited as available for sale mining and exploration interest note 19a.
d Review of assumptions underlying the independent coal industry advisors valuation of the Kestrel and Crinum coal royalty note 16. e Review of assumptions underlying the valuation of royalty instruments and their associated embedded derivatives note 17.
The directors review the latest available mine plans and obtain independent foreign exchange and commodity price forecasts to determine each of the royalty instruments carrying value at reporting date.
f Review of asset carrying values and impairment charges and reversals note 2.6, note 2.7, note 2.8, note 16, note 17, note 18 and note 19.
The directors expect that Empire Mining Corp will satisfactorily resolve the licensing of the Bulqiza chromite project in Albania, and therefore, have not impaired the 3% gross revenue royalty the Group holds over this project.
g Recognition of deferred tax liabilities and the continued application of relevant exemptions note 2.10, note 11 and note 23. h Treatment of unrealised losses on mining and exploration interests note 19.
The directors review the fair value of all quoted mining and exploration interests in light of market conditions and assess unrealised losses as either permanent or temporary in nature.
As at December 31, 2011 the Groups unrealised losses resulted in a negative investment revaluation reserve of 4.8 million.
The directors consider these losses to be temporary in nature and therefore, the movement in fair value has been recognised directly in equity through the investment revaluation reserve.
5 Segment information Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Committee considers the Groups undertakings from a business perspective.
This has resulted in the Group being organised into two operating segments royalties and mining and exploration interests.
The royalties segment encompasses all Group activities relating directly to the royalties received from mining operations.
The mining and exploration interests segment encompasses all Group activities relating directly to the acquisition, disposal and continued monitoring of the Groups investments in listed and unlisted entities operating in mining and mineral exploration.
