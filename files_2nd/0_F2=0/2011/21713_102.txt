BlueCrest AllBlue Fund Limited the Company NOTICE OF GENERAL MEETING continued Special Resolutions Resolution 9: Disapplication of pre-emption rights Article 12.2 of the Articles of Incorporation requires that where Ordinary Shares are issued, or rights to subscribe for, or convert any securities into, Ordinary Shares are granted, wholly for cash, or where Ordinary Shares are sold out of treasury wholly for cash, either shareholder approval must be sought to make a non-pre-emptive offer or a preemptive offer must be made to all existing shareholders but allowing the directors to make such provision as they think fit in relation to fractional entitlements and or certain overseas shareholders and or any other matters.
The Board believes that the ability to issue new Ordinary Shares on a non-pre-emptive basis is in the best interests of the Company as this affords considerable flexibility and a significant reduction in time and costs in effecting fundraisings.
If approved, the disapplication authority will allow the Board to issue up to a maximum number of 500,000,000 Ordinary Shares.
The authority sought under this Resolution will expire on 31 December 2013, unless such resolution is previously revoked by the Companys shareholders in general meeting.
