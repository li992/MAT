The consolidated financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 24 February 2012.

The accounting policies set out below have been consistently applied to both periods presented, unless otherwise stated.
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost basis.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements are in accordance with Adopted IFRSs and are the same as those applied by the Group in its consolidated financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2011.

Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Judgments and estimates The preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with Adopted IFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods, if applicable.
In particular, information about significant areas of estimation uncertainty and critical judgments in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements is included in the following notes: Note 21 Deferred tax assets relating to the rate at which the asset will reverse and the recoverability of the asset Note 24 Measur ement of share-based payments relating to the inputs to the fair value models and the estimate of the number of shares that will eventually be issued 2 Significant accounting policies a Investments Investments in subsidiaries are held at cost less any provision for impairment in the Parent Company financial statements.
b Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase method.
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to this date goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount previously recorded under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP.
The classification and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 were not reconsidered in preparing the Groups opening IFRS statement of financial position at 1 January 2004.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment.
This applies to all goodwill arising both before and after 1 January 2004.
52 business r business review eview corporate gover corporate governance finance financial statements rightmove plc annual report 2011 2 Significant accounting policies continued ii Research and development The Group undertakes research and development expenditure in view of developing new products and improving the existing property websites.
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of a new product or substantially enhanced website, is capitalised if the new product or the enhanced website is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes subcontractors and direct labour.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only when it increases the economic benefits embodied in the specific asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure is expensed when incurred.
iii Computer software and licenses Computer software and externally acquired software licenses are capitalised and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
Amortisation is charged from the date the asset is available for use.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of the computer software or license by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life as follows: Computer software 16.7% 33.3% per annum Software licences 20.0% 33.3% per annum iv Customer relationships Customer relationships are identified on the acquisition of a business and valued using discounted cash flows based on historical customer attrition rates.
Amortisation is expensed in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful economic life as follows: Customer relationships 16.7% per annum c Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Office equipment, fixtures & fittings 20.0% per annum Computer equipment 20.0% 33.3% per annum Leasehold improvements life of the lease d Impairment The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of non-financial assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash flows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that they might be impaired.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
co. uk notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Investments are assessed for possible impairment when there is an indication that the fair value of the investments may be below the Companys carrying value.
When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value and the amount written off is included in profit or loss.
In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the Company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investees financial performance and the Companys ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investments market value.
e Financial instruments Trade receivables are recognised at fair value less any impairment loss.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
Inter-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from inter-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Trade payables are recognised at fair value.
Trade payables are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting date.
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with borrowings.
After initial recognition, loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost and any difference between the proceeds and the redemption value is recognised in profit or loss over the term of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
f Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with original maturities of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
g Employee benefits i Pensions The Group provides access to a stakeholder pension scheme a defined contribution pension plan into which employees may elect to contribute via salary deduction.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in profit or loss when they are due.
ii Employee share schemes The Group provides share-based incentive plans allowing certain senior management to acquire shares in the Company.
An expense is recognised in profit or loss, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period to which the employees become unconditionally entitled, on equity settled share-based incentive schemes granted after 7 November 2002 and which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
Fair value is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
Measurement inputs include share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility based on weighted average historic volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information, weighted average expected life of the instruments based on historical experience and general option behaviour, expected dividends, and risk-free interest rates based on government bonds.
Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the awards are not taken into account in determining the fair value.
For share-based incentive awards with non-vesting conditions, the grant date fair value of the share-based incentives is measured to reflect such conditions and there is no true-up for differences between expected and actual outcomes.
When either the employee or the Company chooses not to meet the non-vesting condition the failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation and the cost that would have been recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
iii Own shares held by The Rightmove Employees Share Trust EBT The EBT is treated as an agent of Rightmove Group Limited and as such EBT transactions are treated as being those of Rightmove Group Limited and are therefore reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, at a consolidated level, the EBTs purchases of shares in the Company are debited directly to equity.
54 business r business review eview corporate gover corporate governance finance financial statements rightmove plc annual report 2011 2 Significant accounting policies continued h Treasury shares and shares purchased for cancellation When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are either held in treasury or cancelled.
i Revenue Revenue principally represents the amounts, excluding value added tax VAT, receivable from customers in respect of properties advertised on Group websites.
All revenue is recognised in the month to which it relates.
Estate agency and overseas branches are billed in advance with net revenue deferred until the service commencement date.
The VAT liability is recognised at the point of invoice.
New homes developers are typically billed monthly in arrears.
Where invoices are raised on other than a monthly basis, the amounts are recognised as deferred or accrued revenue and released to the income statement on a monthly basis in line with the provision of services as stipulated in the contract terms.
j Segmental reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
An operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the Groups Managing Director to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
k Leases Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where cash is received in exchange for entering into a lease with rates above market value, this upfront payment is deferred and released on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
l Financial income and expenses Financial income comprises interest receivable on cash balances, deposits and dividend income.
Interest income is recognised as it accrues, using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised on the date that the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Financial expenses comprise debt issue costs, interest payable on bank loans and bank charges.
Interest payable is recognised on an accruals basis.
m National Insurance NI on share-based incentives Employers NI is accrued, where applicable, at a rate of 13.8%, which management expects to be the prevailing rate when share-based incentives are exercised.
In the case of share options it is provided on the difference between the share price at the reporting date and the average exercise price of share options.
In the case of performance shares and deferred shares at nil cost, it is provided based on the share price at the reporting date.
n Taxation Income tax on the results for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the period, net of any charge or credit posted directly to equity, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination and the differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the reporting date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In accordance with IAS 12, the Group policy in relation to the recognition of deferred tax on share-based incentives is to include the income tax effect of the tax deduction in profit or loss to the value of the income tax charge on the cumulative IFRS 2 charge.
The remainder of the income tax effect of the tax deduction is recognised in equity.
co. uk notes continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued o Dividends Dividends unpaid at the reporting date are only recognised as a liability and deduction to equity at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
p Earnings per share The Group presents basic, diluted and underlying earnings per share EPS data for its ordinary shares.
Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to equity holders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all potential dilutive instruments, which comprise share-based incentives granted to employees.
The calculation of underlying EPS is disclosed in Note 12. q Discontinued operations A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business or geographical area of operations that has been disposed of or is held for sale or distribution, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
When an operation is classified as a discontinued operation, the comparative statement of comprehensive income is restated as if the operation had been discontinued from the start of the comparative year.
3 IFRSs not yet applied A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2011 and have not been applied in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
None of these are expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
4 Financial risk management Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: credit risk liquidity risk market risk operational risk This note presents information about the Group and Companys exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk and the Groups management of capital.
Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these consolidated financial statements.
The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
The primary method by which risks are monitored and managed by the Group is through the monthly Executive Management Board, where any significant new risks or change in status to existing risks will be discussed and actions taken as appropriate.
The Groups risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor risks and adherence to limits.
Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect changes in market conditions and the Groups activities.
The Group, through its training and management standards and procedures, aims to develop a disciplined and constructive control environment in which all employees understand their roles and obligations.
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Groups internal controls and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group.
56 business r business review eview corporate gover corporate governance finance financial statements rightmove plc annual report 2011 4 Financial risk management continued Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer fails to meet its contractual obligations.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is influenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer.
The Group provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The Group provides its services to a wide range of customers in the UK and overseas and therefore believes it has no material concentration of credit risk.
More than 94.0% of the Groups customers pay via monthly direct debit, minimising the risk of non-payment.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other receivables based on individually identified loss exposures.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulties in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash.
The Group and Companys approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Groups revenue model is largely subscription-based which results in a regular level of cash conversion allowing it to service working capital requirements.
The Group and Company ensure that they have sufficient cash on demand to meet expected operational expenses excluding the potential impact of extreme circumstances that cannot reasonably be predicted, such as natural disasters.
Throughout the year, the Group typically had sufficient cash on demand to meet operational expenses on continuing operations, before financing activities, for a period of 342 days 2010: 296 days.
As at 31 December 2011 the Group had bank borrowings of nil 2010: nil.
Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices such as foreign exchange and interest rates will affect the Groups income.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising the return on risk.
i Currency risk All of the Groups sales and more than 95.0% of the Groups purchases are Sterling denominated, accordingly it has no significant currency risk.
ii Interest rate risk The Group and Company have no interest bearing financial liabilities.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash balances and amounts held in Escrow.
Operational risk Operational risk is the risk of direct or indirect loss arising from a wide variety of causes associated with the Groups processes, personnel, technology and infrastructure, and from external factors other than credit, market and liquidity risks such as those arising from legal and regulatory requirements and generally accepted standards of corporate behaviour.
Operational risks arise from all of the Groups operations.
The Groups objective is to manage operational risk so as to balance the avoidance of financial losses and damage to the Groups reputation with overall cost effectiveness and to avoid control procedures that restrict initiative and creativity.
co. uk notes continued 4 Financial risk management continued The primary responsibility for the development and implementation of controls to address operational risk is assigned to senior management within each business unit.
This responsibility is supported by the development of overall Group standards for the management of operational risk in the following areas: requirements for appropriate segregation of duties, including the independent authorisation of transactions: requirements for the reconciliation and monitoring of transactions: compliance with regulatory and other legal requirements: documentation of controls and procedures: requirements for the periodic assessment of operational risks faced, and the adequacy of controls and procedures to address the risks identified: requirements for reporting of operational losses and proposed remedial action: development and regular testing of contingency plans: training and professional development: and risk mitigation, including insurance where this is effective.
Capital management The Board of directors policy is to maintain an efficient statement of financial position with an appropriate level of leverage for the size of the business so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Board of directors considers that the future working capital and capital expenditure requirements of the Group will continue to be low and accordingly return on capital measures are not key performance targets.
The Board of directors monitors the spread of the Companys shareholders as well as underlying earnings per share.
The Board of directors has a progressive dividend policy and also monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders in relation to profit growth.
The Boards policy is to return surplus capital to shareholders through a combination of dividends and share buy backs.
The Company purchases its own shares in the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market conditions.
There were no changes in the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.
5 Operating segments The Group determines and presents operating segments based on internal information that is provided to the Managing Director, who is the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Groups reportable segments are as follows: The Agency segment which provides resale and lettings property advertising services on www.
co. uk: and The New Homes segment which provides property advertising services to new home developers and Housing Associations on www.
The Other segment which represents activities under the reportable segments threshold, comprises overseas property advertising services on www.
co. uk and non-property advertising services which include business and information services and Automated Valuation Model services.

The 2010 final dividend paid on 10 June 2011 was 9,499,000 being a difference of 35,000 compared to that reported in the 2010 Annual Report, which was due to a reduction in the ordinary shares entitled to a dividend between 31 December 2010 and the final dividend record date of 13 May 2011.
The 2011 interim dividend paid on 11 November 2011 was 7,278,000 being a difference of 28,000 compared to that reported in the 2011 Half Year Report, which was due to a reduction in the ordinary shares entitled to a dividend between 30 June 2011 and the interim dividend record date of 14 October 2011.

co. uk notes continued 21 Deferred tax assets continued On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 28.0% to 26.0% with effect from 1 April 2011, with a further reduction to 25.0% scheduled for 1 April 2012 and proposed changes to further reduce this rate by 1.0% per annum to 23.0% by 1 April 2014.
The first 1.0% reduction with effect from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted for the purposes of IFRS on 5 July 2011.
It has not been possible to quantify the full anticipated effect of the announced further 2.0% rate reduction but it is expected to result in a reduction in the Groups future current tax charge and to reduce the Groups deferred tax assets accordingly, resulting in a charge to income and a debit directly to equity in accordance with the accounting for share-based incentives.
The anticipated changes to the capital allowance rules from April 2012 are considered unlikely to have a material impact on the effective rate of tax.

74 business r business review eview corporate gover corporate governance finance financial statements rightmove plc annual report 2011 24 Share-based payments The Group and Company operate share-based incentive schemes for executive directors and other selected senior management employees.
Since flotation, the Company has awarded share options under the Rightmove Unapproved Executive Share Option Plan Unapproved Plan and the Rightmove Approved Executive Share Option Plan Approved Plan.
The Group also operates a Savings Related Share Option Scheme Sharesave Plan.
Following approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in May 2011, the Rightmove Performance Share Plan PSP was introduced.
The PSP permits awards of nil cost options or contingent shares which will only vest in the event of prior satisfaction of a performance condition.
All share-based incentives are subject to a service condition.
Such conditions are not taken into account in the fair value of the service received.
The fair value of services received in return for share-based incentives is measured by reference to the fair value of share-based incentives granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured using either the Monte Carlo or Black Scholes pricing model as is most appropriate for each scheme.
The total share-based payments charge for the year relating to employee share-based incentive plans was 2,269,000 2010: 1,846,000.
Approved and Unapproved Plans There was no award of executive share options in the year ended 31 December 2011.
Unapproved executive share option awards granted on 5 March 2010 at an exercise price of 6.66 are subject to an equal measure of Total Shareholder Return TSR performance and growth in EPS.
The vesting of 50% of the 2010 award will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three-year performance period and the vesting of the other 50% of the 2010 award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target over a three-year performance period.
Unapproved executive share option awards made on 5 March 2009 are subject to a relative TSR performance over a three-year performance period, relative to the constituents of the FTSE 250.
Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.

76 business r business review eview corporate gover corporate governance finance financial statements rightmove plc annual report 2011 24 Share-based payments continued Sharesave Plan The Group operates an Her Majestys Revenue and Customs approved Sharesave Plan under which employees are granted an option to purchase ordinary shares in the Company at up to 20% less than the market price at invitation, in three years time, dependent on their entering into a contract to make monthly contributions into a savings account over the relevant period.
These funds are used to fund the option exercise.
No performance criteria are applied to the exercise of Sharesave options.
The assumptions used in the measurement of the fair value at grant date of the Sharesave Plan are as follows: Employee turnover before vesting Share price Exercise Expected Risk free Dividend non-vesting Fair value at grant date price volatility Option life rate yield condition per option Grant date pence pence % years % % % pence 2 October 2006 345.75 259.00 27.0 3.25 4.5 3.0 16.0 108.00 3 October 2007 525.00 490.00 32.0 3.25 5.8 1.5 84.0 156.00 2 October 2008 253.75 255.00 32.0 3.25 3.0 1.5 25.0 59.00 1 October 2009 545.00 425.00 50.3 3.25 3.5 4.4 25.0 199.00 5 October 2010 745.50 553.00 49.0 3.25 2.3 1.6 25.0 318.00 3 October 2011 1200.00 988.00 42.9 3.25 2.8 1.3 25.0 446.00 Expected volatility is estimated by considering historic average share price volatility at the grant date.
The requirement that an employee has to save in order to purchase shares under the Sharesave Plan is a non-vesting condition.
This feature has been incorporated into the fair value at grant date by applying a discount to the valuation obtained from the Black Scholes pricing model.
The discount has been determined by estimating the probability that the employee will stop saving based on expected future trends in the share price and employee behaviour.

Performance will be measured over three financial years 1 January 2011 31 December 2013.
The vesting in March 2014 Vesting date of 25% of the 2011 PSP award will be dependent on a relative TSR performance condition measured over a three-year performance period and the vesting of 75% of the 2011 PSP award will be dependent on the satisfaction of an EPS growth target measured over a three-year performance period.
PSP award holders are entitled to receive dividends accruing between the Grant date and Vesting date and this value will be delivered in shares.
