47 we will meet long term environmental and regulatory trends with innovative new products Innovation is critical to our success both commercially and in innovation in Healthcare termsof underpinning our long term prosperity.
TM Novelia is the unique preservative free multidose eye drop In 2011 we introduced a Global Innovation Council to promote system designed by Rexam.
Compared with traditional unit innovation ideas relating to our products and processes across the dosesolutions, it also significantly reduces the amount of plastic Groups beverage cans operations.
This increased focusand firm required, reduces drug wastage by over 90% and also reduces process for sharing ideas will drive future product and process volume by nearly 90% due to its space efficient design.
In Plastic Packaging, we launched various new TM products, including the Panache spray mechanism, the R shaped TM lipstick case and the Advancia nasal spray.
90% We continue to research and evaluate the viability of non fossil resins.
key measure During 2011, on a statutory accounting basis, we invested 17m in R&D in continuing operations.
This includes design, construction and testing of preproduction protoypes, models and processes.
Our operations also invested in related new product and process initiatives which are not reported in this statutory figure.
In 2010 we supporting beverage customers invested 19m including 3m in discontinued operations.
Going inBrazil forward, we shall continue to ensure that our total investment in R&D remains appropriate to ensure our long term future.
We enhanced a customers range of 11 juice drinks by printing fruit images with high quality definition inks which dramatically increase consumer attractiveness of the brand.
operations: efficient use of resources We used tactile inks to help relaunch a major beer brand with aunique touch effect.
This can was recently highlighted in acase study by a packaging magazine in Brazil.
Rexam has a good record of increasing material efficiency and reducing energy consumption.
In 2011, we demonstrated our high standards of operational excellence by nominating several exemplar plants to be externally verified against the Shingo assessment, an internationally recognised evaluation of world classoperational excellence.
One plant was awarded the renowned Shingo Prize see page 23.
Underpinning this external canend technology which uses 10% less metal compared with verification, we have an established internal process measuring thestandard beverage can ends.

We also promote actively therecycling of plastic waste.
we will improve our material efficiency We believe that by continuing to share operational best practice, key measures and applying six sigma and other continuous improvement The key measures to monitor our improved material efficiency methods across the Group, we will be able to achieve Rexams arethe conversion efficiencies across the Group and the total vision of best performance both in terms of our financial results annual lightweighting savings for beverage cans.
In line with andour environmental record.
oneof our four core values, we target continuous improvement inmaterial efficiency.
This year we have continued to improve on our raw material efficiency by cutting the tonnes of raw material per tonne of 2011 2010 2009 production to 1.14 2010: 1.15.

Our North American beverage can business is spearheading anew intermodal freight system that prioritises trains over trucks.
For Beverage Cans, we measure the reduction in energy used per In 2011, nearly 1,500 truck loads were moved to rail, representing tonne of production.
In 2011, we achieved a 3% reduction versus a 1,700 tonnes saving of CO2.
Our target is to achieve a total reduction of 10% in the period between 2010 and 2013.
In Plastic Packaging, the amount of energy used pertonne of production increased by 2% in 2011 driven by lower overall 1,700 tonnes production volumes.
Our target isto achieve a total reduction of 8% in the period between 2010 and 2013.
With regard to our carbon efficiency, we are targeting a reduction in carbon intensity per kilogramme of raw material converted of we will improve our carbon efficiency and reduce the 10% between 2010 and 2013. energy and water we use We use resources every day, whether it is electricity, natural gas 2013 targets 2011 2010 2009 orwater to make our products or fuel to transport them to customers MWh of gas electricity sea, road, rail.

and then develop targets going forward.
In the UK, we are registered with two energy CO2 schemes: the Climate Change Agreement CCA to ensure our compliance with the Climate Change Levy: and the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme which will seek to capture energy usage from non CCA sites.
The majority of our energy usage in the UK is covered by the longstanding CCA at our UK manufacturing sites and we continue to comply with the requirements of this scheme.
Although we do not use a large amount of water in our operations, reducing waste in Austria we recognise the value of this increasingly scarce resource which is Our two beverage can plants in Austria have installeda new becoming more central to the sustainability strategies of many of filtration system that avoids the creation of filter cake, our our beverage customers.
In our beverage can plants, we reuse the largestwaste stream by weight, and which normally goes to water needed for washing the cans during the manufacturing landfill.
In2011 this innovative process avoided approximately process via closed loop recovery systems.
In our plastic packaging 500tonnes of filter cake waste and prevented the use of businesses, the water needed for the manufacturing process is 48tonnes ofwaste water chemicals.
In 2011 we provided water consumption and management data for the CDP Water survey.
