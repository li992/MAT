The potential impact to the Scheme for changes from RPI to CPI has been considered by the Trustees and the assumption for increases in deferred revaluation is now moving from RPI to CPI for the year end 31 January 2011.
In applying this adjustment, we have assumed that the long term CPI assumption is 0.5% lower than the corresponding RPI assumption.
The Mortality assumptions adopted at 31 January 2011 imply the following life expectancies from age 65.
