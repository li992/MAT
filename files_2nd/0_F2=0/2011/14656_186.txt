Financial statements Notes to the financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 20 August 2011 continued 22.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk With the exception of cash and short term deposits invested with banks and financial institutions, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
The Groups objective is to minimise credit risk by ensuring that surplus funds are invested with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings and that the Group deals with third parties that have been subject to credit checks or that have good credit scores, where appropriate.
Trade and other receivables, as shown on the consolidated balance sheet, comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers and are shown net of a provision for doubtful debts.
Management estimates the provision for doubtful debts based on a review of all individual receivable accounts, experience and known factors at the balance sheet date, taking into account any collateral held in the form of cash deposits, which is quantified.
These cash deposits are applied against unpaid debt when licensees leave the pubs, and vary in size.
The amount of cash deposits held at 20 August 2011 is 5.1m August 2010: 4.9m, August 2009: 5.5m.
These are held on the balance sheet within trade and other payables.
Receivables are written off against the doubtful debt provision when management deems the debt no longer recoverable.
