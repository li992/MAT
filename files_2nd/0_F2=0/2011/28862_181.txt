An additional 1% decrement was announced by the UK Government in the Budget on 23 March 2011.
The first decrement was enacted on 27 July 2010, the second on 29 March 2011 and the third on 5 July 2011.
Existing temporary differences may therefore unwind in periods subject to these reduced tax rates.
Accordingly, the closing deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated at the rate of 25%.
2 Prior year tax adjustments include releases of tax provisions in respect of structured transactions and investment disposals, and adjustments to reflect submitted tax computations in the UK and overseas.
