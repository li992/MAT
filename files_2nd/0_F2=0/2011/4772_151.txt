The differences are explained below: 52 week period 53 week period ended ended 30 December 31 December 2011 2010 m m Profit before taxation 40.3 39.8 Profit before taxation multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 26.5% 2010: 28% 10.7 11.1 Effects of: Adjustments in respect of prior period 0.1 Exceptional adjustment in respect of closing deferred tax rate change 27% to 25% 2010: 28% to 27% 1.8 0.7 Exceptional adjustment for recognition of brought forward losses 3.4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.5 0.5 Total taxation 6.0 10.8 Under IFRS the tax rate is lower 2010: lower than the standard UK tax rate of 26.5 per cent 2010: 28 per cent principally due to the exceptional adjustments in both periods.
Without these exceptional adjustments the rate would be higher 2010: higher due to a combination of the impact of disallowable trading expenses and expenditure on the Groups premises that does not attract any deductions for tax purposes.
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 28 per cent to 26 per cent with effect from 1 April 2011.
Accordingly the Groups profits for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 27.5 per cent.
As a result, the Group recognised exceptional tax income of 1.8 million 2010: 0.7 million through its income statement to reflect the one off reduction in the period of the Groups deferred tax position.
In addition to the changes in rates of corporation tax disclosed above a number of further changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 2012 was substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and so the deferred tax balance has been calculated at 25 per cent.
Further rate changes are anticipated, if these are subsequently enacted in the form expected then the corporation tax rate will reduce by a further 1 per cent per annum until 2014 when it will be 23 per cent.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not recognised in these financial statements.
Each percentage point reduction in corporation tax rate is expected to reduce the deferred tax liability by approximately 1 million.
These impacts will be recognised in the period in which substantive enactment occurs.
