Deferred income tax Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The offset amounts are as follows: Group 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax assets: deferred tax assets to be recovered after more than 12 months 115.3 147.2 deferred tax assets to be recovered within 12 months 13.4 4.2 128.7 151.4 Deferred tax liabilities: deferred tax liabilities to be recovered after more than 12 months 18.4 1.7 deferred tax liabilities to be recovered within 12 months 17.2 0.3 35.6 2.0 Deferred tax assets net 93.1 149.4 a Net deferred tax assets liabilities Group 2011 2010 m m Accelerated depreciation 12.2 18.0 Share-based payments 3.3 3.1 Deferred tax asset on post-employment benefit liabilities 88.5 123.0 Deferred income 10.0 1.9 Amortisation of intangibles on acquisitions 16.3 Other temporary differences 15.4 3.4 Total deferred income tax 93.1 149.4 b Analysis of movements during the year Group 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax assets at 1 April 149.4 101.6 Transfers between current and deferred tax 0.5 Deferred tax charged credited to the income statement continuing operations note 8 9.9 0.5 Deferred tax on acquisitions 18.7 Deferred tax charged credited to equity note 8 27.8 46.6 Foreign exchange difference on deferred tax 0.1 0.2 Deferred tax assets at 31 March 93.1 149.4 A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 budget statement.
2 Act 2010, which was substantively enacted on 20 July 2010, includes legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011.
Following the March 2011 budget statement, the main rate of corporation tax was further reduced from 27% to 26% from 1 April 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
However, these later reductions have not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and therefore are not included in these Financial Statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 26% to 23%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 March 2011, would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately 12.3m being 4.1m recognised in 2012, 4.1m recognised in 2013 and 4.1m recognised in 2014.
