39 Contingent liabilities The properties in certain subsidiary companies forming a guarantee group provide the security for the groups core debt facility.
Barclays Bank Plc and Lloyds TSB Bank Plc have provided guarantees under performance bonds relating to the groups UK development division.
As at 30 September 2011 total guarantees amounted to 2.1m 2010: 2.4m.
In addition, the group has an obligation, under the sale and purchase agreement for the land at West Waterlooville, to pay further consideration should the site value exceed certain pre-agreed amounts.
It is not possible to determine the amount or timing of any such future payments due to the long-term nature of the sites development and the associated uncertainties.
However, it is unlikely that any future payments will fall due until at least 2015 and any payments made will be spread over a number of years.
As explained in more detail in note 20, there is uncertainty relating to the future of the site of Curzon Park in which the group has a 50% joint venture interest.
Should the value of the site, together with any compensation received, be insufficient to repay the bank loan in the joint venture entity, the group may incur charges in excess of those provided in these financial statements, in respect of obligations to the joint venture and the bank.
40 Rights issue In December 2009 the company completed a two for one rights issue at an issue price of 90p per share raising a total gross amount of 249.8m, net of costs 236.7m.
The rights issue increased the number of share in issue by 277,553,406 shares, increasing share capital by 13.9m.
The group took advantage of section 612 of the Companies Act 2006 to take proceeds in excess of the nominal value of shares issued, amounting to 235.9m, to a merger reserve.
Under a cash-box mechanism this amount has been subsequently transferred to retained earnings.
Costs of issue which totalled 13.1m have been taken directly to reserves.
