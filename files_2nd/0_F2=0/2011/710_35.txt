Review of operations Simberi Project Oxide operations Key operating statistics for the mining and processing activities for the 2010 and 2011 reporting periods are summarised in the table below: Volume Volume Key operating statistic Unit of measure 2011 2010 Waste mined tonnes 1,884,616 1,491,093 Ore mined tonnes 2,111,733 2,241,526 Total mined tonnes 3,996,349 3,732,619 Ore processed tonnes 1,881,706 2,137,139 Grade g t gold 1.08 1.16 Recovery % 87.6 88.9 Gold produced ounces 57,284 69,974 Gold sold ounces 55,216 64,147 Average realised gold price US$ oz 1,571 1,218 Net cash cost US$ oz 1,021 666 Production at Simberi was 57,284 ounces, which was down from 69,974 in the prior year, affected by the following factors: o 34 days of lost production approximately 6,622 ounces of production in March and April due to repairs to the Simberi tailing disposal tank and system.
o 25 days of lost production approximately 4,833 ounces in October due to repairs to the Ball Mill.
o Unusually wet weather in August and September impeding access to higher grade pits and restricting the ability to blend ore.
The cash costs for mining, processing and administration reflect the predominantly fixed cost base being allocated over lower than expected production volumes.
Initiatives to debottleneck the Simberi plant were successfully delivered during the year to increase mill throughput.
Oxide Expansion The Group is currently undertaking incremental expansion of the plant to lift processing capacity to 3.5 million tonnes per annum mtpa, which should increase gold production to approximately 100,000 ounces per annum.
Completion of the expansion is forecast to be in the second half of 2012.
As at December 31, 2011 the Group has spent $15.5 million on design, engineering, civil works and ordering of long lead items.
The Company expects to spend a further $26 million in 2012.
The Simberi expansion also includes installation of a cyanide destruction unit associated with the tailings disposal system, which has been added to the scope of works.
A semi autogenous grinding SAG mill and thickener are on site at Simberi.
The Group has the fleet of haulage trucks on site to support the expansion.
The major long lead item awaiting delivery is the ore reclaimer which is expected to be delivered to site in the June 2012 quarter.

Heavy Fuel Oil Diesel costs at Simberi are approximately $1.15 per litre, with power generating costs for processing approximately $118 oz.
As part of lowering operating costs and installing a lower cost energy source for the long term, Simberi will transition from diesel fuel generation to heavy fuel oil HFO during mid 2012 to take advantage of the 30% price differential between the landed cost of diesel and HFO.
This is expected to reduce the cost of power generation by $30-$50 oz based on current market prices.
Installing HFO is estimated to cost approximately $20 million, including the purchase of generator sets, storage tanks and associated infrastructure.
Of the $20 million, approximately $1.9 million had been expended at the end of the December quarter with the remaining $18 million forecast to be expended in 2012.
Simberi Sulphide Bankable Feasibility Study BFS Resource drilling and study work continued during the period with a new resource estimate expected in June 2012 prior to the finalization of a Bankable Feasibility Study BFS due in the September quarter 2012.
The Company already has one million ounces of sulphides reserves at Simberi.
One of the key objectives of the BFS is to ensure the technical parameters of the probable roaster technology are fully understood and that the associated capital cost is confirmed.
It is anticipated that the BFS will conclude with a scope for a 2.5 mtpa roaster producing 130,000-150,000 ounces per annum over a 7- 10 year period.
The possible sulphide development would occur mid-decade once sufficient volumes of the oxide cap at Simberi have been processed.
Exploration At Simberi, exploration comprised both metallurgical and exploration core drilling for the Simberi Sulphide BFS, due to be presented in 2012.
A total of 4,313 metres were drilled in 20 core holes, which, while intending to provide metallurgical samples for the BFS, were also designed to increase the drill density within the Pigiput resource model area.
The assay results are in-line with expectations and allow the resources classification to be reviewed when re-estimated in the first half of 2012.
Elsewhere, exploration drilling located mineralisation warranting further investigation.
Current exploration activity also includes core drilling of at-depth IP chargeability responses between the Pigibo and Pigiput deposits and mapping and surface sampling of areas around the Sorowar deposit.
EL609 held by the Group in Papua New Guinea expired on 5 May 2011 and is currently the subject of an application for renewal for an additional two year term which has not yet been processed, failing which the Groups rights to EL609 may be forfeited.
The Group believes it has complied with all technical and administrative requirements in relation to the renewal.
It is not unusual for the renewal process for such licences to occur over an extended period of time.
Page | 24 Allied Gold Mining PLC Directors report December 31, 2011 Gold Ridge Project Key operating statistics for the mining and processing activities for the 2010 and 2011 reporting periods are summarised in the table below: Volume Volume Key operating statistic Unit of measure 1 2011 2010 Waste mined tonnes 3,295,901 470,140 Ore mined tonnes 1,480,275 80,628 Total mined tonnes 4,776,176 550,768 Ore processed tonnes 1,377,870 - Grade g t gold 1.66 - Recovery % 68.7 - Gold produced ounces 51,054 - Gold sold ounces 39,060 - Average realised gold price US$ oz 1,689 - Net cash cost US$ oz 1,274 - 1 The Gold Ridge Project was acquired by the Group in November 2009.
In March 2010 the Group commenced a $150 million redevelopment project which resulted in the first gold being poured in March 2011 and as such there were no processing volumes or gold produced in 2010.
Official re-opening ceremony was held with Government and community leaders on March 23, 2011.
First gold was poured in March 2011.
This was achieved within a year of the commencement of the redevelopment of the project and following the investment of $150 million into the redevelopment and refurbishment of the mine.
Commissioning activities continued through to June 2011 as ramp up to full scale production was undertaken.
During commissioning of the plant, all production costs have been capitalised, net of any revenue that was generated from gold sales.
Gold Ridge produced 51,054 ounces for the year.
Production was affected by reliance on lower grade remnant ore material from the Valehaichichi pit pending completion of construction of access roads into the Dawsons and Kupers pits.
Construction of these haul roads was accelerated and completed in the March 2012 quarter as accessing these pits will provide more flexibility and optimise ore blending strategies.
A review in December of the crushing, conveying and processing circuits by the Groups newly appointed GM Operations has identified several opportunities for enhancements to lift plant throughput.
Enhanced supervision of the hopper area and more direct tipping by trucks into the hopper, have lifted the feed rate at the end of the period.
The Company continues to refine blending and assess other initiatives to optimise the processing circuit.
The cash cost reflects the allocation of Gold Ridges largely fixed costs over production volumes that were below the expected annual run rate of 105,000 ounces.
In addition, cash costs include write-offs of approximately $2.5 million relating to materials carried forward from the construction phase that are no longer required by operations.
