Warning to shareholders Boiler Room Scams A number of companies, including Pennon Group Plc, continue to be aware that their shareholders have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence concerning investment matters which imply a connection to the company concerned.
These are typically from overseas based brokers who target UK shareholders offering to buy their shares or to sell them what can turn out to be worthless or high risk shares in US or UK investments.
They can be very persistent and extremely persuasive and a 2006 survey by the Financial Services Authority FSA has reported that the average amount lost by investors is around 20,000.
It is not just the novice investor who has been duped in this way: many of the victims had been successfully investing for several years.
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free reports into the Company.
If you are contacted in this manner, please make sure you obtain the correct name of the person and organisation and where they are based.
You should also check that they are properly authorised by the FSA before getting involved and should call the organisation back using their details in the FSA register to verify their authorisation you can check online fsa.
do If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you would not be eligible to receive any payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.
