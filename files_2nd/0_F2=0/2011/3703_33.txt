NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.

This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
If authorised, it will be paid on 1 June 2012 to shareholders who are on the register of members as at 4 May 2012.
The total dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2011 will therefore be 8.0 pence per share 2010: 6.0 pence.
The total amount payable in respect of 2011 will be 86.4m.
Directors emoluments and pension costs Disclosures in respect of Directors emoluments can be found in the Directors remuneration report on pages 44 to 53 of the Group financial statements.
Defined benefit pension schemes The Company operates and participates in the Cobham Pension Plan CPP and the Cobham Executive Pension Plan CEPP.
The pension schemes are of thedefined benefit type and assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The funds are valued every three years by a professionally qualified independent actuary and the rates of contribution payable are determined by the actuary.
The latest effective dates of the actuarial assessment of the CPPand CEPP were 1 April 2009 and 1 April 2010 respectively.
The assessments were updated to 31 December 2011 at which date the total net liabilities of theschemes were assessed to be 29.0m.
The Directors of the companies involved in the Group schemes will continue to monitor the pension deficits and take advice from independent actuaries as appropriate.
As part of the Groups risk management strategy for defined benefit obligations, certain liabilities relating to past service of pensioner and deferred members of the CEPP were subject to a buy-in arrangement on 14 December 2011.
Under the terms of this arrangement, assets were transferred to an insurance company in return for a qualifying insurance policy which provides annuity payments equal to the liabilities covered by the arrangement as they fall due.
This eliminates exposure to the interest, inflation and longevity risks associated with these liabilities and is a meaningful, but not yet significant, first step of a project to review the exposure to risks associated with pension obligations.
The schemes have been accounted for as if they were defined contribution schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account therefore reflects payments for the year.
Contributions to the Group schemes for 2011 amounted to 0.3m 2010: 0.3m of normal funding and an additional contribution of 17.5m related to the buy-in arrangement 2010: 7.9m connected to a prior year business divestment.
Nocontributions were outstanding at the end of 2011 or 2010.

The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds.
