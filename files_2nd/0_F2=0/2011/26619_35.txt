Man Group plc 75 Annual Report 2011 21.
Capital management Investor confidence is an important element in the sustainability of our franchise.
That confidence comes, in part, from the strength of our capital base.
Man has maintained significant excess capital and available liquidity throughout the recent periods of financial crisis.
This capital has given Man flexibility to support our investors, intermediaries and financial partners and to allow them to make informed decisions regarding their investment exposures.
This confidence gives our franchise credibility and sustainability.
We have a conservative capital and liquidity framework which allows us to invest in the growth of the business.
We utilise capital to support the operation of the investment management process and the launch of new fund products.
We view this as a competitive advantage and allows us to align directly our interests with those of investors and intermediaries.
Man monitors its capital requirements through continuous review of its regulatory capital and economic capital, including monthly reporting to Finance Committee and the Board.
The Board approach to the use or distribution of available capital surpluses is discussed in the Chairmans Review.
Regulatory capital unaudited For regulatory capital purposes Man is subject to consolidated financial supervision by the UK Financial Services Authority FSA in the same manner as our bank intermediaries and counterparties.
Our regulatory capital requirements are in accordance with FSA rules consistent with the Capital Requirements Directive.
We use the Standardised Approach to calculate Pillar 1 requirements for both credit risk and operational risk.
Our assessment of internal capital adequacy for Pillar 2 purposes is based on our economic capital model which uses a combination of stochastic and scenario modelling.
Our financial resources have exceeded our financial resource requirements regulatory capital requirements at all times during the year.
The majority of our regulatory capital requirements relate to acquisition franchise value and other intangibles which, as we are subject to consolidated supervision, must be deducted in full from our Tier 1 capital.
The remaining financial resource requirements, mainly in relation to operational risk see page 49 for more details and risks arising on investments in fund products Note 14 are supported by available Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital.
The table below summarises the regulatory capital requirements.
The reduction in excess capital from the previous year results primarily from the use of capital relating to the franchise value arising on the acquisition of GLG as discussed in Note 13.1.
