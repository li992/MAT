Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in notes 27 and 28.
The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit from ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, which from 1 April 2011 was 26% 2010: 28%, with the exception of upstream profits, which were taxed at a UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2010: 30% plus a supplementary charge.
From 29 March 2011, the supplementary charge was increased to 32% 2010: 20%.
Also announced in March 2011, was an intention to restrict from 2012, the rate of tax relief on decommissioning costs from the current 62% to 50%.
If enacted, a one-off charge of approximately 60 million will arise from revaluing the related deferred tax provisions.
Certain upstream assets also bear petroleum revenue tax at 50% 2010: 50%.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.
82 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 9.
TAXATION CONTINUED The UK Government has announced its intention to propose Parliament reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 1 April 2014.
At 31 December 2011 a reduction in the rate to 25% had been substantively enacted so the relevant UK deferred tax assets and liabilities included in these Financial Statements have been based on that rate.
The effect of the additional proposed reduction in the UK corporation tax rate by 2014 would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by 11 million.
b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The differences between the total tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax are as follows: 2011 2010 Exceptional items Exceptional items Business and certain Results for Business and certain Results for performance re-measurements the year performance re-measurements the year m m m m m m Profit from continuing operations before tax 2,062 794 1,268 1,929 880 2,809 Less: share of profits in joint ventures and associates, net of interest and taxation 93 26 67 7 14 7 Group profit from continuing operations before tax 1,969 768 1,201 1,922 894 2,816 Tax on profit from continuing operations at standard UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% 2010: 28% 522 204 318 538 250 788 Effects of: Net expenses not deductible for tax purposes 20 20 42 15 27 Movement in unrecognised deferred tax assets 28 31 59 8 1 7 UK petroleum revenue tax rates 128 128 152 152 Overseas tax rates 24 9 2 4 6 15 Additional charges applicable to upstream profits 152 2 154 73 27 46 Changes to tax rates 30 201 171 15 1 14 Adjustments in respect of prior years 34 1 33 92 9 83 Taxation on profit from continuing operations 810 16 826 708 221 929 c Factors that may affect future tax charges Production of gas and oil within the UK continental shelf is subject to several taxes: corporation tax at 30% 2010: 30% on profits of gas and oil production, a supplementary charge at 32% 2010: 20% on profits of gas and oil production adjusted for financing costs and petroleum revenue tax PRT at 50% 2010: 50% on income generated from certain gas and oil production net of certain costs.
PRT is a deductible expense for the purposes of corporation tax and the supplementary charge.
The effective rate of tax suffered on profits of UK gas production therefore falls between 62% and 81% 2010: 50% and 75%.
To the extent that the Groups profits are earned from UK gas and oil production, its effective tax rate will remain above the current UK statutory rate of 26% 2010: 28%.
Income earned in territories outside the UK, notably in the USA and Norway, is generally subject to higher effective rates of tax than the current UK statutory rate.
In the medium term, particularly given additional investments being made in Norway, the Groups effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate.

EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for the year of 421 million 2010: 1,935 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 5,159 million 2010: 5,146 million.
The number of shares excludes seven million ordinary shares 2010: six million, being the weighted average number of the Companys own shares held in the employee share trust which are treated as treasury shares.
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for certain re-measurements, exceptional items and the impact of Strategic Investments, assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group, as explained in note 2.

Additionally, the impact of depreciation arising on fair value uplifts attributed to the British Energy nuclear power stations and related taxation included within the Groups share of the post-taxation results of the associate is excluded in arriving at adjusted earnings for the period, which amounted to 41 million 2010: 58 million net of taxation.

SOURCES OF FINANCE The Group funds its business using a combination of debt and shareholders equity.
2011 2010 31 December m m Net debt 3,435 3,312 Shareholders equity 5,600 5,819 Capital 9,035 9,131 The Group seeks to maintain an efficient capital structure with a balance of debt and equity.
Debt levels are restricted to limit the risk of financial distress and, in particular, to maintain strong credit ratings.
The Groups credit ratings are important for several reasons, to: maintain a low cost of debt: limit collateral requirements in energy trading, hedging and decommissioning security arrangements: and ensure the Group is an attractive counterparty to energy producers and long term customers.
At 31 December 2011, the Groups long-term credit rating was A3 stable outlook for Moodys Investor Services Limited and A stable outlook for Standard & Poors Credit Market Services Europe Limited.
These ratings did not change during 2011.
The Group monitors its current and projected capital position on a regular basis, considering a medium-term view of three to five years, and different stress case scenarios, including the impact of changes in the Groups credit ratings and significant movements in commodity prices.
A number of financial ratios are monitored, including those used by the credit rating agencies, such as debt to cash flow ratios and EBITDA to gross interest expense.
At 31 December 2011, the ratio of the Groups net debt to EBITDA was 1.1 2010: 1.0.
EBITDA to gross interest expense for the year ended 31 December 2011 was 8.7 2010: 6.7.
British Gas Insurance Limited BGIL is required under FSA regulations to hold a minimum capital amount and has complied with this requirement in 2011 and 2010.
For the remainder of the Group, the level of debt that can be raised is restricted by the Companys Articles of Association.
Net debt is limited to the greater of 5.0 billion and a gearing ratio of three times adjusted capital and reserves.
Based on adjusted capital and reserves as at 31 December 2011 of 5.6 billion, the limit for net debt was 16.8 billion.
The Group funds its debt principally through issuing bonds.
In addition the Group also maintains substantial committed facilities from banks see note 25, but generally uses these to provide backup liquidity and does not typically draw on them.

Fluctuations in profits from year to year may therefore give rise to divergence between the charge for the current year and taxes paid: and Petroleum revenue tax payments are based on income realised in the preceding period, with subsequent adjustments to reflect actual profits.
Variations in production from period to period may therefore lead to temporary differences between tax charged and tax paid.

ii Carrying amount of goodwill also contains goodwill from other Direct Energy acquisitions which are not significant compared with the aggregate carrying value of goodwill reported within the CGU.
iii Goodwill balances allocated across multiple CGUs.
The amount of goodwill allocated to each CGU is not significant compared with the aggregate carrying value of goodwill reported within the Group.
This balance also includes 33 million for gas storage.
c Key assumptions used Value in use calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for all of the goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset balances, with the exception of the impairment test for the Upstream UK Upstream gas and oil CGU, where fair value less costs to sell has been used as the basis for determining recoverable amount.
Value in use VIU The VIU calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on the Groups Board-approved three-year business plans.
The Groups business plans are based on past experience, and adjusted to reflect market trends, economic conditions, key risks, the implementation of strategic objectives and changes in commodity prices, as appropriate.
Commodity prices used in the planning process are based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates.
The extent to which the commodity prices used in the business plans are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
Note 24 provides additional detail on the active period of each of the commodity markets in which the Group operates.
i Growth rates and discount rates Cash flows beyond the three-year plan period have been extrapolated using long-term growth rates in the market where the CGU operates.
Long-term growth rates are determined using a blend of publicly available historical data and long-term growth rate forecasts published by external analysts.
Cash flows are discounted using a discount rate specific to each CGU.
Discount rates reflect the current market assessments of the time value of money and are based on the estimated cost of capital of each CGU.
Additionally, risks specific to the cash flows of the CGUs are reflected within cash flow forecasts.
Each CGUs weighted average cost of capital is then adjusted to reflect the impact of tax in order to calculate an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
Long-term growth rates and pre-tax discount rates used in the VIU calculations for each of the Groups CGUs are provided in the table below: Downstream UK North America North America North America Business energy Downstream UK Residential Business Residential and supply and services Residential services energy supply energy supply business services Growth rate to perpetuity 2.0% 2.0% 2.1% 2.1% 2.1% Pre-tax discount rate 7.5% 7.5% 8.5% 8.5% 8.5% ii Inflation rates Inflation rates used in the three-year business plan were based on a blend of a number of publicly available inflation forecasts for the UK, Canada and the US.
Inflation rates used for the value in use calculations were as follows: UK: 2.0%, Canada: 2.1% and the US: 2.6%.

Fair value less costs to sell FVLCS FVLCS is used as the basis for determining the recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to Upstream UK gas and oil.
This methodology is deemed to be more appropriate as it is based on the post-tax cash flows arising from Upstream UK gas and oil as a whole.
This is consistent with the approach taken by management to evaluate the economic value of the underlying assets.
Discount rate and cash-flow assumptions, Upstream UK Upstream gas and oil FVLCS is determined by discounting the post-tax cash flows expected to be generated by the gas production and development assets, net of associated selling costs, taking into account those assumptions that market participants would use in estimating fair value.
Post-tax cash flows are derived from projected production profiles of each field, taking into account forward prices for gas and liquids over the relevant period.
Where forward market prices are not available, prices are determined based on internal model inputs.
The date of cessation of production depends on the interaction of a number of variables, such as the recoverable quantities of hydrocarbons, production costs, the contractual duration of the licence area and the selling price of the gas and liquids produced.
As each field has specific reservoir characteristics and economic circumstances, the post-tax cash flows for each field are computed using individual economic models.
Post-tax cash flows used in the FVLCS calculation for the first three years are based on the Groups Boardapproved three-year business plans and, thereafter, are based on long-term production and cash flow forecasts.
The future post-tax cash flows are discounted using a post-tax nominal discount rate of 8.5% to determine the FVLCS.
The discount rate and inflation rate used in the FVLCS calculation are determined in the same manner as the rates used in the VIU calculations described above, with the exception of the adjustment required to determine an equivalent pre-tax discount rate.
d Summary of results For all of the above CGUs the recoverable amounts exceeded their carrying values at the impairment test date.
Reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions listed above would not cause the recoverable amounts of the goodwill balances to be equal to or less than the carrying amounts.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES CONTINUED At 31 December 2011, there were 24 million 2010: 25 million of receivables, net of provisions for credit losses, from residential customers and 22 million 2010: 22 million from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties that were individually impaired.
Receivables from residential customers are generally reviewed for impairment on an individual basis once a customer discontinues their relationship with the Group.
The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of expected default and loss factors, determined by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable from residential and business customers on a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts.
Balances are written off when recoverability is assessed as being remote.

These relate primarily to residential customers in the UK.
During the year the Group took possession of 32 million of customer deposits when customers defaulted on their accounts receivable balance.
At 31 December 2011 the Group held 50 million 2010: 56 million of customer deposits for the purposes of mitigating the credit risk associated with receivables from residential and business customers.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments are held for the following purposes and accounted for accordingly: Purpose Accounting treatment Proprietary energy trading Carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the Groups results for the year before exceptional items and certain i and treasury management re-measurements ii Energy procurement Carried at fair value, with changes in the fair value reflected in certain re-measurements i With the exception of certain energy derivatives related to cross-border transportation and capacity contracts note S2 ii Energy contracts designated at fair value through profit and loss include certain energy contracts that the Group has, at its option, designated at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39 because the energy contract contains one or more embedded derivatives that significantly modify the cash flows under the contract note S2.
In cases where a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, derivatives are classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation.
Notes 20 and S2 provide further detail on the Groups hedge accounting.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
Note S2 details the Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The fair values of derivative and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at 31 December were as follows: 2011 2010 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Fair value hedges 153 105 Cash flow hedges 79 91 7 43 Fair value hedges The Groups fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements used to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate, long-term debt due to movements in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being hedged are recognised as income within net interest expense.
Gains or losses arising on fair value hedges at 31 December were as follows: 2010 2011 Gains losses m m On hedging instruments 49 41 On hedged items attributable to the hedged risk 60 41 11 Cash flow hedges The Groups cash flow hedges consist primarily of: physical and financial gas and power purchase contracts used to protect against the variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable forecast purchases of gas and power due to movements in market commodity prices: forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions: and interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements used to protect against the variability in cash flows associated with floating-rate borrowings due to movements in market interest rates.
Gains and losses are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in other comprehensive income and are transferred to the Income Statement when the forecast cash flows affect the Income Statement.
Note 27 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve.
The ineffective portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging are recognised immediately in the Income Statement.
During 2011, the Group recognised a 3 million gain 2010: 2 million loss due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness.

HEDGE ACCOUNTING CONTINUED Net investment hedges Historically the Group engaged in net investment hedging NIH whereby it would obtain foreign currency debt issued in the same currency as the net investment.
In 2009 the Group ceased NIH however the opening balance of the foreign currency translation reserve includes exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as NIH under the requirements of IAS 39.
These balances will be recycled to the Group Income Statement on disposal of the foreign operation.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
A significant proportion of these assets may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, no temporary differences existed in respect of the Groups overseas investments 2010: 87 million.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties under no compulsion to act.
The Group has documented internal policies for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.
2011 2010 Carrying value Fair value Carrying value Fair value Financial liabilities Notes m m m m Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: Trade and other payables 3,609 3,609 3,578 3,578 21 Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings: Bank overdrafts and loans 12 267 274 277 241 12 Bonds 3,460 3,891 3,407 3,693 12 Commercial paper 114 114 12 Obligations under finance leases 330 328 352 364 Provisions 23 384 384 130 130 8,164 8,600 7,744 8,006 Financial liabilities at fair value: Derivative financial instruments 19 1,645 1,645 1,403 1,403 Financial assets The carrying values of the Groups financial assets disclosed in notes 12, 18 and 19 are equal to the fair values of those assets.
Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings The fair values of bonds are based on quoted market prices.
The fair values of bank loans have been determined by discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest.
The fair values of overdrafts and commercial paper are assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts.
The fair values of obligations under finance leases have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Groups cost of borrowing.
Other financial instruments Due to their nature and or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.
Derivative financial instruments and energy contracts designated at fair value through profit and loss The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are determined by reference to closing market rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of energy derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based in part on observable market data and in part on internal estimates not currently supported by observable market data.
The extent to which fair values of energy derivatives are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is judged to be active.
The Group has judged each of the markets in which it operates as active for the purposes of accounting as follows: Active period of markets Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil UK years 22 3 2 3 North America years 5 Up to 5 n a Up to 5 n a The fair values of energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 that settle inside the active period of the market are based on quoted market prices and expected volumes, discounted at an average rate of 1% per annum 2010: 1%.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments in North America and Europe are based primarily on quoted market prices.
In the UK, however, certain energy contracts extend beyond the active period of the market.
The fair values of energy contracts that extend beyond the active period of the market are determined by reference in part to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using valuation techniques based on commodity prices derived using assumptions that are based on internal market expectations and expected volumes, discounted using an average discount rate of 2% per annum for 2011.
Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price, a day-one gain or loss will arise.
Such gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual period until such time as observable market data becomes available see note S2 for further detail.
The amount that has yet to be recognised in the Income Statement relating to the difference between the fair value at initial recognition the transaction price and the amount that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition, less subsequent releases, is as follows: 2011 2010 Net deferred gains losses m m 109 86 1 January Net losses gains deferred on new transactions 7 2 Recognised in the Income Statement during the year 43 21 31 December 59 109 Directors Report Business Review Directors Report Governance Financial Statements Appendix to the Directors Report Shareholder Information Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 97 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.

The impacts of reasonably possible changes to assumed gas, power, coal, emissions and oil prices on the net fair value of the Groups fair value measurements categorised as Level 3 are as follows: 2011 2010 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible change change Energy price in variable in variable UK gas p therm 9 11 UK power MWh 6 5 UK coal US$ tonne 13 21 UK emissions tonne 2 2 UK oil US$ bbl 20 18 2011 2010 Increase decrease in fair value m m UK energy prices increase decrease 52 38 9 12 98 Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Financial Statements NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 24.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED The impacts disclosed above result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing energy contracts in relation to gas, power, emissions, coal and oil prices to reasonably possible alternative assumptions at the balance sheet date.
The fair value impacts only concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and are marked-to-market based on valuation models using assumptions that are not currently observable in an active market.
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution, as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Groups actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Groups portfolio of energy contracts changes.
Changes in fair values based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated as the relationship between the change in market variable and the change in fair value will not always be linear.
This can be seen in the results from the above 2010 sensitivity analysis.
Due to the interaction of various contract price floors and ceilings and optionality in purchase sales volumes, both scenarios lead to an increase in the total fair value of the Level 3 assets and liabilities.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Groups normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The processes for managing these risks are set out in note S3.
The information in this note sets out financial metrics related to these risks.
Transactional and translational currency risks It is the Groups policy to hedge material transactional exposures using forward contracts to fix the functional currency value of nonfunctional currency cash flows, except where there is an economic hedge inherent in the transaction.
At 31 December 2011, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions 2010: nil, other than transactions which have an inherent economic hedge and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge translational exposures.
The Group manages translational currency risk taking into consideration the cash impact of any hedging activity as well as the risk to the net asset numbers in the Groups Financial Statements.
The translation hedging programme including the potential cash impact is monitored by the GFRMC.
The impacts of reasonably possible changes in foreign currency rates relative to pounds sterling on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set out in note S3 are as follows: 2011 2010 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible Foreign exchange rates and incremental change Impact on Impact on change Impact on Impact on in variable profit equity in variable profit equity profit loss % m m % m m US dollar 10 14 23 17 20 10 75 94 20 18 Canadian dollar 10 18 20 54 66 10 20 20 52 43 Euro 10 33 20 19 23 10 28 33 5 7 Interest rate risk The impacts of reasonably possible changes in interest rates on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set out in note S3 are as follows: 2011 2010 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible change Impact on Impact on change Impact on Impact on in variable profit equity in variable profit equity Interest rates and incremental profit loss % m m % m m UK interest rates 1.0 6 4 27 33 1.0 14 12 14 18 US interest rates 1.0 2 4 1.0 2 6 Euro interest rates 1.0 4 5 1.0 7 5 Commodity price risk The impacts of reasonably possible changes in commodity prices on profit and equity, both after taxation, based on the assumptions set out in note S3 are as follows: 2011 2010 Reasonably Reasonably possible possible change change Energy prices Base price i in variable Base price i in variable UK gas p therm 59 9 59 11 UK power MWh 47 6 51 5 UK coal US$ tonne 117 13 121 21 UK emissions tonne 8 2 14 2 UK oil US$ bbl 101 20 95 18 North American gas USc therm 6 42 52 9 North American power US$ MWh 43 4 48 4 i The base price represents the average forward market price over the duration of the active market curve used in the sensitivity analysis provided.

Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios, including, but not limited to, reasonably possible increases or decreases in commodity prices and the potential cash implications of a credit rating downgrade.
The Group seeks to ensure that sufficient financial headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern.
It is the Group's policy to maintain committed facilities and or available surplus cash resources of at least 1,200 million, raise at least 75% of its net debt excluding non-recourse debt in the long-term debt market and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse long-term debt portfolio greater than five years.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had undrawn committed credit facilities of 3,254 million 2010: 2,873 million and 518 million 2010: 467 million of cash and cash equivalents.
These facilities include a 500 million facility to aid the purchase of the Statoil gas and oil assets described in note 37.
115% 2010: 121% of the Groups net debt has been raised in the long-term debt market and the average term to maturity of the long-term debt portfolio was 9.6 years 2010: 10.5 years.
The Groups liquidity is impacted by the cash pledged under margin collateral agreements: the table below summarises the movements in margin cash: 2011 2010 m m Cash pledged as collateral at 1 January 173 631 Net cash outflow inflow 26 466 Transferred from discontinued operations 2 Acquisition of businesses 17 Foreign exchange 1 8 i Cash pledged as collateral at 31 December 219 173 i Within discontinued operations there was also a net 8 million cash inflow of collateral in the period 2010: 25 million outflow.
The net cash collateral pledged of 219 million is included in trade payables, 4 million, and trade receivables, 223 million 2010: 173 million.
The relatively high level of undrawn committed bank borrowing facilities and available cash resources has enabled the Directors to conclude that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
The statement of going concern is included in the Directors' Report Governance, on page 51.

2011 was marked by a continuing shortage of available credit in European energy markets due to general economic conditions and the continuing impact of the European Sovereign debt concerns.
The Group does not hold any financial instruments issued by any of Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain governments.
Further consolidation of energy market participants in key European markets has also impacted overall market activity.
Credit markets in North America have followed suit and have been volatile due to ongoing US economy and European Sovereign debt concerns.
The Group continues to be vigilant and manage credit risk in accordance with its risk management policy.
Details of how credit risk is managed across the asset categories shown below are included in note S3.
Credit risk from financial assets is measured by counterparty credit rating as follows: 2011 2010 Receivables from Receivables from Derivative financial treasury, trading and Derivative financial treasury, trading and instruments with energy procurement Cash and cash instruments with energy procurement Cash and cash positive fair values counterparties equivalents positive fair values counterparties equivalents m m m m m m AAA to AA 5 128 411 26 12 363 AA to A 469 408 106 647 334 104 BBB to BBB 23 137 42 175 BB to BB 20 27 1 2 14 B or lower 3 1 i Unrated 85 237 73 311 605 938 518 790 846 467 i The unrated counterparty receivables primarily comprise amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing houses.

PENSIONS CONTINUED Included within the Group Balance Sheet within non-current securities are 54 million 2010: 52 million of investments, held by the Law Debenture Trust on behalf of the Company, as security in respect of the unfunded Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme.
Included within the pension schemes liabilities above are 34 million 2010: 33 million relating to this scheme.
h Pension scheme contributions Based on the triennial valuation at 31 March 2009, the Company and the trustees of the Registered Pension Schemes agreed a schedule for deficit payments.
An amount of 27 million has been paid in the year to 31 December 2011 and the following further deficit payments will be made: 37 million in 2012 and 57 million per annum from 2013 to 2016.
Although there is an accounting surplus in the three Registered Pension Schemes, low government bond yields are likely to result in a deficit at the next triennial valuation scheduled to be prepared for the trustees as at 31 March 2012.
It is unlikely, therefore, that the agreed deficit payments will reduce following the triennial valuation and they may increase or be extended.
In addition, a charge over the Humber power station has been provided as additional security for the trustees.
The Company also estimates that it will pay 90 million of employer contributions during 2012 at an average rate of 17% of pensionable pay.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS a Summary of principal share-based payment plans and movements in the number of shares and options outstanding Employee share schemes are designed to encourage participants to align their objectives with those of shareholders.
Centrica operates nine employee share schemes which gave rise to a charge of 40 million 2010: 48 million which represents 2% 2010: 3% of employee costs.
Over 70% of this share-based payment charge arose from three schemes: Deferred and Matching Share Scheme DMSS, Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS and Share Award Scheme SAS.
The DMSS and LTIS schemes have been described in the Remuneration Report on pages 55 and 56 respectively, with further details in note S7.
Share Award Scheme SAS Under the SAS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to selected employees at middle management levels, based on recommendation by the Chief Executive and the Group Director, Human Resources.
There is no contractual eligibility for SAS and each years award is made independently from previous awards.
Allocations are subject to no performance conditions and vest unconditionally subject to continued employment within the Group except where permitted by the rules of the scheme in two stages half of the award vesting after two years, the other half vesting after three years.
On vesting, additional shares are awarded or a cash payment is made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the allocations during the vesting period.
The fair value is therefore considered to be the market value at date of grant.
A reconciliation of total number of shares allocated under these three schemes is as follows: 2011 2010 Number of shares Thousands Thousands Balance at start of year 51,969 46,880 Granted 18,245 17,947 i Released 8,938 7,583 Forfeited 10,183 5,275 Balance at end of year 51,093 51,969 i For shares released during the period, the weighted average share price was 3.30 2010: 2.98. b Fair values and associated details of shares granted under the principal schemes 2011 2010 DMSS LTIS SAS DMSS LTIS SAS i Number of equity instruments granted in thousands 4,670 10,600 3,133 4,855 10,366 3,187 Weighted average fair value at date of grant 2.89 2.57 3.32 3.32 2.42 2.97 Expected performance lapses 0% n a n a 0% n a n a Vesting period 4 years 3 years 2.5 years 4 years 3 years 2.5 years ii Expected volatility n a 23% n a n a 30% n a Expected forfeitures 6% 16% 18% 10% 20% 18% ii Risk-free rate n a 1.9% n a n a 1.8% n a Average volatility of FTSE 100 n a 26% n a n a 27% n a iii Average cross-correlation of FTSE 100 n a 50% n a n a 48% n a i The number of equity instruments granted under DMSS is the estimate on the first day of the bonus year.
This differs from the table in section a which states the number of shares legally granted during the year.
ii The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a five year period.
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the expected option life.
iii The cross-correlation of the FTSE 100 has been obtained from a model which calculates the correlation between Centricas historical share price and each of the remaining FTSE 100 companies over the period commensurate with the performance period of the awards.

AUDITORS REMUNERATION CONTINUED It is the Groups policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancy and advisory projects.
Appointments are made taking into account factors including expertise, experience and cost.
In addition, the Audit Committee has approved a detailed policy defining the types of work for which the auditors can tender and the approvals required.
In the past, the auditors have been engaged on assignments in addition to their statutory audit duties where their expertise and experience with the Group are particularly important, including due diligence reporting and reporting accountant services on acquisitions.
COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a Commitments The Group procures commodities through a mixture of production from gas fields, power stations, wind farms and procurement contracts.
Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices.
They also include gas and electricity contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.
The commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts disclosed below are stated net of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts, where there is a right of set-off with the counterparty.
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
The commitments disclosed below are based on the minimum quantities of gas that the Group is contracted to buy at estimated future prices.
The commitments in this note differ in scope and in basis from the maturity analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note 25.
Whilst the commitments in relation to commodity purchase contracts include all purchase contracts, only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and included in note 25.
In addition, the volumes used in calculating principal values in note 25 are estimated using valuation techniques, rather than being based on minimum contractual quantities and in note 25 there is no offset of amounts receivable under commodity sales contracts where there is a right of set-off with the counterparty.

Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and so there is no commitment to a minimum lease payment 2010: nil.
Payments made for physical power are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents.
b Guarantees and indemnities In connection with the Groups energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay, provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in creditworthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
The Group has provided a number of guarantees and indemnities in respect of decommissioning costs: the most significant two indemnities relate to the decommissioning costs associated with the Morecambe and Statfjord fields.
These indemnities are to the previous owners of these fields.
Under the licence conditions of the fields, the previous owners will have exposure to the decommissioning costs should these liabilities not be fully discharged by the Group.
The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the associated gas field falls below a predetermined proportion of the estimated decommissioning cost.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant legal decommissioning notices in respect of the relevant fields have been revoked.
c Contingent liabilities There are no material contingent liabilities.
