The Group has implemented policies and methods of monitoring these risks as detailed for each risk as follows.
a Foreign exchange rate risk The Group has significant transactional currency exposures.
Such exposure arises from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
In 2011 approximately 41% of the OKD sales 2010: 41% were denominated in currencies other than its functional currency, whilst most of its costs were denominated in the functional currency.
No significant exposure arises on OKK level.
The Group aims to mitigate foreign currency exposure risks by entering into forward exchange rate contracts with financial institutions.
In 2010 and 2011 the Group entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the EUR denominated revenues of OKD which has CZK as its functional currency.
Hedging is managed at the Group level as part of the centralised treasury functions.
The aim is to minimize earnings volatility for the Group resulting from movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to cover up to 70% of its currency exposure.
It is the Groups policy to negotiate the terms of the derivatives to match the terms of the item at risk to maximize effectiveness of the derivative as a hedge of a foreign currency risk.
In 2011 and 2010 the Group applied hedge accounting for forward foreign exchange rate contracts used as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and commitments.
See Note 2e for the detailed application of the hedge accounting policies.
For the remaining derivatives instruments, hedge accounting is not applied.

In 2011 and 2010, changes in the fair value of forward exchange contracts applied for hedge accounting were accounted in the hedging reserve that is part of equity.
The reserve amounts to EUR 2,168 thousand as of 31 December 2011 2010: EUR 23,322 thousand.
The hedging reserve is recognised in the income statement when the hedged item portion of EUR inflows arising from coal and coke sales is recorded.
The amount recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
The impact in the income statement, net of tax during the year 2011 was EUR 3,980 thousand 2010: EUR 12,439 thousand.
b Interest rate risk The Group aims to minimize the exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates.
The Group has entered into forward interest rate swaps and collars to convert floating rate loans to fixed rate loans.
Specific amounts that the Group hedges are determined based on the prevailing market conditions and the current shape of the yield curve.
The specific terms and notional amounts of the swaps are determined based on managements assessment of future interest rates, as well as other factors, including short-term strategic initiatives.
As of 31 December 2011, the swaps and collars covered all of the Groups scheduled interest rate exposure pursuant to which the Group receives floating EURIBOR and PRIBOR in exchange for paying a fixed rate of interest.
In order to match the Groups exposure to floating interest rates resulting from the Groups significant cash balance, the Group has entered into a forward interest rate swap as a result of which the Group receives a fixed interest rate in exchange for paying a floating EURIBOR plus spread.
The fixed rate that the Group receives matches the fixed rate that the Group pays on its Senior Secured Notes.
For short-term loans outstanding, which comprise mainly revolving credit facility, no interest rate hedging is in place, mostly due to the nature of these credit lines compared to the long-term loans.
