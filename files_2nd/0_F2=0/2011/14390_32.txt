This measure of profit is described as headline and is used by management to measure and monitor performance.
The following items have been excluded from the headline measure: exceptional items, including income and expenditure relating to John Crane, Inc. asbestos litigation: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets acquired in a business combination the charge is a non-cash item, and the directors believe that it should be added back to give a clearer picture of underlying performance: and other financing gains and losses, which represent the potentially volatile gains and losses on derivatives and other financial instruments which do not fall to be hedge accounted under IAS 39.

The most recent valuations of the six principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2010.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2011.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values.
Contributions to the schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below: 2011 2010 UK US Other UK US Other Rate of increase in salaries n a n a 2.9% n a n a 3.0% Rate of increase for active deferred members 4.4% n a n a 4.1% n a n a Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.5% n a 1.3% 3.2% n a 1.4% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 3.5% n a 0.6% 3.2% n a 0.6% Discount rate 5.3% 5.1% 5.3% 5.4% 5.2% 5.2% Inflation rate 3.5% n a 1.8% 3.2% n a 1.8% Healthcare cost increases 5.0% n a 2.5% 5.0% n a 3.0% The assumptions used are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily occur in practice.
For countries outside the UK and USA these are disclosed as a weighted average.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal UK schemes are based on the SAPS All Birth year tables with relevant scaling factors based on recent actual mortality experience of members within each.
They allow for future improvements in life expectancy in line with 80% and 60% of the long cohort for males and females respectively with an annual 1% underpin.
The mortality assumptions used in the principal US schemes are based on the most recent mortality study table produced for retired pensioners in the US RP 2000 table.
The table selected allows for future mortality improvements and applies an adjustment for job classification blue collar versus white collar.
The assumptions give the following: Expected further years of life UK US Male Female Male Female Member who retires next year at age 65 22 24 19 21 Member, currently 45, when they retire in 20 years time 24 25 19 21 The assets in the scheme and the expected rates of return as at 31 July 2011 were: 31 July 2011 UK schemes US schemes Other countries Total Long-term Value Long-term Value Long-term Value rate of return m rate of return m rate of return m m Equities 7.9% 1,349.9 8.8% 224.1 9.5% 21.0 1,595.0 Government bonds 3.9% 300.8 3.8% 47.5 5.8% 6.0 354.3 Corporate bonds 5.3% 173.8 5.1% 141.2 4.7% 3.8 318.8 Insured liabilities 5.3% 491.3 491.3 Property 7.5% 176.4 3.8% 0.3 176.7 Other 4.1% 321.4 2.0% 15.1 336.5 Total market value 2,813.6 412.8 46.2 3,272.6 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 2,775.7 543.8 60.2 3,379.7 Surplus deficit 37.9 131.0 14.0 107.1 Unfunded pension plans 40.2 5.9 22.1 68.2 Post-retirement healthcare 8.5 13.0 1.0 22.5 Present value of unfunded obligations 48.7 18.9 23.1 90.7 Unrecognised asset due to surplus restriction 1.2 1.2 Net pension liability 10.8 149.9 38.3 199.0 Post-retirement assets 140.6 140.6 Post-retirement liabilities 151.4 149.9 38.3 339.6 Net pension liability 10.8 149.9 38.3 199.0 Where any individual scheme shows a recoverable surplus under IAS 19, this is disclosed on the balance sheet as a retirement benefit asset.
The IAS 19 surplus of any one scheme is not available to fund the IAS 19 deficit of another scheme.
The retirement benefit asset disclosed arises from the rights of the employers to recover the surplus at the end of the life of the scheme.
If the pension schemes were wound up while they had members, the schemes would need to buy out the benefits of all members.
The buy outs would cost significantly more than the present value of the scheme liabilities calculated in accordance with IAS 19.

Following completion of the triennial actuarial valuation of the principal UK defined benefit schemes SIPS and TIGPS as at 31 March 2009 and 5 April 2009, the Group agreed 10 year funding plans which require the following contributions: Cash contributions to SIPS of 36m a year for 10 years.
An initial investment of 25m in index-linked gilts held in an escrow account with further ongoing monthly investments of 2m for nine years.
The first such instalment was paid in August 2011.
The escrow account remains an asset of the Group see note 15 until 2020.
At that time the assets in escrow are allocated subject to the funding position of SIPS.
In addition, the escrow account may revert to the Group, should there be a surplus at an intervening triennial review.
A conditional cash contribution to the TIGPS of up to 50m is payable in May 2012, with further biannual payments of 8m thereafter.
These payments may not be made, or paid only in part, subject to the funding position of the Scheme in the six months ending 5 April 2012.
In addition to the funding plans referred to above, the Group agreed to make cash contributions in respect of any future service cost based on actuarial advice.
In 2012 the following cash contributions to the Groups principal defined benefit schemes are expected: 36m to SIPS: a conditional 50m to TIGPS: and approximately 20m to the US defined benefit scheme.
Including payments to smaller schemes around the world: expected cash payments for 2012 total approximately 110m.

Sensitivity The valuation of post-retirement schemes involves judgements about uncertain future events.
Sensitivities in respect of the key assumptions used to measure the principal pension schemes as at 31 July 2011 are set out below.
These sensitivities show the hypothetical impact of a change in each of the listed assumptions in isolation, with the exception of the sensitivity to inflation which incorporates the impact of certain correlating assumptions.
While each of these sensitivities holds all other assumptions constant, in practice such assumptions rarely change in isolation and the impacts may offset to some extent.

Investment In September 2011, the Trustees of the TIGPS invested approximately 147m in annuities which are matched with specific liabilities in the Scheme.
Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution plans across many countries.
In the UK a defined contribution plan has been offered since the closure of the UK defined benefit pension plans.
In the US a 401k defined contribution plan operates.
The total expense recognised in the income statement in respect of all these plans was 29.6m 2010: 27.1m.

The divisions now have global management and reporting for sales and marketing, product management and operations.
Both divisions now report and review performance using these global structures.
As required by IAS 36, following these reorganisations, the allocation of goodwill to CGUs for impairment testing was reviewed, and it was established that goodwill is now monitored, and should be tested for impairment, at a divisional level.
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment at least annually.
Value in use calculations are used to determine the recoverable amount of goodwill held allocated to each group of cash generating units CGU.
Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted cash-flows of the CGU.
These forecast cash-flows are based on the 2012 budget and the three year divisional strategic plan, which have both been approved by the Board.
The key assumptions used in value in use calculations are: Sales: projected sales are built up with reference to markets and product categories.
They incorporate past performance, historical growth rates and developments in key markets.
Margins: projected margins reflect historical performance and the impact of all completed projects to improve operational efficiency and leverage scale.
The projections do not include the impact of future restructuring projects to which the Group is not yet committed.
Discount rate: the discount rates have been calculated based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital and risks specific to the CGU being tested.
Pre-tax rates of 11.1% to 14.1% 2010: 9.8% to 12.8% have been used for the impairment testing.
Long term growth rates: As required by IAS 36, growth rates for the period after the detailed forecasts are based on the long-term GDP projections of the primary market for the CGU.
The average growth rate used in the testing was 2.42% 2010: 2.25%.
These rates do not reflect the long-term assumption used by the Group for investment planning.
The assumptions used in the impairment testing of significant CGUs are as follows: Smiths Medical Smiths Detection 2010 2010 2011 restated 2011 restated Net book value of goodwill m 497.2 512.5 406.9 372.9 Discount rate 11.2% 11.5% 11.2% 11.7% Period covered by management projections 5 years 5 years 5 years 5 years Long-term growth rates 2.47% 2.25% 2.00% 2.25% The 2010 information has been restated to reflect the new CGU structure.
The 2010 discount and growth rates are weighted averages of the rates used for testing in that year.
The remaining balance of the goodwill represents smaller individual amounts which have been allocated to smaller CGUs.
Sensitivity analysis performed around the base case assumptions has indicated that no reasonable changes in key assumptions would cause the carrying amount of any of the CGUs to exceed their respective recoverable amounts.
Other intangible assets The Group has no indefinite life intangible assets other than goodwill.
During the year impairment tests were carried out for development projects which have not yet started to be amortised, and acquired intangibles where there were indications of impairment.
Impairment charges of 5.5m have been incurred on intangible assets acquired in two business combinations.
Value in use calculations were used to determine the recoverable values of these assets.
The impairment charges have arisen because current and forecast profitability is below the levels originally projected.

21 Financial risk management The Groups international operations and debt financing expose it to financial risks which include the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, changes in debt market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity risks.
Treasury and risk management policies are set by the Board.
The policy sets out specific guidelines to manage foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage risk.
The instruments and techniques used to manage exposures include foreign currency derivatives, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
The central treasury function monitors financial risks and compliance with risk management policies.
The management of operational credit risk is discussed in note 17. a Foreign exchange risk Transactional currency exposure The Group is exposed to foreign currency risks arising from sales or purchases by businesses in currencies other than their functional currency.
It is Group policy that, when the net foreign exchange exposure to known future sales and purchases is material, this exposure is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The net exposure is calculated by adjusting the expected cash-flow for payments or receipts in the same currency linked to the sale or purchase.
This policy minimises the risk that the profits generated from the transaction will be affected by foreign exchange movements which occur after the price has been determined.
Hedge accounting documentation and effectiveness testing are only undertaken if it is cost effective.
The following table shows the currency of financial instruments.
It excludes loans and derivatives designated as net investment hedges.

Similarly, financial instruments included in trade and other payables comprise trade payables, accrued expenses and other creditors which qualify as financial instruments.
Based on the assets and liabilities held at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, the change in the fair value of financial instruments not designated as net investment hedges would have the following effect: Gain loss Gain loss Impact on profit recognised in Impact on profit recognised in for the year reserves for the year reserves 31 July 2011 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 31 July 2010 m m m m US dollar 5.9 3.4 1.5 1.8 Euro 1.8 4.2 1.0 2.9 Sterling 0.5 1.6 1.3 1.8 These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax and exclude the effect of quasi-equity intra-group loans.
Cash-flow hedging The Group uses foreign currency contracts to hedge future foreign currency sales and purchases.
At 31 July 2011 contracts with a nominal value of 217.7m 2010: 292.7m were designated as hedging instruments.
In addition, the Group had outstanding foreign currency contracts with a nominal value of 241.0m 2010: 152.1m which were being used to manage transactional foreign exchange exposures, but were not accounted for as cash-flow hedges.
The fair value of the contracts is disclosed in note 22.
The majority of hedged transactions will be recognised in the income statement in the same period that the cash-flows are expected to occur, with the only differences arising as a result of normal commercial credit terms on sales and purchases.
Of the foreign exchange contracts designated as hedging instruments 99.9% are for periods of 12 months or less 2010: 99.6%.
The movements in the cash-flow hedge reserve during the period are summarised in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 m m Brought forward cash-flow hedge reserve at start of year 0.6 1.8 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.2 Gains and losses on effective cash-flow hedges recognised in equity 0.4 2.3 Amounts removed from the hedge reserve and recognised in the following lines on the income statement revenue 0.2 0.1 cost of sales 0.4 0.9 administrative expenses 1.3 Carried forward cash-flow hedge reserve at end of year 0.3 0.6 119 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2011 Notes to the accounts continued 21 Financial risk management continued Translational currency exposure The Group has significant investments in overseas operations, particularly in the United States and Europe.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing primarily in the relevant currency or in some cases indirectly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps.
Net investment hedges The table below sets out the currency of loans and swap contracts designated as net investment hedges: At 31 July 2011 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 567.2 260.1 827.3 Currency swap contracts 192.6 45.6 39.2 107.8 192.6 612.8 299.3 107.8 827.3 At 31 July 2010 Sterling US$ Euro Other Total m m m m m Loans designated as net investment hedges 587.0 248.1 835.1 Currency swap contracts 206.7 32.4 39.2 135.1 206.7 619.4 287.3 135.1 835.1 At 31 July 2011 and 31 July 2010 swap contracts in other currencies hedged the Groups exposure to Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, Japanese yen and Chinese renminbi.
Of the contracts designated as net investment hedges, 54% 2010: 56% are current and the balance matures over the next three years 2010: three years.
The gains and losses that have been deferred in the net investment hedge reserve are shown in the table below: Year ended Year ended 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 m m Brought forward net investment hedge reserve at start of year 128.2 88.9 Amounts deferred in the period on effective net investment hedges 7.9 39.3 Carried forward net investment hedge reserve at end of year 120.3 128.2 The fair values of these net investment hedges are subject to exchange rate movements.
Based on the hedging instruments in place at the year end, if the specified currencies were to strengthen 10% while all other market rates remained constant, it would have the following effect: Loss Loss recognised in recognised in hedge reserve hedge reserve 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 m m US dollar 60.4 61.8 Euro 27.6 26.0 These movements would be fully offset by an opposite movement on the retranslation of the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries.
These sensitivities were calculated before adjusting for tax.
120 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2011 Group overview Chairman and Chief Executive Operating and financial review Risks and responsibility Governance Accounts 21 Financial risk management continued b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Groups current policy is to require interest rates to be fixed for greater than 60% of the level of net debt.
This is achieved primarily through fixed rate borrowings, and also through the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 July 2011 98.5% 2010: 91.5% of the Groups net borrowings were at fixed interest rates, after adjusting for interest rate swaps and the impact of short maturity derivatives designated as net investment hedges.
The weighted average interest rate on borrowings and cross-currency swaps at 31 July 2011, after interest rate swaps, is 5.5% 2010: 5.4%.
Interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities and the fair value of borrowings The following table shows the interest rate risk exposure of cash and borrowings.
The other financial assets and liabilities do not earn or bear interest and for all financial instruments except for borrowings the carrying value is not materially different from their fair value.
Cash and Cash and cash Fair value of cash Fair value of equivalents Borrowings borrowings equivalents Borrowings borrowings 31 July 2011 31 July 2011 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 31 July 2010 31 July 2010 m m m m m m Fixed interest adjusted for interest rate hedging Less than one year 1.2 1.2 1.3 1.3 Between one and five years 363.4 403.6 223.5 244.3 Greater than five years 414.2 463.0 566.9 643.7 Total fixed interest financial assets liabilities adjusted for interest rate hedging 778.8 867.8 791.7 889.3 Floating rate interest financial assets liabilities 243.1 211.3 211.3 156.4 218.0 218.0 Total interest bearing financial assets liabilities 243.1 990.1 1,079.1 156.4 1,009.7 1,107.3 Non-interest bearing assets liabilities in the same category 18.0 16.5 Total 261.1 990.1 1,079.1 172.9 1,009.7 1,107.3 Interest rate hedging The Group has designated US$150.0m interest rate swaps which mature on 28 January 2013 and 120.0m interest rate swaps which mature on 5 May 2017 as fair value hedges on the US Private placement and the Eurobond respectively which mature on the same dates.
These positions hedge the risk of variability in the fair value of borrowings arising from fluctuations in base rates.
The fair values of the hedging instruments are disclosed in note 22.
The effect of the swaps is to convert 196.3m 2010: 195.3m debt from fixed rate to floating rate.
Sensitivity of interest charges to interest rate movements The Group has exposure to sterling, US dollar and euro interest rates.
However the Group does not have a significant exposure to interest rate movements for any individual currency.
Based on the composition of net debt and foreign exchange rates at 31 July 2011, and taking into consideration all fixed rate borrowings and interest rate swaps in place, a one percentage point 100 basis points change in average floating interest rates for all three currencies would have a nil 2010: 0.2m impact on the Groups profit before tax.
c Financial credit risk The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not currently expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Board approved policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment grade long-term credit rating for cash deposits and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
In the normal course of business, the Group operates cash pooling systems, where a legal right of set-off applies.
The maximum credit risk exposure in the event of other parties failing to perform their obligations under financial assets, excluding trade and other receivables and derivatives, totals 292.7m at 31 July 2011 2010: 199.9m.
31 July 2011 31 July 2010 m m Cash at banks with at least a AAcredit rating 236.6 120.9 Cash at banks with a A credit rating 21.1 47.4 Cash at other banks 3.4 4.7 UK government bonds with a AAA credit rating note 15 29.1 25.2 Other investments 2.5 1.7 292.7 199.9 At 31 July 2011 the maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits and cash is 57.1m 2010: 41.6m, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for derivatives is 5.3m 2010: 6.8m.
These banks have AAand AA credit rating, respectively 2010: AA and AA.

Provision is made for the likely cost of after-sales support based on the recent past experience of individual businesses.
Reorganisation The restructuring of corporate and divisional headquarters was announced on 3 June 2008, and a second phase of this project was introduced in 2010.
At 31 July 2011 there is a provision of 4.7m 2010: 8.6m relating to the two phases of this project.
Reorganisation provisions include 1.8m 2010: 2.8m costs relating to restructuring supply arrangements following the automotive seals disposal.
These costs are expected to be spread over the next two years.
Disposal The disposal provision relates to warranties and other obligations in respect of the disposal of the Marine Systems and Aerospace businesses.
Most of the balance is expected to be utilised within the next five years.
Litigation John Crane, Inc. John Crane, Inc. JCI is one of many co-defendants in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from alleged exposure to, or use of, products previously manufactured which contained asbestos.
Until 2006, the awards, the related interest and all material defence costs were met directly by insurers.
In 2007, JCI secured the commutation of certain insurance policies in respect of product liability.
While JCI has excess liability insurance, the availability of such insurance and scope of the cover are currently the subject of litigation in the United States.
An adverse judgment at first instance from the Circuit Court of Cook County, Illinois is currently under appeal.
Pending the outcome of that litigation, JCI has begun to meet defence costs directly.
Provision is made in respect of the expected costs of defending known and predicted future claims and of adverse judgments in relation thereto, to the extent that such costs can be reliably estimated.
No account has been taken of recoveries from insurers as their nature and timing are not yet sufficiently certain to permit recognition as an asset for these purposes.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases consist of industrial sealing product, primarily packing and gaskets.
The asbestos was encapsulated within these products in such a manner that causes JCI to believe, based on tests conducted on its behalf, that the products were safe.
JCI ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
JCI continues to actively monitor the conduct and effect of its current and expected asbestos litigation, including the most efficacious presentation of its safe product defence, and intends to continue to resist these asbestos claims based upon this defence.
Approximately 202,000 claims against JCI have been dismissed before trial over the last 32 years.
JCI is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 101,000 claims.
Despite the large number of claims brought against JCI, it has had final judgments against it, after appeals, in only 107 cases over the period, and has had to pay awards amounting to approximately US$103m.
JCI has also incurred significant additional defence costs and, whilst the number of claims being filed against JCI and other defendants has been declining, the proportion of mesothelioma claims has increased, and JCIs ability to defend these cases successfully is likely to have a significant impact on its annual aggregate adverse judgment and defence costs.
124 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2011 Group overview Chairman and Chief Executive Operating and financial review Risks and responsibility Governance Accounts 23 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Litigation continued John Crane, Inc. continued The assumptions made in assessing the appropriate level of provision include: The period over which the expenditure can be reliably estimated.
The future trend of legal costs.
The rate of future claims filed.
The rate of successful resolution of claims.
The average amount of judgments awarded.
The provision is based on past history and allows for decreasing levels of new claims based on published tables of asbestos incidence projections and is determined using asbestos valuation experts, Bates White LLC.
In the current period the method used to calculate the expected costs of defending claims has been conformed to the approach used to calculate the expected cost of adverse judgments following the appointment of Bates White LLC to value both elements of JCIs exposure.
The projections use a 10 year time horizon see note 26, compared to time horizons of up to 16 years used in previous estimates, on the basis that Bates White LLC consider that there is substantial uncertainty in the asbestos litigation environment so probable expenditures are not reasonably estimable beyond this time horizon.
The Income Statement charge arising from movements in discounting see note 4 incorporates the impact of the change in the time frame of the projections.
The movement in the gross provision reflects the higher expected annual defence costs offset by the change in the time horizon.
However, because of the significant uncertainty associated with the future level of asbestos claims and of the costs arising out of related litigation, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and, as a result, the provision may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time if new information becomes available as a result of future events.
The provision in respect of JCI is a discounted pre-tax provision using discount rates, being the risk-free rate on US debt instruments for the appropriate period.
The deferred tax asset related to this provision is shown within the deferred tax balance note 6.
Set out below is the gross, discounted and post-tax information relating to this provision: 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 m m Gross provision 203.1 214.5 Discount 21.4 38.8 Discounted pre-tax provision 181.7 175.7 Deferred tax 50.6 47.4 Discounted post-tax provision 131.1 128.3 Other litigation The Group has on occasion been required to take legal action to protect its intellectual property and other rights against infringement.
It has also had to defend itself against proceedings brought by other parties, including product liability and insurance subrogation claims.
Provision is made for any expected costs and liabilities in relation to these proceedings where appropriate, though there can be no guarantee that such provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will accurately predict the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
Apart from that relating to JCI, none of the other provisions is discounted.

In the year the Company issued nil 2010: 558,754 shares to the Trust, and the Trust purchased 700,892 2010: nil shares in the market.
The capital redemption reserve, revaluation reserve and merger reserve arose from: share repurchases: revaluations of property, plant and equipment: and merger accounting for business combinations before the adoption of IFRS, respectively.
125 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2011 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Reserves continued Capital management Capital employed comprises total equity adjusted for goodwill recognised directly in reserves, net post-retirement benefit assets and liabilities and net debt.
The efficiency of the allocation of the capital to the divisions is monitored through the headline return on capital employed ROCE.
This ratio is calculated over a rolling 12-month period and is the percentage that headline operating profit comprises of monthly average capital employed.
The capital structure is based on the directors judgement of the balance required to maintain flexibility while achieving an efficient cost of capital.
The Group has a target gearing, calculated on a market value basis, of approximately 20%.
At the balance sheet date the Group had gearing of 15% 2010: 19%.
As part of its capital management the Group strategy is to maintain a solid investment grade credit rating to ensure access to the widest possible sources of financing and to minimise the resulting cost of capital.
At 31 July 2011 the Group had a credit rating of BBB Baa2 2010: BBB Baa2 negative outlook with Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
The credit rating is managed through the following cash-flow targets: headline operating cash conversion of greater than 80% and a ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA of less than two.
The Board aims for dividend cover of around 2.5 times, to ensure that the Group retains sufficient cash to finance investment in growth.

26 Contingent liabilities and commitments John Crane, Inc. As stated in note 23, John Crane, Inc. JCI is involved in numerous lawsuits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The JCI products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of JCI, the products were safe.
Provision has been made for future defence costs and the cost of adverse judgments expected to occur.
The Group anticipates that asbestos litigation will continue beyond the period covered by this provision: however, because of the uncertainty surrounding the outcome of litigation beyond this period, the costs cannot be reliably estimated.
Other contingent liabilities and commitments In the ordinary course of its business, the Group is subject to litigation such as product liability claims, employee disputes and other kinds of lawsuits, and faces different types of legal issues in different jurisdictions.
The high level of activity in the US, for example, exposes the Group to the likelihood of various types of litigation commonplace in that country, such as mass tort and class action litigation, and legal challenges to the scope and validity of patents.
These types of proceedings or the threat of them are also used to create pressure to encourage negotiated settlement of disputes.
Any claim brought against the Group with or without merit, could be costly to defend.
These matters are inherently difficult to quantify.
In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on best estimates and management judgement but there can be no guarantee that these provisions which may be subject to potentially material revision from time to time will result in an accurate prediction of the actual costs and liabilities that may be incurred.
There are also contingent liabilities in respect of litigation for which no provisions are made.
At 31 July 2011, contingent liabilities, comprising bonds and guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounted to 137.8m 2010: 143.5m, including pension commitments of 43.1m 2010: 40.6m.
From time to time the Group co-operates with relevant authorities in investigating business conduct issues.
The Group is not aware of any issues which are expected to generate material financial exposures.

Headline operating cash-flow is net cash inflow from headline operating activities less capital expenditure.
See note 3 for a description of headline profit measures.
Free cash-flow is cash-flow after interest and tax but before acquisitions, financing activities and dividends.
The tables below reconcile these two measures to statutory cash-flow measures.

The acquired businesses are the Indian and Brazilian distributors for Smiths Detection, and this will continue to be their principal business activity.
The acquisitions give Smiths Detection direct control over sales of its products in two major fast-growing economies.
The consideration for these acquisitions comprises: cash of 12.0m: fixed deferred consideration of which 1.5m is outstanding at 31 July 2011.
This is due to be paid over the next two years: contingent consideration based on the sales the acquired businesses achieve over the next five years.
This consideration is denominated in US dollars.
The fair value of $14.7m at acquisition has been calculated using probability weighted forecasts of potential future sales by target customers and market sectors.
The maximum potential contingent consideration payable is $23.0m: and non-equity shares in one of the new subsidiaries, which were valued at 3.5m on acquisition.
From the date of acquisition to 31 July 2011, the acquisitions contributed 15.1m to revenue, 1.6m to headline profit before taxation and 0.1m to profit before taxation.
If Smiths had acquired the businesses at the beginning of the financial period, the acquisitions would have contributed 19.4m to revenue and 1.7m to headline profit before taxation.
The intangible assets recognised comprise 4.1m in respect of customer relationships, orders and contractual non-compete arrangements with the vendors.
The assets recognised include the current value of the maintenance contracts acquired.
Goodwill represents the value of future growth opportunities in these markets.
The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The values set out below are provisional pending finalisation of the fair values attributable and working capital adjustments, and will be finalised in the year ending 31 July 2012.

The nature of the principal schemes and plans, including general conditions, is set out below: 2008 Value Sharing Plan 2008 VSP The VSP is a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders in July 2008 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels.
Corporate participants will be rewarded under the VSP for value creation at a Group level, whereas the executives with divisional responsibilities will be rewarded for value creation within the division for which they are responsible.
For the Group scheme, one-third of the award will depend on the growth in Smiths TSR over and above the median for the companies comprising the FTSE 100 excluding financial services companies and the remaining two-thirds of each award will be determined by the growth in internal value in excess of fixed rate.
The growth in internal value is calculated as follows: adjusted profit before tax PBT times the ratio of PBT to market capitalisation determined at the date of grant plus net equity cash-flows to shareholders.
The divisional awards will depend on meeting an internal value growth target set for the division in which the participant works.
The performance conditions are measured over three-year and four-year periods commencing with the financial year 2008 09.
For the Group scheme, the growth in internal value is tested against a hurdle rate of 9.5% a year.
2010 Value Sharing Plan 2010 VSP The 2010 VSP is a long-term incentive plan approved by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 16 November 2010 rewarding executives for value creation at Group and Divisional levels.
The awards have the same structure and calculation methods as the 2008 VSP.
The performance conditions are measured over a three-year period commencing with the financial year 2010 11, and the Group scheme hurdle rate is 8.5% a year.
128 Smiths Group plc Annual Report 2011 Group overview Chairman and Chief Executive Operating and financial review Risks and responsibility Governance Accounts 30 Employee share schemes continued Smiths Group Co-Investment Plan CIP Under the CIP, as introduced in October 2005, the executive directors and senior executives are able, if invited, to use their after tax bonus or 25% of their basic salary after tax, whichever is the greater, to invest in the Companys shares at the prevailing market price.
At the end of a three year period, if the executive is still in office and provided the performance test is passed, matching shares will be awarded in respect of any invested shares retained for that period.
The number of matching shares to be awarded is determined by the Remuneration Committee at the end of the year in which the bonus is earned by reference to annual bonus, and other corporate financial criteria.
The maximum award will not exceed the value, before tax, of the bonus or salary invested in shares by the executive.
Vesting of matching shares will occur and the matching shares will be released at the end of the three year period if the Groups Return on Capital Employed ROCE over the Performance Period exceeds the Groups weighted average cost of capital WACC over the Performance Period by an average margin of at least 1% per annum.
In July 2008 the CIP was amended.
From 2009 participants have been required to invest 50% of their post tax bonus in purchased shares.
The performance conditions have been expanded to include an enhanced performance condition of ROCE exceeding WACC by an average margin of 3% per annum.
If the enhanced performance condition is met, two matching shares will be issued for every purchased share.
The average closing share price over the financial year was 1,240.24p 2010: 1,000.61p.
There has been no change to the effective option price of any of the outstanding options during the period.
Exercisable weighted Weighted average average Options Options exercise price Total shares remaining exercisable at exercisable at for options under option contractual life 31 July 2011 31 July 2010 exercisable at Range of exercise prices 000 months 000 000 31 July 2011 0.00 2.00 3,197 18 0.00 2.01 6.00 532 27 2 2 5.69 6.01 10.00 2,786 40 2,106 1,667 8.19 10.01 14.00 1,120 73 907 51 10.97 For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the share-based payment charge, the Binomial option pricing model has been used for most schemes and the Monte Carlo method is used for schemes with total shareholder return performance targets.
The key assumptions used in the models for 2011 and 2010 are volatility of 30% 2010: 30% and dividend yield of 3.33% 2010: 3.75%.
Assumptions on expected volatility and expected option term have been made on the basis of historical data, for the period corresponding with the vesting period of the option.
These generated a weighted average fair value for CIP of 12.40 2010: 9.45 and VSP of 13.86 2010: 11.21.
The fair value disclosed for the CIP award treats the two matching shares as separate options.
Included within staff costs is an expense arising from share-based payment transactions of 13.8m 2010: 11.3m, of which 13.8m 2010: 10.3m relates to equity-settled share-based payment.
At 31 July 2011 the creditor relating to cash-settled schemes is 0.6m 2010: 0.9m.
31 Events after the balance sheet date On 2 September 2011 Smiths Interconnect agreed to purchase Power Holdings Inc. a leading designer and manufacturer of specialist power distribution, conditioning and monitoring systems.
The purchase price of $235m will be subject to post closing adjustments with respect to working capital at completion.
The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
On 17 August 2011 John Crane agreed to purchase the business and assets of Turbo Components and Engineering Inc. TCE which services, repairs and builds replacement bearings and seals used in critical rotating equipment.
The purchase price of $20m will be subject to post closing adjustments.
TCE has gross assets of approximately $3.2m and expected sales of $10m for the current calendar year.
This acquisition is subject to regulatory approval.
