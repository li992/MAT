BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 63 Notes to the financial statements 1 Authorisation of financial statements Ophir Energy plc the Company and the ultimate parent of the Group is a public limited company incorporated, domiciled and listed in England.
Its registered offices are situated at 55 Grosvenor Street, London W1K 3HY.
Ophir Energys business is oil and gas exploration with an extensive portfolio of exploration interests in Africa.
The Groups and Companys financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 20 March 2012 and the Statement of Financial Position was signed on the Boards behalf by Mr Nicholas Smith and Dr Nick Cooper.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies 2.1 Basis of preparation and statement of compliance The Groups and Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis except for revaluation of certain derivative instruments measured at fair value.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US Dollars rounded to the nearest thousand dollars US$000 except as otherwise indicated.
Comparative figures for the period to 31 December 2010 are for the year ended on that date.
2.2 Significant accounting policies New and Amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations as of 1 January 2011: IAS 24 Related Party Transactions Amendment IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards issued 2010 When the adoption of the Standard or Interpretation is deemed to have an impact on the financial statements or the financial position and performance of the Group, its impact is described below: Impact from changes to accounting policies as a result of amendments to IAS 24 Related Party Transactions, IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and Improvement to IFRSs.
IAS 24 Related Party Transactions Amendment alters the definition of a related party to emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships and clarifies the circumstances in which persons and key management personnel affect related party relationships of an entity.
In addition, the amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for transactions with government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same government as the reporting entity.
The adoption of the amendment has altered the identification of related parties by the Group.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation alters the definition of a financial liability to enable entities to classify rights issues and certain options or warrants as equity instruments.
The amendment is applicable if the rights are given pro rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entitys non-derivative equity instruments, to acquire a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments for a fixed amount in any currency.
The amendment has had no effect on the financial position or performance of the Group but will alter the Groups future accounting if any such instruments are issued.
Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 64 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued Improvements to IFRS issued In May 2010 are the third omnibus of amendments to the IABs standards and issued primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies but no impact on the financial position or performance of the Group.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations: The measurement options available for non-controlling interest NCI were amended.
Only components of NCI that constitute a present ownership interest that entitles their holder to a proportionate share of the entitys net assets in the event of liquidation shall be measured at either fair value or at the present ownership instruments proportionate share of the acquirees identifiable net assets.
All other components are to be measured at their acquisition date fair value.
The amendments to IFRS 3 are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011.
The Group however adopted these as of 1 January 2011 and changed its accounting policy accordingly as the amendment was issued to eliminate unintended consequences that may arise from the adoption of IFRS 3.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendment clarifies that an entity may present an analysis of each component of other comprehensive income maybe either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the financial statements.
Other amendments resulting from Improvements to IFRSs to the following standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, financial position or performance of the Group: IFRS 3 Business Combinations Contingent consideration arising from business combination prior to adoption of IFRS 3 as revised in 2008 IFRS 3 Business Combinations Unreplaced and voluntarily replaced share-based payment awards IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes determining the fair value of award credits IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments Standards and Interpretations issued but not yet effective Standards issued but not yet effective at the date of these financial statements are listed below.
EFFECTIVE DATE for periods beginning on or after IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income 1 July 2012 IAS 12 Income Taxes Recovery of Underlying Assets 1 January 2012 IAS 19 Employee Benefits Amendment 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Separate Financial Statements as revised in 2011 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures as revised in 2011 1 January 2013 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Enhanced Derecognition Disclosure Requirements 1 July 2011 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2013 IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements 1 January 2013 IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements 1 January 2013 IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities 1 January 2013 IFRS 13 Fair Value measurement 1 January 2013 The impact of the adoption of the above standards has not been assessed by the Group.
BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 65 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 2.3 Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and the entities it controls its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December each year.
Basis of consolidation from 1 January 2010 Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Control comprises the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the investee so as to obtain benefit from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights: currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights: or by way of contractual agreement.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company, using consistent accounting policies.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising therefrom, are eliminated.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it i derecognises the assets including goodwill and liabilities of the subsidiary: ii derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest: iii derecognises the cumulative translation differences, recorded in equity: iv recognises the fair value of the consideration received: v recognises the fair value of any investment retained: and vi recognises any surplus or deficit in profit and loss: vii reclassifies the parents share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit and loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Non-controlling interests Non-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable, directly and indirectly, to the parent company and is presented separately within the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from equity attributable to owners of the parent.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
Basis of consolidation prior to 1 January 2010 Certain of the above-mentioned requirements were applied on a prospective basis.
The following differences, however, are carried forward in certain instances from the previous basis of consolidation: Non-controlling interest represents the portion of profit or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Acquisitions of non-controlling interests, prior to 1 January 2010, were accounted for using the equity concept method.
Losses incurred by the Group were attributed to the minority interest until the balance was reduced to nil.
Any further excess losses were attributed to the parent, unless the non-controlling interest had a binding obligation to cover these.
2.4 Exploration and evaluation expenditure The Company applies the successful efforts method of accounting for the exploration and evaluation E&E costs as permitted by IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources.
All costs incurred after the rights to explore an area have been obtained, such as licence acquisition costs, geological and geophysical costs and other direct costs of E&E are accumulated and capitalised as E&E assets, in well, field or licence-specific exploration cost centres as appropriate pending determination.
Costs other than payments to acquire the legal right to explore incurred prior to acquiring rights to explore and general exploration costs not specific to any particular licence or prospect are charged directly to the income statement.
Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 66 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued E&E assets are not amortised prior to the determination of the results of exploration activity.
At completion of evaluation activities, if technical and commercial feasibility is demonstrated then, following recognition of commercial reserves, the carrying value of the relevant E&E asset will be reclassified as a development and production asset, subject to the carrying value of the relevant E&E asset being assessed for impairment.
If, on completion of evaluation of prospects or licences, it is not possible to determine technical feasibility and commercial viability or if the legal right to explore expires or if the Group decides not to continue E&E activity, then the costs of such unsuccessful E&E are written off to the income statement in the period of that determination.
The carrying value of E&E assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Where this is indicated, management will assess the recoverability of the carrying value of the asset.
The review is based upon a status report detailing the Groups intention for development of the asset.
Where it cannot be recovered via successful development or sale, all costs are written off.
2.5 Intangibles Intangible assets are initially measured at cost.
Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful life and tested for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
2.6 Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment, which comprises furniture and fittings and computer equipment, is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such cost includes costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on property, plant and equipment calculated using the straight line method at rates to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the Balance Sheet date, of each asset over expected useful lives ranging from 3 to 10 years.
2.7 Investment in subsidiaries The Company holds monetary balances with its subsidiaries of which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Such balances are considered to be part of the Companys net investment in its subsidiaries.
The carrying values of investments in subsidiaries are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
2.8 Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount.
Where the time value of money is material, receivables are carried at amortised cost.
Allowance is made when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to recover balances in full.
Evidence on non-recoverability may include indications that the debtor or group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or default or delinquency in repayments.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
The amount of the impairment loss is the receivable carrying amount compared to the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.
BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 67 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 2.9 Inventories Inventories which comprise drilling consumables are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost is determined by using weighted average cost method and comprises direct purchase costs, cost of transportation and other related expenses.
2.10 Cash and short-term deposits Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank, in hand and short-term deposits with original maturity dates of up to 12 months.
2.11 Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are carried at amortised cost.
They represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end of the financial year that are unpaid and arise when the Group becomes obligated to make future payments in respect of the purchase of those goods and services.
The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.
2.12 Provisions A provision is recognised when the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, expected future cash flows are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to unwinding the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
2.13 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits The Group does not operate its own pension plan but makes pension or superannuation contributions to private funds of its employees which are defined contribution plans.
The cost of providing such benefits are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
2.14 Employee benefits Wages, salaries, annual leave and sick leave Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and accumulating sick leave expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are recognised in respect of employees services up to the reporting date.
They are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled.
Liabilities for non-accumulating sick leave are recognised when the leave is taken and are measured at the rates paid or payable.
Long service leave The liability for long service leave is recognised and measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date using the projected unit credit method.
Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service.
Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on national government bonds with terms to maturity and currencies that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows.
2.15 Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
2.16 Interest-bearing borrowing All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when liabilities are derecognised as well as through the amortisation process.
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 68 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability.
The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
2.17 Leases The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.
The Group has leases where the Lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset.
Such leases are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
2.18 Interests in joint ventures The Group has a number of contractual arrangements with other parties which represent joint ventures.
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake economic activity.
Where a Group company undertakes its activities under joint venture arrangements the Groups share of jointly controlled assets, liabilities and related income and expenses are included in the financial statements in their respective classification categories.
The Groups interests in joint ventures, which are in the form of jointly controlled assets, are identified in Note 23.
The Group has a number of interests in joint ventures, which are considered jointly controlled assets, whereby the venturers have a contractual arrangement that establishes joint control over the economic activities of the asset.
The agreement requires unanimous agreement for financial and operating decisions among the venturers.
The Group recognises its interest in the joint venture using the proportionate consolidation method.
The Group combines its proportionate share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses of the joint venture with similar items, line by line, in its consolidated financial statements.
The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared for the same reporting period as the Group.
Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Adjustments are made in the Groups consolidated financial statements to eliminate the Groups share of intragroup balances, transactions and unrealised gains and losses on such transactions between the Group and its joint venture.
Losses on transactions are recognised immediately if the loss provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment loss.
The joint venture is proportionately consolidated until the date on which the Group ceases to have joint control over the joint venture.
Upon loss of joint control the Group measures and recognises its remaining investment at its fair value.
Any difference between the carrying amount of the former joint controlled entity upon loss of joint control and the fair value of the remaining investment and proceeds from disposal are recognised in the income statement.
When the remaining investment constitutes significant influence, it is accounted for as investment in an associate.
2.19 Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received and receivable, excluding discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales taxes or duty.
The specific recognition criteria described below must also be met before revenue is recognised: Interest income Interest income is recognised as it accrues using the effective interest rate method, that is, the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.
BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 69 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 2.20 Borrowing costs Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be prepared for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are expensed in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
2.21 Share-based payments The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined with reference to the market value of the underlying shares using a pricing model appropriate to the circumstances which requires judgements as to the selection of both the valuation model and inputs.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition or a non-vesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other vesting conditions are satisfied.
At each Balance Sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated on the basis of the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
For equity-settled share-based payment transactions with third parties, the goods or services received are measured at the date of receipt by reference to their fair value with a corresponding entry in equity.
If the Group cannot reliably estimate the fair value of the goods or services received, their value is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instruments granted.
2.22 Foreign currency translation The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined on an individual basis according to the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency by applying the spot exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the income statement.
The assets and liabilities of the Company and those foreign operations whose functional currency is other than that of the presentation currency of Ophir are translated into the presentation currency, at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.
The resulting exchange differences are taken directly to a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 70 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 Basis of preparation and significant accounting policies continued 2.23 Income taxes Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Current income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will be available to allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise deferred income tax is recognised in the income statement.
2.24 Impairment The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an intangible asset or item of property plant & equipment may be impaired.
If any indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for is required, the Group estimates the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units CGU fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
When the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available.
If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used.
These calculations are corroborated by valuation multiples, quoted share prices for publicly traded subsidiaries or other available fair value indicators.
The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations, which are prepared separately for each of the Groups CGUs to which the individual assets are allocated.
These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years.
For longer periods, a long-term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year.
Impairment losses of continuing operations, including impairment on inventories, are recognised in the income statement in expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset, except for a property previously revalued and the revaluation was taken to other comprehensive income.
In this case, the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
BUSINESS REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Ophir Energy plc Annual Report 2011 71 3 Significant accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Estimates and assumptions are continuously evaluated and are based on managements experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
However, actual outcomes can differ from these estimates.
The Group has used estimates and assumptions in deriving certain figures within the financial statements.
Such accounting estimates may not equate with the actual results which will only be known in time.
The key areas of estimation are noted below with further details of the assumptions used listed in the relevant note.

The plan provided for a total of 1,450,000 options to acquire ordinary shares at 1p per share to be issued to eligible employees.
The Scheme was terminated on 24 November 2005 and all options issued under the scheme have fully vested.
Ophir Energy Company 2006 Share Option Plan On 5 April 2006 the Board resolved to establish the Ophir Energy Company Limited 2006 Share Option Plan.
Any employee of the Company or any Subsidiary or any Director of the Company or any subsidiary who is required to devote substantially the whole of his working time to his duties is eligible to participate under the Plan.
At the grant date the Board of Directors determine the vesting terms, if any, subject to the proviso that no more than one half of the options become exercisable on the first and second anniversaries of the date of grant and any performance conditions are satisfied.
Options have an exercise period of 10 years from the date of grant.
Ophir Energy 2011 Long-term Incentive Share Option Plan On 26 May 2011 the Board resolved to establish the Ophir Energy 2011 Long-term Incentive Share Option Plan.
This was introduced to give awards to Directors and senior staff subject to outperforming a comparator group of similarly focused oil and gas exploration companies in terms of shareholder return over a three year period.
The Plan awards a number of shares to Directors and staff based on a multiple of salary.
However, these shares only vest after a three year period and the full award is made only if Ophir has performed in the top quartile when compared against a selected peer group of upstream oil and gas companies.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices WAEP of, and movements in, share options during the period for the above schemes.
These are denominated in Pounds Sterling and have been translated to US Dollars using the closing exchange rate for presentation purposes.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as there is not sufficient certainty that taxable income will be realised in the future due to the nature of the Groups international exploration activities and the long lead times in either developing or otherwise realising exploration assets.
e Other unrecognised temporary differences The Group has other unrecognised temporary differences in the UK, Australia and various African countries totalling US$148,534,880 2010: US$130,340,205 in respect of provisions and exploration expenditure for which deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
f Change in corporation tax rate Deferred tax has been calculated at the rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The main United Kingdom rate of corporation tax decreased from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011, and legislation to reduce the rate to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012 has been substantively enacted during the year.
In addition, the United Kingdom Government announced on 23 March 2011 as part of its 2011 Budget that the corporation tax rate was to be reduced to 24% from 1 April 2013 and to 23% from 1 April 2014.
These reductions have not been reflected in the deferred tax figures as legislation had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

The Group has taken the view that the action is without merit and accordingly has estimated that no liability will arise as a result of proceedings and no provision for any liability has been made in these financial statements.
26 Borrowing facilities The Company and the Group had no borrowing facilities as at 31 December 2011 2010: Nil.
27 Financial risk management and financial instruments Strategy and objectives The Groups principal financial assets and liabilities comprise cash and short-term deposits and various items, such as receivables and trade and other payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage short-term cash flow and provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups senior management oversees the management of financial risk and the Board of Directors has established an Audit Committee to assist in the identification and evaluation of significant financial risks.
Where appropriate, consultation is sought with an external advisor to determine the appropriate response to identified risks.
The Group does not trade in derivatives for speculative purposes.
The main risks that could adversely affect the Groups financial assets, liabilities or future cash flows are foreign currency, interest rate, liquidity and credit risks.
a Significant accounting policies Details of significant accounting policies and methods adopted in respect of each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in Note 2 to the financial statements.
b Credit risk Credit risk refers to the risk that a third party will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Company or Group.
The Company and Groups maximum exposure to credit risk of third parties is the aggregate of the carrying value of its security deposits, cash and short-term deposits, and trade and other receivables.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties, and as such collateral is not requested nor is it the Groups policy to securitise its trade and other receivables In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups experience of bad debts has not been significant.
