Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the United Kingdom, the Barratt Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme which, with effect from 30 June 2009, ceased to offer future accrual of defined benefit pensions.
Alternative defined contribution pension arrangements are in place for current employees.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 30 November 2010 is being carried out by the Trustees.
The preliminary results of this valuation have been updated to 30 June 2011 by a qualified independent actuary.
Under the current funding agreement with the Trustees the Group has agreed to make contributions to the Scheme of 13.3m per annum until 30 November 2015 to address the Schemes deficit.
The Group also continues to meet the Schemes administration expenses, death in service premiums and Pension Protection Fund levy.
The Group and Trustees are currently discussing the results of the actuarial valuation at 30 November 2010 and expect to reach a conclusion on this in advance of the statutory deadline which is 29 February 2012.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 1.1m 2010: 1.1m.
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair bid value.
The liabilities of the Scheme have been calculated at each balance sheet date using the following assumptions: Principal actuarial assumptions 2011 2010 Weighted average assumptions to determine benefit obligations Discount rate 5.50% 5.40% Rate of compensation increase N A N A Rate of price inflation 3.50% 3.20% Weighted average assumptions to determine net cost Discount rate 5.40% 6.30% Expected long-term rate of return on plan assets 5.96% 6.31% Rate of compensation increase N A N A Rate of price inflation 3.20% 3.40% Members are assumed to exchange 10% of their pension for cash on retirement.
The assumptions have been chosen by the Group following advice from Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, the Groups actuarial advisers.
The following table illustrates the life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the mortality assumptions used to calculate the Scheme liabilities: Assumptions Male Female Retired member born in 1935 life expectancy at age 65 21.6 years 24.8 years Non-retired member born in 1965 life expectancy at age 65 24.5 years 27.8 years The base mortality assumptions are based upon the PA92 mortality tables.
The Group has carried out a mortality investigation of the Schemes membership to ensure that this is an appropriate assumption.
Allowance for future increases in life expectancy is made in line with the medium cohort projection, with an underpin on the annual rate of improvement in mortality of 1%.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the actual asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.
The actual return on Scheme assets was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Actual return on Scheme assets 30.7 28.4 The five-year history of experience adjustments arising on Scheme liabilities assets was as follows: 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Present value of defined benefit obligations m 250.6 248.3 201.9 208.8 232.8 Fair value of Scheme assets m 238.8 202.2 170.4 171.6 167.9 Deficit in the Scheme m 11.8 46.1 31.5 37.2 64.9 Experience adjustment in Scheme liabilities m 6.8 11.4 13.2 Percentage of Scheme liabilities % 2.7 5.5 5.7 Experience adjustment in Scheme assets m 18.5 17.6 20.5 17.3 7.6 Percentage of Scheme assets % 7.7 8.7 12.0 10.1 4.5 Amount recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income m 22.0 26.3 14.1 20.1 13.4 Percentage of Scheme assets % 9.2 13.0 8.3 11.7 8.0 The cumulative amount of actuarial gains and losses since 30 June 2005 recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income is a gain of 15.1m.
