78 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 DIRECTORS REPORT ON REMUNERATION.
Participants do not receive dividends on unvested awards.
The share price on the date of grant for the 2011 awards was 116.6p.
These awards vest on the third anniversary of the award date, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
The awards granted in 2009, 2010 and 2011 were restructured as nil cost options during 2011 to permit exercise of the options at any point between the vesting date and the fifth anniversary of grant.
There has been no amendment to the original performance conditions or performance period as a result of this change.
Details of how awards vested and latest position for outstanding awards Performance share plan PSP The 2008 PSP vested in April 2011 at 16.6% of the total award 200%.
The TSR conditions were not met for the half of the award that was based on the FTSE 100 and vested only to the extent of 16.6% in relation to the bespoke benchmark.
For information, the 2009 award of PSP is forecast to vest in full in May 2012.
However, in line with the ABI guidelines, the 2009 award was reduced from the maximum award of 200% to 150% to reect the economic environment and the fall in share price at the time.
In line with policy, the Committee has also carefully reviewed the Companys underlying performance over the performance period to March 2012.
This has included considerations of partnerships entered into and maintained, cost management, capital management and risk.
The Committee feels the Company performance has been strong over the period and currently sees no reason not to allow the PSP to vest in accordance with the TSR out-turn.
However, the Committee will review the final vesting again once the performance period has ended.
