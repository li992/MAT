44 2011 Report of the Directors 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS Management has determined the operating segments based on the reports reviewed by the Executive Committee that are used to make strategic decisions.
The Committee considers the business principally from a geographical perspective, but with the RB Pharmaceuticals business RBP being managed separately given the significantly different nature of the business and the different risks and rewards associated with it.
The geographical segments, being Europe, NAA North America and Australia and Developing Markets, derive their revenue primarily from the manufacture and sale of branded products in health & personal care and household cleaning, whilst RB Pharmaceuticals derives its revenue exclusively from the sales of buprenorphine-based prescription drugs used to treat opiate dependence.
A separate segment for the acquired business SSL International plc SSL was disclosed in 2010, the year of acquisition.
Following integration SSL is now reported as part of the Groups existing geographical segments.
Accordingly this has resulted in a re-allocation of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported as SSL as at, and for the year ended 31 December 2010: the majority of which have now been reported under the Europe segment and within the health & personal care product group.
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on net revenue and adjusted operating profit.
This measurement basis excludes the effects of exceptional items.
Finance income and expense are not allocated to segments, as they are managed on a central Group basis.
Inter-segment revenue is charged according to internally agreed pricing terms that are designed to be equivalent to an arms length basis, and have been consistently applied throughout 2010 and 2011.
Reportable Segments The segment information provided to the Executive Committee for the reportable segments for the year ended 31 December 2011 is as follows: RB Developing PharmaEurope NAA Markets ceuticals Corporate Elimination Total 2011 m m m m m m m Total gross segment net revenue 4,195 2,411 2,461 762 344 9,485 Inter-segment revenue 186 9 149 344 Net revenue 4,009 2,402 2,312 762 9,485 Depreciation and amortisation 76 33 33 15 157 Operating profit adjusted 908 652 399 518 10 - 2,487 Exceptional items 92 Operating profit 2,395 Net finance expense 19 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 2,376 RB Developing PharmaEurope NAA Markets ceuticals Corporate Elimination Total 2010 restated m m m m m m m Total gross segment net revenue 3,609 2,324 1,950 737 167 8,453 Inter-segment revenue 119 1 47 167 Net revenue 3,490 2,323 1,903 737 8,453 Depreciation and amortisation 74 31 24 15 144 Operating profit adjusted 823 599 278 531 2,231 Exceptional items 101 Operating profit 2,130 Net finance income 6 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 2,136 Restated for the re-allocation of SSL revenue and expenses to geographical segments.
Adjusted to exclude the impact of exceptional items.
The profits arising on inter-segment sales are insignificant.
Items of income and expense which are not part of the results and financial position of the reported segments, and therefore reported to the CODM outside of the individual segment financial information, are shown in the Corporate segment.
For the year ended 31 December 2011 this includes a profit on disposal of intangibles and regulatory costs with a net effect of 10m 2010: a profit on disposal of intangibles offset by an expense relating to legal matters: net impact nil.
Impairment charges of 4m 2010: nil are included within depreciation and amortisation for Developing Markets.
2011 45 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED The Executive Committee reviews net working capital by segment and other assets and liabilities on a Group basis.
The split of assets and liabilities by segment provided to the Executive Committee is as follows: RB Developing PharmaEurope NAA Markets ceuticals Total 2011 m m m m m Inventories 336 187 233 135 891 Trade and other receivables 568 267 379 178 1,392 Total segment assets 904 454 612 313 2,283 Trade and other payables 1,245 549 761 186 2,741 RB Developing PharmaEurope NAA Markets ceuticals Total 2010 restated m m m m m Inventories 336 133 185 72 726 Trade and other receivables 661 224 342 110 1,337 Total segment assets 997 357 527 182 2,063 Trade and other payables 1,252 499 594 129 2,474 Restated for the re-allocation of SSL assets and liabilities to geographical segments and the fair value adjustments disclosed in note 29.
The assets and liabilities are allocated based upon the operations of the segment and the physical location of the asset or liability.
There are a number of unallocated assets and liabilities that comprise corporate items that are not specifically attributable to one segment.
Reconciliation of these assets and liabilities to total assets or liabilities in the balance sheet is shown below: 2010 2011 restated m m Inventories for reportable segments 891 726 Unallocated: Elimination of profit on inter-company inventory 133 83 Total inventories per the balance sheet 758 643 Trade and other receivables for reportable segments 1,392 1,337 Unallocated: Corporate items 50 5 Total trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 1,442 1,342 Total inventories and trade and other receivables per the balance sheet 2,200 1,985 Other unallocated assets 11,926 11,437 Total assets per the balance sheet 14,126 13,422 Trade and other payables for reportable segments 2,741 2,474 Unallocated: Corporate items 160 150 Total trade and other payables per the balance sheet 2,901 2,624 Other unallocated liabilities 5,444 5,668 Total liabilities per the balance sheet 8,345 8,292 Restated for the fair value adjustments disclosed in note 29.
Unallocated assets include goodwill and intangible assets, property plant and equipment and cash and cash equivalents, while unallocated liabilities include borrowings, deferred tax liabilities and retirement benefit obligations.
46 2011 2 OPERATING SEGMENTS CONTINUED Analysis of Product Groups The Group analyses its revenue by the following product groups: health & personal care, fabric care, surface care, home care, dishwashing and other, together with Pharmaceuticals and food.
Net revenues 2010 2011 restated m m Health & personal care 3,156 2,318 Fabric care 1,503 1,576 Surface care 1,422 1,391 Home care 1,204 1,152 Dishwashing 896 875 Other 227 100 Household and health & personal care 8,408 7,412 Pharmaceuticals 762 737 Food 315 304 Total 9,485 8,453 Restated for the re-allocation of SSL revenue to product groups.
The majority of the categories above are split across the three geographical segments being Europe, NAA and Developing Markets.
The notable exceptions to this are: Food, which is sold predominantly in NAA: and Pharmaceuticals which is within its own reportable segment.
The Company is domiciled in the UK.
The split of revenue from external customers and non-current assets other than financial instruments, deferred tax assets and retirement benefit surplus assets between the UK, the US being the single biggest country outside the Country of Domicile and that from all other countries is: All other UK US countries Total 2011 m m m m Net revenue 685 2,304 6,496 9,485 Goodwill and other intangible assets 1,536 3,252 5,470 10,258 Property, plant and equipment 133 131 468 732 Other receivables 6 6 All other UK US countries Total 2010 m m m m Net revenue 621 2,344 5,488 8,453 Goodwill and other intangible assets restated 1,536 3,245 5,084 9,865 Property, plant and equipment restated 138 133 464 735 Other receivables 3 3 Restated for the fair value adjustments disclosed in note 29.
The net revenue from external customers reported on a geographical basis above is measured in a manner consistent with that in the reportable segments.
Major customers are typically large grocery chains, mass market and multiple retailers.
The Groups customer base is diverse with no single external customer accounting for more than 10% of net revenue, and the top ten customers accounting for less than a quarter of total net revenue.

Accordingly, the Companys profits for the year ended 31 December 2011 are taxed at an effective rate of 26.5%.
UK income tax of 161m 2010: 151m is included within current tax and is calculated at 26.5% 2010: 28% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the relevant jurisdictions.
The total tax charge for the year can be reconciled to the accounting profit as follows: 2011 2010 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 2,376 2,136 Tax at the UK corporation tax rate of 26.5% 2010: 28% 630 598 Effects of: Tax at rates other than the UK corporation tax rate 9 9 Adjustments to amounts carried in respect of unresolved tax matters 47 16 Utilised tax losses 2 9 Withholdings and local taxes 25 26 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 11 65 Effect of change in UK corporation tax rate 65 13 Exceptional items 2 18 Other permanent differences 5 4 Total tax charge 622 566 The tax charge is expected to be impacted by items in the nature of those listed above for the foreseeable future.
Following the enactment of legislation in the UK to reduce the corporation tax rate to 26% from 1 April 2011 and to 25% from 1 April 2012, the total tax charge in 2011 includes the impact on the income statement of calculating the UK deferred tax balances at the lower UK corporation tax rates.
The impact of this rate change is a 65m reduction in the tax charge in the income statement and a 2m increase in the tax charge in other comprehensive income.
The proposed future reduction in the UK tax rate to 23% will be reflected when the relevant legislation is substantively enacted.

Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of potentially dilutive ordinary shares: Executive Share Options and Employee Sharesave schemes.
As at 31 December 2011, there were 4m 2010: 4m of Executive Share Options not included within the dilution because the exercise price for the options was greater than the average share price for the year.

The amount stated for brands represents the fair value at the date of acquisition of brands since 1985.
Other includes product registration, distribution rights and capitalised product development costs.
The majority of brands, all of goodwill and certain other intangibles are considered to have indefinite lives for the reasons noted in the Accounting Policies and accordingly are subject to an annual impairment review.
A number of small non-core brands are deemed to have a finite life and are amortised accordingly.
The reclassification of 6m 2010: nil shows the transfer of completed assets from plant and equipment.

Intangible assets are allocated to a cash generating unit CGU for the purposes of impairment testing.
The annual impairment review for goodwill and other intangible assets is based on an assessment of each CGUs value in use.
Value in use is calculated from cash flow projections based on historical operating results, short-term budgets, medium-term business plans three years and longer-term extrapolation.
The long-term extrapolations assume a growth rate of no more than the long-term inflation assumption for the relevant markets range of 1%2% 2010: 1%3%.
A pre-tax discount rate of 11% 2010: 11% has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Key assumptions which are kept under constant review by management in the impairment review include future sales volumes, growth rates and prices, and future levels of marketing support required to sustain, grow and further innovate brands.
These key assumptions are based on past performance and our experience of volumes, growth rates and prices in our key markets.
The value in use of the health & personal care CGU is the most sensitive to reasonably possible changes to key assumptions in the value in use calculation.
However the following individual reasonably possible changes in assumptions all else being equal would not cause the health & personal care CGUs recoverable amount to be less than its carrying value: Pre-tax discount rate - 2% Short-term growth expectations - 10% Long-term growth assumption - 2%.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset where they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
Certain deferred tax assets totalling 115m 2010: 227m in respect of overseas corporation tax losses and other temporary differences have not been recognised at 31 December 2011 as the likelihood of future economic benefit is not sufficiently assured.
These assets will be recognised if utilisation of the losses and other temporary differences becomes reasonably certain.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.
12 AVAILABLE FOR SALE FINANCIAL ASSETS Current These investments of 11m 2010: 11m do not meet the requirements to be classified as cash equivalents as they have maturities greater than three months.
They are however highly liquid assets, consisting solely of short-term deposits.
All of these deposits are held with financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The effective interest rate on these short-term deposits is 8.56% 2010: 7.36% and they have an average maturity of 227 days 2010: 164 days from inception.
Non-current These investments are auction rate securities issued by US state authorities, denominated in US dollars with redemption dates falling beyond 2012.
They are typically traded on a secondary market, however due to the current inactivity of this market there is uncertainty over whether they are likely to be redeemed within one year and therefore have been classified as non-current.
Although these investments are not directly guaranteed by the US Federal Government, the underlying assets are.
None of these investments are past due or impaired.
The market for auction rate securities is inactive and therefore management has adopted a discounted cash flow valuation technique to determine a fair value of the securities.
The movement in the fair value of auction rate securities is detailed below: 2011 2010 m m At 1 January 12 16 Disposals 2 5 Exchange adjustments 1 At 31 December 10 12 13 INVENTORIES 2010 2011 restated m m Raw materials and consumables 167 150 Work in progress 31 25 Finished goods and goods held for resale 560 468 Total inventories 758 643 See note 29 for further details.

The credit risk of customers is assessed at a subsidiary and Group level, taking into account their financial positions, past experiences and other relevant factors.
Individual customer credit limits are imposed based on these factors.
As of 31 December 2011, trade receivables of 89m 2010: 86m were past due but not impaired.
The ageing analysis of trade receivables past due but not impaired is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Up to 3 months 89 86 As at 31 December 2011, trade receivables of 80m 2010: 67m were considered to be impaired.
The amount of provision on 31 December 2011 was 47m 2010: 41m.
It was assessed that a portion of the receivables is expected to be recovered due to the nature and historical collection of trade receivables.
The ageing analysis of these receivables is as follows: 2011 2010 m m Up to 3 months 40 35 Over 3 months 40 32 80 67 The movement in the provision for impaired receivables consists of increases for additional provisions offset by receivables written off and unused provision released back to the income statement.
The gross movements in the provision are considered to be insignificant.
The credit quality of trade receivables that are neither past due nor impaired is assessed by reference to external credit ratings where available.
Where no external credit rating is available, historical information about counterparty default rates is used.
The other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
They consist of items including reclaimable turnover tax and are from a broad selection of countries within the Group.

1 Prepayments and accrued income and employee benefit assets are excluded from the trade and other receivables balance as the analysis above is required only for financial instruments.
2 The categories in this disclosure are determined by IAS 39.
Finance leases are outside the scope of IAS 39, but they remain within the scope of IFRS 7.
Therefore finance leases have been shown separately.
3 Social security liabilities and employee benefit liabilities are excluded from the trade and other payable balance as the analysis above is required only for financial instruments.
The carrying value less impairment provision of investments, current borrowings, cash at bank, trade receivables and trade payables are assumed to approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value measurement hierarchy levels have been defined as follows: 1 Quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level 1.
2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly that is, as prices or indirectly that is, derived from prices level 2.
If all significant inputs required to fair value an instrument are observable, the instrument is included in level 2.
3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data that is, unobservable inputs level 3.

Financial risk management The Groups multi-national operations expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates foreign exchange risk, market prices, interest rates, credit risks and liquidity.
The Group has in place a risk management programme that uses foreign currency financial instruments, including debt, and other instruments, to limit the impact of these risks on the financial performance of the Group.
The Groups financing and financial risk management activities are centralised into Group Treasury GT to achieve benefits of scale and control.
GT manages financial exposures of the Group centrally in a manner consistent with underlying business risks.
GT manages only those risks and flows generated by the underlying commercial operations and speculative transactions are not undertaken.
The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies, guidelines and authority levels for all areas of treasury activity and individually approves significant activities.
GT operates under the close control of the Chief Financial Officer and is subject to periodic independent reviews and audits, both internal and external.
Market risk a Foreign exchange risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to align interest costs and operating profit of its major currencies in order to provide some protection against the translation exposure on foreign currency profits after tax.
The Group may undertake borrowings and other hedging methods in the currencies of the countries where most of its assets are located.
It is the Groups policy to monitor and only where appropriate hedge its foreign currency transaction exposure.
These transaction exposures arise mainly from foreign currency receipts and payments for goods and services and from the remittances of foreign currency dividends and loans.
The local business units enter into forward foreign exchange contracts with GT to manage these exposures where practical and allowed by local regulations.
GT matches the Group exposures, and hedges the net position where possible, using spot and forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2011 was 3,175m payable 2010: 3,230m payable.
2011 59 Notes to the financial statements continued 15 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED Cash flow hedge profile As at 31 December 2011, the Group had no material individual financial instruments classified as cash flow hedges.
The same was true as at 31 December 2010.
The Group held forward foreign exchange contracts denominated as cash flow hedges primarily in Polish zloty, Australian dollars, Canadian dollars, and US dollars.
Notional value of the payable leg resulting from these financial instruments was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Polish zloty 53 4 Australian dollars 47 42 Canadian dollars 40 45 US dollars 14 Swedish krona 13 12 Euro 12 96 New Zealand dollars 11 10 Other 4 130 194 339 These forward foreign exchange contracts are expected to mature evenly over the period January 2012 to December 2012 2010: January 2011 to January 2012.
There is no ineffective portion recognised in the income statement arising from cash flow hedges 2010: nil.
Gains and losses recognised in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income on forward exchange contracts in 2011 of 3m gain 2010: 2m loss are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
In the case of cash flow hedges, these are denominated in a diverse range of currencies, where a fluctuation in one individual currency relationship with all others held constant does not have a significant effect on the income statement or shareholders equity.
A fluctuation analysis has been performed for all currencies.
The largest potential fluctuation would be in respect of forward contracts between the Euro and Polish zloty.
If the Polish zloty had strengthened weakened by 5% against the Euro, with all other variables held constant, the impact on shareholders equity would have been less than 1m 2010: 5%: nil.
As at 31 December 2011 if all other currencies had strengthened weakened by 5% against sterling with all other variables held constant, this would have had an insignificant effect on the income statement or shareholders equity 2010: insignificant.
The remaining major monetary financial instruments liquid assets, receivables, interest and non interest-bearing liabilities are directly denominated in the functional currency or are transferred to the functional currency through the use of derivatives.
The gains and losses from fair value movements on financing derivatives recognised in finance income and expense were nil 2010: nil.
b Price risk Due to the nature of its business the Group is exposed to commodity price risk related to the production or packaging of finished goods using oil-related and a diverse range of other raw materials.
This risk is, however, managed primarily through medium-term contracts with certain key suppliers and is not therefore viewed as being a material risk.
c Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The Group has both interest-bearing and non interest-bearing liabilities.
The Group manages its interest expense rate exposure using a mixture of fixed rate and floating rate debt.
The Group manages its interest income rate exposure on its gross financial assets by using a combination of fixed rate term deposits.
The Group analyses its interest rate exposure on a regular basis.
Various scenarios are simulated taking into consideration refinancing, renewal of existing positions, alternative financing and hedging.
Based on these scenarios, the Group calculates the impact on the income statement of a defined interest rate shift.
For each simulation, the same interest rate shift is used for all currencies, calculated on a full year and pre-tax basis.
The scenarios are only run for liabilities that represent the major interest-bearing positions.
Based on the simulations performed, the impact on the income statement of a 50 bps shift in interest rates would be a maximum increase of 10m 2010: 50 bps: 1m or decrease of 10m 2010: 50 bps: 1m, respectively for the liabilities covered.
The simulation is done on a periodic basis to verify that the maximum loss potential is within the limit given by management.
2. Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers.
The credit quality of trade and other receivables is detailed in note 14.
Financial institution counterparties are subject to approval under the Groups counterparty risk policy and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a BBB rating or above.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit defined within the counterparty risk policy, which is reassessed annually by the Board of Directors.
Derivative financial instruments are only traded with counterparties approved in accordance with the Board approved policy.
Derivative risk is measured using a risk weighting method.
60 2011 15 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The table below summarises the Groups major financial institution counterparties by credit rating lower of S&P and Moodys and balances cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments, deposits at the balance sheet date.
Liquidity risk Cash flow forecasting is performed by the local business units and aggregated by GT.
GT monitors rolling forecasts of the Groups liquidity requirements to ensure it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs while maintaining sufficient headroom on its undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Funds over and above those required for short-term working capital purposes by the overseas businesses are generally remitted to GT.
The Group uses the remittances to settle obligations, repay borrowings, or, in the event of a surplus, invest in short-term instruments issued by institutions with a BBB rating or better.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The Group has bilateral credit facilities with high-quality international banks.
All of these facilities have similar or equivalent terms and conditions, and have a financial covenant, which is not expected to restrict the Groups future operations.
At the end of 2011, the Group had, in addition to its long-term debt of 3m 2010: 3m, committed borrowing facilities totalling 3,600m 2010: 3,400m, of which 3,600m exceeded 12 months maturity.
Of the total facilities at the year end, nil 2010: 400m was utilised.
The committed borrowing facilities, together with available uncommitted facilities and central cash and investments, are considered sufficient to meet the Groups projected cash requirements.
The undrawn committed facilities available, in respect of which all conditions precedent have been met at the balance sheet date, were as follows: 2011 2010 m m Undrawn committed borrowing facilities: Expiring within one year Expiring between one and two years 850 1,725 Expiring after more than two years 2,750 1,275 3,600 3,000 All borrowing facilities are at floating rates of interest.
The facilities have been arranged to cover general corporate purposes including support for commercial paper issuance.
All facilities incur commitment fees at market rates.
Headroom between net debt and available facilities at 31 December 2011 was 1,805m 2010: 1,389m.
The Groups borrowing limit at 31 December 2011, calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association, was 59,823m 2010: 57,861m.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities and the derivatives which will be settled on a net basis into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

Capital management The Group considers capital to be net debt plus total equity.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents, short-term available for sale financial assets and financing derivative financial instruments refer note 17.
Total equity includes share capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
2011 2010 m m Net debt note 17 1,795 2,011 Total equity 5,781 5,130 7,576 7,141 The Groups objectives for managing capital are to safeguard the Groups and Companys ability to continue as a going concern, in order to provide returns for Shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an efficient capital structure to optimise the cost of capital.
In maintaining an appropriate capital structure and providing returns for Shareholders, in 2011 the Company provided returns to Shareholders in the form of dividends, current details of which are included in the Financial Review for the year on page 16.
The Group monitors net debt and at year end the Group had net debt of 1,795m 2010: net debt of 2,011m.
The Group does not actively monitor a gearing ratio, but seeks to pay down net debt using cash generated by the business to maintain an appropriate level of financial flexibility.

20 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Contingent liabilities for the Group, comprising guarantees relating to subsidiary undertakings, at 31 December 2011 amounted to 4m 2010: 21m.
The Group is involved in a number of investigations by government authorities and has made provisions for such investigations, where appropriate.
Where it is too early to determine the likely outcome of these matters, the Directors have made no provision for such potential liabilities.
During 2011, the Group agreed to pay a 24m fine in the settlement of an investigation by the German Federal Cartel Office involving price fixing agreements between 2005 and 2008.
The Group has received a civil claim for damages from the Department of Health and others in the United Kingdom regarding alleged anti-competitive activity involving the Gaviscon brand.
The claim is under review and, although it is at an early stage, the Directors do not believe that any potential impact would be material to the Group financial statements.
The Group from time to time is involved in disputes in relation to ongoing tax matters in a number of jurisdictions around the world.
Where appropriate, the Directors make provisions based on their assessment of each case.

22 PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT COMMITMENTS The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees, which are principally funded.
The Groups most significant defined benefit pension schemes UK is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The Group also operates a number of other post-retirement schemes in certain countries.
The major scheme is in the US US Retiree Health Care Scheme, where salaried participants become eligible for retiree health care benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
As at 31 December 2011 there were 2,584 2010: 2,597 eligible retirees and 1,312 2010: 1,552 current employees potentially eligible.
Pension costs for the year are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Defined contribution schemes 26 27 Defined benefit schemes net charge 25 29 Total pension costs recognised in the income statement note 3 51 56 64 2011 22 PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT COMMITMENTS CONTINUED For the largest UK scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 5 April 2010 and updated at 31 December 2011.
For the US scheme, a full independent actuarial valuation was carried out at 1 January 2011 and updated at 31 December 2011.
The projected unit valuation method was used for the UK and US scheme valuations.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries for the two major schemes as at 31 December 2011 were: 2011 2010 US US UK medical UK medical % % % % Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.6 4.6 Rate of increase in deferred pensions during deferment 3.1 3.6 Rate of increase in pension payments pensioners 3.1 3.6 Rate of increase in pension payments non-pensioners 3.1 3.6 Discount rate 4.8 4.7 5.4 5.5 Inflation assumption 3.1 3.6 Annual medical cost inflation 5.0-90 5.0-9.0 Long-term expected rate of return on: Equities 8.1 8.1 Bonds 4.8 4.7 Other 6.6 6.5 The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on market expectation at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligation.
Assumptions regarding future mortality experience are set in accordance with published statistics and experience in each territory.
For the UK scheme the mortality assumptions were based on the following tables: the average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60 on the balance sheet date is as follows: 2011 2010 years years Male 28.0 28.0 Female 29.8 29.8 The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at aged 60, 15 years after the balance sheet date, is as follows: 2011 2010 years years Male 29.8 29.8 Female 31.7 31.8 For the US scheme the mortality assumptions were determined using the RP2000 combined table.
The average life expectancy in years of a pensioner retiring at age 60 on the balance sheet date is 24.0 years 2010: 23.9 years for males and 25.8 years 2010: 25.7 years for females.

Individual tranches of these other share awards are not material for detailed disclosure and therefore have been aggregated in the tables below.
All outstanding Executive and Other share awards as at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are included in the tables below which analyse the charge for 2011 and 2010.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Options outstanding at 31 December 2011 that could have been exercised at that date were 5,617,828 2010: 3,308,805.
Notes The assumptions made within the valuation calculation with respect to the achievement of performance criteria are based on the Directors expectations in light of the Groups business model and relevant published targets.
Under the terms of the Plans, early exercise is not permitted and therefore the effect of early exercise is not incorporated into the calculation.
The calculation also assumes that there will be no leavers in the following year.
No material modifications have been made to the Plans in 2011 or 2010 for the purposes of the valuation.
Volatility: An estimate of future volatility is made with reference to historical volatility over a similar time period to the performance period or the contractual life as appropriate.
Historical volatility is calculated based on the annualised standard deviation of the Groups daily share price movement, being an approximation to the continuously compounded rate of return on the share.
Income statement charge: The income statement charge may not exactly equal one-third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in-year lapses or award revisions.
National Insurance contributions are payable in respect of certain share based payments transactions and are treated as cash-settled transactions.
Any additional terms of these shares are shown in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 35.
The weighted average share price for the year was 33.07 2010: 33.75.
