Financial assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the UK Defined Benefit Pension Scheme was carried out at 31 March 2009 and showed a deficit of 1.3bn.
A funding plan of 800m was agreed with the Trustees.
The difference between the valuation and the funding plan is expected to be met by investment returns on the existing assets of the pension scheme.
The financial assumptions for the UK scheme and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes have been updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes: 2011 2010 % % Rate of increase in salaries 1.0 1.0 Rate of increase in pensions in payment for service pre-April 1997 2.8 2.7 between April 1997 and July 2005 3.4 3.5 post-July 2005 2.4 2.3 Discount rate 5.5 5.5 Inflation rate 3.4 3.6 Long-term healthcare cost increases 7.4 8.6 The inflation rate of 3.4% reflects the Retail Price Index RPI rate.
In line with changes to legislation certain benefits have been calculated with reference to the Consumer Price Index CPI as the inflationary measure and in these instances a rate of 2.7% has been used.
The change from RPI to CPI for deferred revaluation has been included in these results, resulting in a gain of approximately 170m, taken as an actuarial gain on the obligation.
The amount of the surplus varies if the main financial assumptions change, particularly the discount rate.
If the discount rate increased decreased by 0.1% the IAS 19 surplus would increase decrease by c. 90m last year 90m.
If the inflation rate increased by 0.1%, the IAS 19 surplus would decrease by c. 55m and if the inflation rate decreased by 0.1%, the IAS 19 surplus would increase by c. 45m.
C. Demographic assumptions The demographic assumptions are in line with those adopted for the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme 31 March 2009.
One of the most significant demographic assumptions underlying the valuation is mortality.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on an analysis of the pensioner mortality trends under the scheme for the period to March 2009 updated to allow for anticipated longevity improvements over the subsequent years.
The specific mortality rates used are based on the SAPS tables, adjusted to allow for the experience of scheme pensioners.
The life expectancies underlying the valuation are as follows: 2011 2010 years years Current pensioners at age 65 males 22.0 21.9 females 23.4 23.3 Future pensioners at age 65 males 23.2 23.1 females 24.3 24.2 Marks and Spencer Group plc Annual report and financial statements 2011 Financial statements Strategy Performance & Marketplace Operating review Financial review Governance & other information 89 11 Retirement benefits continued D.
