Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 99 Notes to the accounts 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS AND RESULTS PRESENTATION BG Groups reportable segments are those used by the Groups Board and management the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined in IFRS 8 Operating Segments to run the business and are based on differences in the Groups products and services.
Segment information is presented onthe same basis as that used for internal reporting purposes.
BG Groups three principal operating and reporting segments in 2011 comprise Exploration and Production E&P, Liquefied Natural Gas LNG and Transmission and Distribution T&D.
E&P comprises exploration, development, production and marketing of hydrocarbons with a focus on natural gas.
LNG combines the development and use of LNG import and export facilities with the purchase, shipping and sale of LNG and regasified natural gas.
T&D develops, owns and operates major pipelines, distribution networks and power stations, and supplies natural gas and electricity through these to the end customer.
Other activities primarily comprise costs relating tobusiness development expenditure and certain corporate activities.
In 2011, the operations were structured in four main geographical areas: Europe and Central Asia region: Africa, Middle East and Asia region: Americas and Global LNG region: and Australia region.
From 1 January 2012, the Group is managed across three regions: Americas and Europe: Africa, Central and South Asia: and Australia and East Asia, supported by Global Energy Marketing and Shipping GEMS and BG Advance.
Intra-Group and inter-segment sales are settled at market prices and are generally based on the same prices as those charged to third parties armslength principle.
Group revenue, profit for the year, non-current assets, net assets, gross assets and gross liabilities, depreciation and amortisation and capital investment attributable to BG Group activities are shown on pages 99 to 102, analysed by operating segment.
Additional information on capital investment is also provided on a regional basis.
The presentation of BG Groups results under IFRS separately identifies the effect of the re-measurement ofcertain financial instruments, profits and losses on the disposal and impairment of non-current assets and certain restructuring costs when material.
Results excluding discontinued operations and disposals, certain re-measurements, certain restructuring costs and impairments Business performance are used bymanagement and are presented in order to provide readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the underlying operating performance ofthe Groups ongoing business.
Further information on Business performance is given on page 148.
The disposals, re-measurements and impairments column includes unrealised gains and losses in respect of certain long-term gas sales contracts classified as derivatives under IAS 39, commodity instruments that represent economic hedges but do not qualify for hedge accounting, and financial instruments used to manage foreign exchange and interest rate exposure.
Where these financial instruments represent economic hedges butcannot be designated as hedges under IAS 39, foreign exchange movements associated with the underlying borrowings are also included.
Theseparate presentation of these items best reflects the underlying performance of the business since it distinguishes between the temporary timing differences associated with re-measurements under IAS 39 rules and actual realised gains and losses.
Under IFRS the results from jointly controlled entities joint ventures and associates are presented net of tax and finance costs on the face of theincome statement.
BG Group also presents the operating profit of the Group including results of joint ventures and associates before interest andtax, as this approach provides additional information on the source of the Groups operating profits.
The following tables provide a reconciliation between the overall results and Business performance and operating profit, including and excluding the results of joint ventures and associates.
The geographical information provided for external revenue is based on destination.
External revenue attributable to non-UK countries is $16 968m 2010 $13 393m and includes $2 746m attributable to Brazil representing 13% of Group revenue 2010 $2 791m, 16% and $2 089m attributable toJapan representing 10%of Group revenue 2010 $905m, 5%.
b External revenue in respect of a single external customer amounted to $3 267m in 2011, recognised in the E&P segment.

Awards are in the form of shares 2011 1.6m shares: 2010 1.3m shares or nil-cost options 2011 1.8m options: 2010 2.0m options.
The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the shares and options at the award date.
Dividend equivalents accrue on the award during the vesting period.
Accordingly, the fair value of the shares and options awarded is based on the market value of the shares on the award date, which was 12.79 per share in 2011 2010 10.66 per share.
Performance Share Awards Details of Performance Share Awards under the Groups LTIP are given on page 73.
Awards are in the form of shares 2011 0.5m shares: 2010 0.6m shares or nil-cost options 2011 2.6m options: 2010 2.7m options.
The costs in respect of these awards are charged to the income statement over the vesting period, based on the fair value of the shares and options at the award date, adjusted for the probability of market-related performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year in respect of Performance Share Awards is estimated using a Monte Carlo projection model with the following assumptions: weighted average share price of 12.76 2010 10.63, exercise price of nil 2010 nil, a risk-free rate of 0.41% 2010 0.9% and a vesting period of three years 2010 three years.
The model also contains assumptions for both the Group and each member of the industry peer group set out on page 73 in respect of volatility, average share price growth and share price correlation.
Expected volatility was determined bycalculating the historical volatility of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Share price correlation was determined by calculating the historical correlation of the share price over the previous three-year period.
Average share price growth was determined from historical growth overthe previous year.
The fair value reflects the probability of market performance conditions being achieved.
The fair value of shares and options awarded during the year was 7.12 per share 2010 5.97 per share.
Other Share Awards The charge for Other share awards includes awards made under the Deferred Bonus Plan: the Sharesave Plan: the Share Incentive Plan: and for 2010only, the Long-Term Incentive Scheme LTIS.
The Deferred Bonus Plan operates in conjunction with the Annual Incentive Scheme AIS and is described on page 72.
In 2011, awards of 0.2m shareswere made under this plan 2010 0.1m shares.
The charge to the income statement in respect of these awards was $5m in 2011 2010 $2m and is based on the market value of the shares at the award date, which was 14.99 in 2011 2010 11.76.
Details of the Sharesave Plan are given on page 74.
The charge to the income statement in respect of this Plan is based on the fair value of the shareoptions at the grant date and the likelihood of allocations vesting under the scheme.
The fair value ofthe share options granted is determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model and was 3.90 in 2011 2010 4.13.
Details of the Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 74.
In 2011, awards of 0.2m shares 2010 0.5m shares were made in conjunction with theGroups UK Flexible Benefits Plan.

In 2010 there was a charge of $5m in respect of the LTIS.
No allocations have been made under this scheme since 2007. www.
com Business review Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information 107 3 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES continued E SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued Cash-Settled Share-Based Payments Cash-settled share-based payments arise when the Group incurs a liability to transfer cash amounts that are based on the price or value of the Companys shares.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that it might be impaired.
As at 31 December 2011, $726m of the goodwill recognised related to Companhia fide Gs fide So Paulo Comgs 2010 $817m, which is classified within the T&D segment.
Comgsisdefined as a CGU for impairment testing purposes.
No goodwill impairment has been recognised in respect ofthis CGU.
The recoverable amount of the Comgs CGU is determined from fair value less costs to sell calculations, using cash flow projections over the concession period.
The projected cash flows are adjusted for associated risks and the likelihood of the concession period being extended, and are discounted using a nominal rateof 8% post-tax.
The volume growth rate assumptions used in the projections were based on past performance andmanagements expectations ofmarket development.
The annual volume growth rates used to determine long term cash flows are between 3.9% and 4.3% and do not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
Contractual rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, usually five years, and relate to the cost incurredin connecting consumers to the Comgs natural gas distribution system.
Other also includes the contractual rights in respect of the purchase of LNG, regasification services and related gassales at ElbaIsland in the USA: these rights are amortised on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and have an average remaining life of nine years 2010 10 years.

c Disposals and unsuccessful exploration expenditure includes $293m 2010 $382m in respect of unsuccessful exploration expenditure written off.
Comgs operates under a concession arrangement with the local Regulator ARSESP to distribute gas to a number of different market segments inthe state of So Paulo, Brazil.
The Comgs concession is a 30-year franchise, with a potential to extend for a further 20 years when the primary concession period ends in 2029.
The arrangements between Comgs and the local Regulator are classified as a service concession arrangement inaccordance with IFRIC 12.
The Regulator reviews the maximum margin that can be charged to each market segment every five years.
Changes to the tariff primarily reflect theeconomic balance between investments, operating expenses, cost of capital, inflation, efficiency and changes in the cost of gas purchased by Comgs.
At least once a year, the Regulator adjusts the tariff for inflation and gas cost variances.
The current tariff structure covering the period 2009 to 2014 was agreed with the Regulator in 2009.
There were no significant changes to the concession arrangement in 2011.
Under the terms of each tariff review, Comgs commits to a certain level of expenditure necessary to develop and maintain the gas distribution network within the concession area.
Comgs is required to use the network infrastructure to supply gas to industrial, commercial, residential, natural gas vehicle, cogeneration and power customers.
At the end of the concession period, ownership of the infrastructure passes to the Regulator in exchange for consideration based on the residual value.
In accordance with IFRIC 12, all infrastructure associated with the service concession arrangement is recognised as an intangible concession asset with additions to the infrastructure being accounted for as a construction contract with the Regulator.
During the year, additions to infrastructure of $192m 2010 $148m were recognised as revenue.
No profit or loss has been recognised in respect of additions to infrastructure in 2011 or 2010. www.

During 2010, BG Group committed to a plan to dispose of its indirect 40% interests in First Gas Holdings Corporation and FGP Corp which own theSanta Rita and San Lorenzo power stations in the Philippines, respectively.
Accordingly, these businesses were reclassified as held for sale asat31 December 2010.
In April 2011, the sale and purchase agreement for the sale of BG Groups 40% interests in both the Santa Rita and San Lorenzo power stations was terminated as certain consents and waivers from third parties were not received.
BG Group continues to consider the ultimate disposal ofthe SantaRita and San Lorenzo power stations as highly probable.
As such, BG Groups holding in these assets will continue to be classified asheld forsale.
Other intangible assets have been classified as held for sale as they are subject to a sale and purchase agreement that was signed in 2011.

As part of its business operations, the Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in order to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rates.
The Group enters intointerest rate derivatives to manage the composition of floating and fixed rate debt.
The Group enters into currency derivatives to hedge certainforeign currency cash flows and to adjust the currency composition of its assets and liabilities.
Certain agreements are combined foreign currency and interest swap transactions, described as cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The Groups policy is to enter into interest or exchange ratederivatives only where these are matched by an underlying asset, liability or transaction.
Further information on treasury risks is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 46 to 51.
COMMODITY INSTRUMENTS Within the ordinary course of business the Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions for commodities.
The majority of thesetransactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and continue to be held for the purpose of the receipt or delivery of the commodityin accordance with the Groups expected sale, purchase or usage requirements.
Such contracts are not within the scope of IAS 39.
Certain gas sales contracts fall within the scope of IAS 39.
These contracts include pricing terms that are based on a variety of commodities andindices.
They are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Certain short-term market traded contracts for the purchase and subsequent resale of third-party commodities are within the scope of IAS 39 andare recognised in the balance sheet at fair value with movements in fair value recognised in the income statement.
The Group uses various commodity based derivative instruments to manage some of the risks arising from fluctuations in commodity prices.
Such contracts include physical and net-settled forwards, futures, swaps and options.
Where these derivatives have been designated as cash flow hedges of underlying commodity price exposures, certain gains and losses attributable to these instruments are deferred in other comprehensive income and subsequently recognised in the income statement when the underlying hedged transaction crystallises.
Commodity derivatives that are not partofa hedging relationship are recognised in the balance sheet within Other commodity derivatives at fair value, with movements in fair valuerecognised in the income statement.
Further information on commodity price exposure is contained in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 46 to 51.

These notional principal amounts give an indication of the scale of derivatives held, but do not reflect the risks that theGroup is exposed to from their use.
VALUATION All financial instruments that are initially recognised and subsequently re-measured at fair value have been classified in accordance with the hierarchy described in IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
Fair value measurement hierarchy The fair value hierarchy, described below, reflects the significance of the inputs used to determine the valuation of financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived directly from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.
Level 2 fair value measurements are those including inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability directly or indirectly.
The fair value of the Groups interest rate and currency exchange rate derivatives and the majority of the Groups commodity derivatives are calculated from relevant market prices and yield curves at the balance sheet date and are therefore based solely on observable price information.
These instruments are not directly quoted in active markets and are accordingly classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.
Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include significant inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Where observable market valuations of commodity contracts are unavailable, the fair value on initial recognition is the transaction price and is subsequently determined using the Groups forward planning assumptions for the price of gas, other commodities and indices.
Due to the assumptions underlying their fair value, certain gas contracts are categorised as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy.
One of the assumptions used for their valuation isthat observable commodity prices are liquid for four years 2010 four years.
As at 31 December 2011, the average four-year forward price for UK gaswas 62p per therm 2010 61p per therm.
Beyond this period a seasonally adjusted UK gas price of 66p per therm 2010 45p per therm has been used, along with a $103 per barrel 2010 $77 per barrel Brent oil price and an electricity price of 55 per megawatt hour 2010 45 per megawatt hour, subject to annual inflation of 3.0% 2010 2.0%.
The fair values of the long-term commodity contracts are then calculated using the market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
As at 31 December 2011, the potential change in the fair value of gas contracts, assuming changes in the price assumptions of gas 15p per therm, Brent $10 per barrel and electricity 15 per megawatt hour, was $19m 2010 $4m.

Further information can be found in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 46 to 51.
Fair value hedges As at 31 December 2011, the Group held a number of interest rate swaps and cross-currency interest rate swaps designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with the Groups fixed rate debt.
The Group also held a number of commodity derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value risk associated with fixed price firm sales commitments.
The hedged items and the related derivatives have the same critical terms to ensure that they are an effective hedge under IAS 39.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges outstanding as at 31 December 2011 is$128m 2010 $ 27 m. During 2011, adjustments of $ 290 m 2010 $20m have been made to hedged items in respect of the risks being hedged.
Cash flow hedges The Group has forward commodity contracts, currency exchange rate derivatives and interest rate derivatives designated as hedges of highly probable forecast purchases and sales, and of interest flows and currency exposure on Group debt.
As at 31 December 2011, an unrealised pre-tax loss of $777m 2010 $564m was deferred in other comprehensive income in respect of effective cash flow hedges.
The hedged transactions are expected to occur within 26 years 2010 27 years and the associated gains and losses deferred in other comprehensive income will be released to the income statement as the underlying transaction crystallises.
As at 31 December 2011, deferred pre-tax losses of $605m 2010 $507m are expected to be released to the income statement within one year.
The fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges outstanding as at 31December 2011 is $ 801 m 2010 $ 798 m. During 2011, certain forecast commodity sales for which cash flow hedge accounting was used were nolonger expected to occur.
This resulted in the transfer of an unrealised pre-tax gain of $29m 2010 $42m from other comprehensive income tothe income statement.
Page 94 identifies the amounts that have been transferred from other comprehensive income in respect of transactions completed during the year.
These items are reported within the income statement or non-current assets to match against the underlying transaction.
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations As at 31 December 2011, certain borrowings and currency derivatives have been designated as hedges of the currency risk associated with net investments in foreign operations.
The portion of gains or losses on the hedging instruments determined to be an effective hedge are transferred to other comprehensive income to offset the gains or losses arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
The pre-tax loss on effective hedging instruments deferred within other comprehensive income as at 31 December 2011 is $296m 2010 $138m.
The fair value of financial instruments designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations outstanding as at 31 December 2011 is $ 4 838 m 2010 $ 1 924 m.

Periodic interest rate determinations in respect of floating rate loans to joint ventures and associates generally comprise London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR plus or minus an agreed margin.
As at 31 December 2011, floating rate receivables and loans to joint ventures and associates had an effective interest rate of between 0.84% and 4.12% 2010 between 0.97% and 3.29% and are expected to expire between 2012 and 2023 2010 between 2013 and 2020.
The maturity profile ofnon-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates cannot be practicably estimated as repayments are based on the performance of the individual joint venture or associate.

The fair values of fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans have been estimated based on quoted market prices where available, or by discounting all future cash flows by the relevant market yield curve at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associate loans approximate book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associates as repayment of these loans is linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associate and other considerations and itis therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
THE COMPANY The Companys financial instruments are all denominated in Pounds Sterling and consist of short-term receivables of $4 381m 2010 $3 883m, short-term payables of $55m 2010 $80m and cash and cash equivalents of $2m 2010 $1m.
Short-term receivables comprise amounts owed by Group undertakings, of which $4 376m 2010 $3 878m earns interest at LIBOR minus an agreed margin.
The remaining short-term receivables of $5m 2010 $5m were non-interest bearing.
Short-term payables are contractually payable within one year and are non-interest bearing.
The fair value of the financial instruments approximates book value.
FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The principal financial risks arising from financial instruments are commodity price risk, exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and credit and liquidity risk.
A description of these principal risks is outlined in the Principal risks and uncertainties section, pages 46 to 51.
Additional quantitative information and market sensitivities in relation to certain principal market risks are included in the following sections.
Liquidity risk The Group limits the amount of borrowings maturing within any specific period and the Groups financial assets are primarily held as short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
These measures keep liquidity risk low.

Credit risk in financial instruments arises from cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures of commercial counterparties including exposures in respect of outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
For banks and financial institutions, only independently rated parties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A are normally accepted as a counterparty and credit limits are established based primarily on the credit ratings, although other credit assessment factors that determine credit quality including the external environment are taken into account when considering the awarding of or maintenance of a limit.
Similarly if a commercial counterparty is independently credit rated, the rating is primarily used to determine credit quality and limits with other relevant assessment factors also considered.
If there is no independent credit rating, credit quality is assessed in accordance with credit policies which take account of the counterpartys financial position and other similar factors.
Exposures are monitored by the relevant Group businesses and at a Group level.
As at 31 December 2011, the Groups maximum credit risk exposure after the impact of any netting arrangements under interest rate related derivatives was $84m 2010 $104m, currency derivatives $66m 2010 $123m and commodity related derivatives $209m 2010 $292m.
The Groups credit risk exposure under receivables and other financial assets is represented by the book values.
The Group considers its portfolio forcredit related concentration risks where risks may result from strategic investments, commercial relationships or sales of product in a variety oflocations.
Mitigation may be considered where appropriate to diversify or reduce risk profile.
In this regard, the Groups domestic gas sales in Northern Africa havebeen reviewed and mitigation to reduce credit concentration and payment risk is ongoing, including re-financing arrangements to provide security over amounts outstanding.
com Financial statements 124 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the accounts continued 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market risk Financial instruments used by the Group that are affected by market risks primarily comprise cash and cash equivalents, borrowings and derivative contracts.

Thedeferred tax liability of $3 961m 2010 $3 134m is shown after the offset of certain deferred tax assets relating to the same fiscal authority: theliability prior to such offset is $7 610m 2010 $6 014m.
The net amount expected to be settled after more than 12 months is $3 943m 2010$3153m.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised, is approximately $5.0bn 2010 $4.4bn.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences either because no liability is expected to arise on distribution under applicable tax legislation or because the Group is in a position tocontrol the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
As at 31 December 2011, the Company had a deferred tax asset of $9m 2010 $12m.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences, unutilised tax losses and unused tax credits to the extent that realisation ofthe related tax benefit through future taxable income is probable.

E LEGAL PROCEEDINGS Italian criminal charges were brought in 2008 against certain current and former employees and consultants of BG Group in connection with allegations of improper conduct associated with the authorisation process for the planned Brindisi LNG S. p. A. Brindisi LNG regasification terminal.
BGItalia S. p. A. BG Italia, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Group, was also charged in relation to some of these allegations under Italian Legislative Decree No.
231 2001, an Italian anti-corruption statute which imposes liability on corporate entities under certain circumstances in the event certain criminal acts are committed by management or employees of the company.
Charges have also been brought against certain former directors of Brindisi LNG, a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Italia, who are alleged to have unlawfully permitted the occupation and alteration of public land, namely the port area in Brindisi where the regasification terminal is due to beconstructed, as a result of improperly authorised permits.
The charges in relation to this offence against some of these former directors were extinguished via an Oblazione granted by the Brindisi court.
This decision was overturned by the Supreme Court in February 2012 and the trial forthis offence will now be recommenced in the Brindisi court.
In addition, the Italian authorities may still be carrying out further investigations, the scope of which is unknown.
The trial in relation to the criminal charges commenced on 4 February 2009 and first instance judgement is expected in March 2012.
The Municipality of Brindisi, Province of Brindisi and Region of Puglia and three groups of environmentalists Italia Nostra, Legambiente and WorldWildlife Fund WWF Italia have separately commenced civil claims seeking damages against the accused individuals and against BG Italia.
Theseclaims have been brought within the framework of the criminal case and damages may be awarded in the event of guilty verdicts.
In October 2007, BG Group received formal notification from the Ministry of Economic Development that the original Article 8 authorisation fortheconstruction and operation of Brindisi LNG had been suspended pending the submission by BG Group of a full Environmental Impact Assessment EIA and confirmation from the Italian authorities as to the validity of the Article 8 authorisation.
BG Group challenged this suspension and that litigation is currently on hold.
On 15 January 2008, BG Group commenced the EIA approval process by submitting an EIA.
On 1 July 2010, a positive EIA Decree was issued, subject to certain conditions.
Several parties have challenged the EIA approval, including Brindisi LNG which is seeking to clarify some of the accompanying conditions.
There is now a process toreviseand revalidate the authorisation for the terminal.
There are various other ongoing legal proceedings relating to the Brindisi LNG regasification terminal, for example relating to consents necessary forthe construction work and environmental procedures.
The impact of these legal proceedings cannot yet be quantified but could delay or deny access to the Brindisi LNG terminal site.

This transaction isnot expected to have a material impact on the net assets of the Group.
It is not practicable at this time to estimate the financial effects, indicate the uncertainties relating to the amounts or timing of any economic inflows or outflows nor the possibility of any reimbursements in relation to the legal proceedings detailed above.
The Company and its subsidiaries are, or may from time to time be, in connection with current or past operations, involved in a number of legal orarbitration proceedings, including, for example, claims, suits, actions, investigations and or inquiries relating to commercial, tax, environmental orother matters, with third parties or governmental or regulatory authorities.

com Financial statements 130 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the accounts continued 26 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The majority of the Groups UK employees participate in the BG Pension Scheme BGPS, a defined benefit registered pension plan established undertrust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The BGPS is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions that, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the BGPSs assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable.
For the year ended 31 December 2011, the employers contribution rate in respect of most BGPS members was effectively 35.2% of pensionable pay excluding plan expenses which were met directly by the Company.
In addition, 3% of pensionable pay was contributed by most members either directly or by their employer via a salary sacrifice arrangement.
A full independent actuarial valuation of the BGPS for funding purposes as at 31 March 2011 is currently underway.
The previous actuarial valuation, asat 31 March 2008, showed that the aggregate market value of the plan assets at 31 March 2008 was 577m, representing some 83% of the accrued liabilities.
The Group made payments of 27m in 2009, 2010 and 2011 and intends to make three further payments of 27m in the years to 2014 inorder to reduce the plans deficit.
Based upon the contributions currently agreed between the Trustee and the Company following the 2008 actuarial valuation, aggregate Company contributions for the year ending 31 December 2012 including the 27m deficit reduction contribution areexpected to be 66m.
The BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme BGSBS provides benefits broadly in excess of the lifetime allowance.
This defined benefit plan is an unfunded, non-registered arrangement.
There is also an unfunded defined benefit post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare in respect ofemployees of Comgs.
With effect from 2 April 2007, new UK employees have been offered membership of a defined contribution stakeholder pension plan, the BG Group Retirement Benefits Plan BGRBP.
Life assurance and income protection benefits are also provided under separate plans: these benefits are fully insured.
Members may choose the rate at which they contribute to the BGRBP, either directly or via salary sacrifice, and the additional employers contribution is determined by the rate that the member selects.
A wide range of funds is available from which members may choose how the contributions will be invested.
The cost of the BGRBP and the related life assurance and income protection benefits has been included in the amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement.
The Group also has a number of smaller defined contribution and defined benefit plans which are not material in Group terms.
Valuations of plan assets and expected liabilities as at 31 December 2011 were carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with the requirements ofIAS 19.
In calculating the charge to the income statement including any recognised actuarial gains and losses, a 10% corridor was applied.
Thismeans that a portion of actuarial gains and losses is recognised as income or expense only if it exceeds the greater of: a 10% of the present value of the defined benefit obligation at that date before deducting plan assets : and b 10% of the fair value of any plan assets at that date.
These limits are calculated and applied separately for each defined benefit plan at each balance sheet date and the portion of actuarial gains andlosses to be recognised in future years for each plan is the excess of actuarial gains and losses over and above the 10% limits divided by the expected average remaining working lives of the employees participating in that plan.
The fair value of plan assets, the present value of plan liabilities and the net balance sheet liability were as follows: as at 31 December 2011 2010 $m $m Fair value of plan assets 1 289 1 290 Present value of liabilities 1 725 1 635 Deficit in plans 436 345 Unrecognised net loss 222 85 Net balance sheet liability 214 260 www.

The valuations as at 31 December were based on the following assumptions: 2011 2010 BGPS Comgs BGPS Comgs and healthcare and healthcare BGSBS plan BGSBS plan % % % % a Rate of price inflation and benefit increases 3.1 4.5 3.5 4.5 Future increases in earnings 4.1 n a 5.0 n a Discount rate 5.0 10.3 5.5 10.8 Healthcare cost trend rate n a 7.7 n a 10.0 a Rate of increase of deferred pensions and pensions in payment in excess of any Guaranteed Minimum Pension element.
The assumptions set out in the table above are those applicable to the currency in which the liabilities of each plan are denominated.
In the case ofthe BGPS and BGSBS this is Pounds Sterling and in the case of the Comgs healthcare plan this is Brazilian Reais.
If the discount rate used for the valuation of the BGPS and BGSBS was reduced by 0.1% to 4.9%, the defined benefit obligation would increase by$33m and the service cost for 2012 would increase by $2m.
In determining the defined benefit obligation as at 31 December 2011 for the BGPS and BGSBS, mortality assumptions are based on the Self Administered Pension Schemes SAPS S1 series light tables with a 105% multiplier issued by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, appropriate to each members year of birth, with an allowance for projected longevity improvements in line with the CMIs core projection model 2010 version, with a long-term rate of improvement of the projected mortality rates of 1% per annum.
Based on these assumptions, the life expectancies of pensioners on the measurement date and also of pensioners in 10 years time are as follows: Life expectancy ofpensioners years as at 31 December 2011 2021 Male age 60 28.1 28.9 Male age 65 23.4 24.1 Female age 60 29.2 30.1 Female age 65 24.5 25.3 If the life expectancy of a member currently age 60 was increased by one year, with consistent changes for members at other ages, the defined benefit obligation in respect of the BGPS and BGSBS would increase by $35m and the service cost for 2012 would increase by $2m.
The defined benefit obligation for the Comgs post-retirement employee benefit plan for healthcare was $110m 2010 $109m.
The effect of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed healthcare cost trend rates with all other assumptions remaining constant on the aggregate service and interest costs for the Comgs plan would be an increase or decrease of $1m 2010 $1m and on the defined benefit obligation would be an increase of $14m or a decrease of $12m 2010 $13m increase or $11m decrease.
