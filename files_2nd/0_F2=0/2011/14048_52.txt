The impact of changes in statutory tax rates relates principally to the reduction of the UK corporation tax rate from 27% to 26% from 1 April 2011, which was enacted on 29 March 2011.
In addition, the UK corporation tax rate was reduced from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012, which was enacted on 5 July 2011.
These changes have resulted in a deferred tax charge arising from the reduction in the balance sheet carrying value of deferred tax assets to reflect the anticipated rate of tax at which those assets are expected to reverse.
The UK Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main tax rate of 1% each year down to 23% by 1 April 2014.
We estimate that the future rate changes would further reduce the UK deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised but the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.
