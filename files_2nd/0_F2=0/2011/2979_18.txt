Overview Overview Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Financial Statements Financial statements Business r Business review eview Gover Governance finance 33 Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation The financial statements of the Group are made up to the Saturday nearest to 30 April.
The financial year for 2011 represents the 52 weeks ended 30 April 2011.
The comparative financial year for 2010 was 52 weeks ended 1 May 2010.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union, together with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRSs.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share based payments which are measured at fair value.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal respectively.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Changes to accounting standards The following new standards and amendments to standards, which are mandatory for the first time in the financial year beginning 2 May 2010, are relevant for the Group but have not had any impact in the current financial year: IFRS 3 revised Business combinations IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements IAS 38 amendment Intangible assets IFRS 5 amendment Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations IAS 36 amendment Impairment of assets IFRS 2 amendments Group cash-settled share based payment transactions IAS 32 amendment Classification of rights issues The following IFRIC interpretations, which are mandatory for the first time in the financial year beginning 2 May 2010, are either not currently relevant or material for the Group: IFRIC 16, Hedges of net investment in a foreign operation IFRIC 17, Distribution of non-cash assets to owners IFRIC 18, Transfer of assets from customers Where applicable comparative amounts have been restated to conform with current presentation.
Prior year adjustment In 2009 10 the Company accounted for the transfer of businesses from subsidiary undertakings.
The balance of investment in subsidiaries in excess of the net asset value remaining in the subsidiary should have been transferred to goodwill within the Company.
The 2009 10 Company balance sheet has been restated to include the transfer of 21.0m from investment in subsidiaries to goodwill.
Exchange differences The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentational currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies, which are those other than the functional currency of an entity, are recorded at the opening rate for the month in which the transaction occurs which is used as a reasonable approximation to the rate at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the income statement for the period except where they are part of a net foreign investment hedge when they are recognised in equity.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at the average rate during the period.
Differences on translation are recognised as a separate component of equity.
On disposal of a foreign operation the cumulative exchange differences for that operation are recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as assets and liabilities of that operation and are translated at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
uk 34 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Segment reporting Segmental information is presented using a management approach on the same basis as that used for internal reporting to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Chief Operating Decision Maker, who is responsible for resource allocation and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been identified as the Board of Directors.
Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the provision of goods and services to customers outside the Group net of returns, sales allowances and value added and other sales based taxes.
Revenue from goods and services is recognised at the point the Group fulfils its commercial obligations to the customer, the revenue and costs in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably and collectability is reasonably assured.
Share based payments The Group issues equity-settled share based payments to certain employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of options is recognised as an expense and is calculated using Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo models.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options vesting.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any service and performance conditions that are included in the assumptions about the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options which are expected to become exercisable.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the vesting period.
Impairment Assets that have an indefinite useful life, for example goodwill, are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for indications of impairment at each balance sheet date.
If there is an indication of impairment the recoverable amount of either the asset or the cash-generating unit to which it belongs is estimated.
Cash-generating units are used where an individual asset does not generate cash flows which are independent of other assets.
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use.
Value in use is the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from the asset or cash-generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement whenever the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffer an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of impairment at each reporting date.
Other operating income Rental income earned on investment property is recognised, in other operating income, in accordance with the substance of the relevant rental agreements.
Profits or losses on the disposal of property, plant and equipment represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Disposals are accounted for when there has been an unconditional exchange of contracts except where payment or completion is expected to occur significantly after exchange.
Exceptional items Profits losses on property disposals and non-recurring transactions which are material by virtue of their size or incidence such as major reorganisation costs and impairments are disclosed as exceptional items.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Overview Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Financial Statements Financial statements Business r Business review eview Gover Governance finance 35 Tax Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Companys subsidiaries operate and generate taxable income.
Deferred tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates of tax that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, and is not discounted.
Tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity: it is otherwise recognised in the income statement.
Dividends Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, paid.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired entity.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Other intangible assets Purchased brand names and other intangible assets are capitalised at cost.
Acquired software licences and software development costs are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Amortisation of intangible assets is calculated to write off the cost of the asset, on a straight line basis, over its expected useful life.
The expected useful lives generally applicable are: Brands 20 years Computer software 5 to 10 years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment in value.
Depreciation is provided to write down the cost of property, plant and equipment, on a straight line basis, to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives and residual values of assets are reviewed annually.
The estimated useful lives by asset category that are generally applicable are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings The shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful life Fixtures and fittings 7 to 15 years Computers 5 to 7 years Motor vehicles 4 years Other plant and machinery 7 to 10 years Borrowing costs Gross interest costs incurred on the financing of major projects are capitalised until the time that the assets are available for use.
Unless a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset, interest is capitalised using the weighted average interest rate of all non specific borrowings.
Where a specific borrowing is taken out to finance the asset interest is capitalised at the rate applicable to that borrowing.
uk 36 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Investment property Property that is held to earn rental income and for capital appreciation is separately disclosed as investment property.
Investment property is carried at depreciated historical cost.
Depreciation rates and useful lives of investment property are the same as those for property, plant and equipment.
Leasing commitments Leases are classified as finance leases where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised in fixed assets and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives and the period of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are released to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Investment in subsidiaries The Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is recognised at cost and is accounted for net of impairment losses.
Income from investments is recognised in the income statement to the extent that post-acquisition profits are received.
Distributions of pre-acquisition profits reduce the cost of the investment.
Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark down and shrinkage based on actual losses, ageing of inventories and sales trends.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the inventory to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year, the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Trade receivables and payables Trade receivables and payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted to the amount receivable or payable.
Receivables are stated net of a provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand, cash at bank, deposits repayable on demand and highly liquid investments.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents also includes bank overdrafts which are shown within borrowings and overdrafts in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Bank loans and overdrafts Bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Interest bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate model.
Provisions A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Provisions are calculated on a discounted basis when appropriate.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Overview Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Financial Statements Financial statements Business r Business review eview Gover Governance finance 37 Retirement benefit obligation The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution schemes and also participates in a multi-employer pension scheme in respect of its employees in The Netherlands.
The assets and liabilities of all schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
The Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities of the multi-employer scheme and, therefore, accounts for this scheme as a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit schemes is determined using the projected unit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.
The net retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair value of the scheme assets at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full, directly in equity in the period in which they occur and are presented in other comprehensive income.
Other income and expenses associated with the defined benefit scheme are recognised in the income statement.
The pension cost of defined contribution schemes is charged in the income statement as incurred.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments Derivative financial instruments derivatives are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
In accordance with its Treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative purposes.
Derivatives are stated at their fair value.
The fair value of interest rate contracts is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date, taking into account prevailing interest rates.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in other comprehensive income and any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When the asset or liability for the hedged transaction is recognised in the balance sheet, the associated gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in other comprehensive income is included in the carrying amount of the hedged asset or liability.
Gains or losses realised on cash flow hedges are then recognised in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings the gains or losses on the retranslation of the borrowings are recognised in equity.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
uk 38 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Critical estimates and judgements The preparation of consolidated financial statements under IFRSs requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Impairment of goodwill The Group is required to test whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations.
The use of this method requires the estimation of future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing operation of the cash-generating unit and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value.
Actual outcomes could vary significantly from these estimates.
Impairment of assets Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is determined based on value in use calculations prepared on the basis of managements assumptions and estimates.
Retirement benefits The present value of the defined benefit liabilities recognised in the balance sheet is dependent on the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds.
The net financing charge is dependent on both the interest rates of high quality corporate bonds and the assumed investment returns on scheme assets.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations, including mortality rates, are based in part on current market conditions.
New standards and interpretations New standards and interpretations of existing standards that are not yet effective and have not been early adopted by the Group At 30 April 2011 the following new standard which is expected to be relevant to the Group was issued but is not yet effective.
IFRS 9, Financial instruments effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
The standard introduces new requirements for classifying and measuring financial instruments.
This is still subject to endorsement by the European Union, but is currently expected to be applied to the Groups 2013 14 financial statements.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2011 Overview Overview Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Dir Directors r ectors report: eport: Financial Statements Financial statements Business r Business review eview Gover Governance finance 39 2 Segmental analysis The operating segments have been determined based on reports reviewed by the Board that are used to make strategic decisions.
Following the closure of the Polish operation in 2010 the management structure for Europe changed.
The Netherlands and Belgium were managed as a combined business by a single management team who had no other responsibilities.
Information is presented to the Board of Carpetright plc the Chief Operating Decision Maker on a combined basis.
As a result it is considered that the combined business forms a single reportable operating segment under IFRS 8.
The comparative segmental information has been restated to the new basis.
The reportable operating segments derive their revenue primarily from the retail of floor coverings and beds.
Central costs are incurred principally in the UK and are immaterial.
As such these costs are included within the UK & RoI segment.
Sales between segments are carried out at arms length.
The Groups revenue from external customers in the UK is 396.6m 2010 : 416.5m and the total revenue from external customers from other countries is 90.2m 2010 : 100.1m.
The total of non-current assets other than financial instruments and deferred tax assets located in the UK is 161.6m 2010 : 175.8m and the total of those located in other countries is 90.3m 2010 : 89.0m.
Carpetrights trade has historically shown no distinct pattern of seasonality with trade cycles more closely following economic indicators such as consumer confidence and mortgage approvals.

This change was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and has been incorporated into the financial statements.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year and would have the effect of reducing the deferred tax liability provided at 30 April 2011.
The Directors do not anticipate that these changes will materially change the deferred tax position presented in these financial statements.

9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held by the Groups Employee benefit Trust see note 25 which are treated as cancelled.
In order to compute diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
Those share options granted to employees and Executive Directors, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period, represent potentially dilutive ordinary shares.

The reduction in the amortisation recognised in administration expenses for the current and future years is 1.2m.
Instead it is subject to an impairment review at each reporting date or more frequently if there is an indication that it may be impaired.
Other intangibles are amortised and also tested for impairment when there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Goodwill impairment, intangible amortisation and impairment and reversals thereof are recognised in full in administration expenses in the income statement during the period in which they are identified.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash generating units to which it relates.
Group goodwill comprises purchased goodwill in respect of the following business acquisitions: 2011 2010 Subsidiary Acquisition date m m Carpetland BV 2002 20.0 19.5 Mays Holdings Ltd June 2005 4.7 4.7 Storey Carpets Ltd May 2007 15.3 15.3 Melford Commercial Properties Ltd March 2008 6.9 6.9 Ben fide Graaff July 2008 5.0 4.9 Sleepright UK Ltd December 2008 2.9 2.9 Total goodwill 54.8 54.2 Goodwill is impaired if the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and the value in use.
In the absence of a recent market transaction the recoverable amount is determined from value in use calculations.
These calculations are based on 10 year profit projections, the same period used by the Group for appraising the potential of business acquisitions, adjusted for non-cash items, planned working capital movements, capital expenditure and the expected value of the business at the end of the period.
The cash flow projections for the initial three year period are based on financial budgets and plans approved by the Board.
The key drivers are like-for-like sales growth, gross margin percentage and anticipated cost inflation.
Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated at a constant growth rate of 2.5% 2010: 2.5%.
The growth rate is in line with long term growth rates of the countries in which the Group operates.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 8.0% 2010: 8.3% and is based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reflect the risks of the businesses acquired.
Based on these calculations goodwill is not impaired.
An increase of 1% in the discount rate would not change the outcome of these calculations.
An increase of 3% in the discount rate would be required before any material impairment of goodwill would be indicated.

22 Retirement benefit obligations The Group operates a variety of pension schemes, principally in the UK, The Netherlands and Belgium.
They comprise defined benefit schemes where benefits are based on employees length of service and average final salary, and defined contribution schemes where the employer company pays a set contribution to the scheme.
The UK defined benefit schemes referred to in note 22 i a and the first two defined contribution schemes referred to in note 22 ii are accounted for by the Company.
i Defined benefit schemes a UK defined benefit schemes The Company operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay for its employees and has assumed the liability for the scheme previously operated by Storey Carpets Ltd Storeys.
The Company scheme was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 30 April 2010 and has been closed to new members since 31 March 2006.
The scheme previously operated by Storeys is also closed to new members and has no active members.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Company.
The assets of the Company scheme are invested in a Managed Fund operated by an independent investment manager.
Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2008 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 79% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
A deficit reduction plan has been agreed with the Trustees under which 0.4m was paid in the year 2010: 0.3m.
The assets of the Storeys scheme are held in independently managed funds.
The most recent actuarial review of the Storeys scheme was at 1 March 2008 when the actuarial value of the assets represented 84% of the benefits accrued to members.
uk 54 Notes to the accounts continued 22 Retirement benefit obligations continued The assets and liabilities of the schemes were valued on an IAS 19 basis at 30 April 2011 by a qualified actuary.
The numbers set out below are the aggregate of the two schemes.
1 Key assumptions used: 2011 2010 % % Expected rate of salary increases n a n a RPI inflation linked pension escalation 3.2 3.3 CPI inflation linked pension escalation Carpetright scheme 3.7 n a Discount rate 5.3 5.5 Deferred pension revaluation 3.0 3.6 Expected return on scheme assets 6.2 6.5 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions used for future life expectancy of members of the scheme are derived from industry data and standard tables.
Specifically the S1NMA table 2010: S1NMA table with medium cohort improvement has been used for male pensioners and the S1NFA table 2010: S1NFA table with medium cohort improvement for female pensioners projected by year of birth.
The most significant assumptions are the expected return on scheme assets, salary increases and the discount rate, of which the most sensitive assumption is the discount rate.
If this assumption increased or decreased by 0.1% the defined benefit obligation would change by 0.2m 2010: 0.2m.

It is not possible to identify the Groups share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme, and therefore in accordance with IAS19, the Group has taken the exemption for multi-employer pension schemes not to disclose pension scheme assets and liabilities.
Accordingly, although this scheme is a defined benefit scheme it is treated as a defined contribution scheme recognising the contributions payable in each period in the income statement.
Under the terms of the scheme, the scheme deficit is recovered through increased contributions from participating members.
At the period end the Group was unable to obtain a valuation of the industry schemes full surplus or deficit.
Contributions charged to the income statement amounted to 1.1m 2010: 1.1m.
ii Defined contribution schemes The Company launched a Group Personal Pension Plan GPP Plan in April 2006.
Contributions made by employees are matched by the Company to an upper limit.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company and are invested by an independent investment manager.
Contributions for the period amounted to 1.0m 2010: 0.8m.
In addition, the Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for subsidiary companies in Belgium and The Netherlands.
The Group makes contributions into the schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group and are invested by local insurance companies.
The contributions by the Group into individual company schemes for the period were a net charge of nil 2010: nil and contributions to industry collective schemes were 0.1m 2010: 0.1m.

These financial instruments are used to manage funding and liquidity requirements.
Other financial instruments which arise directly from the Groups operations include trade receivables and payables.
Exposure to credit, liquidity, foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks arise in the normal course of the Groups business operations and these risks are managed in accordance with the Groups treasury risk management strategy, which is also discussed in the Business Review in the section Management of liquidity risk and financing on page 12. a Credit risk The Group does not have significant concentrations of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
The Group is exposed to a small amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables, the majority of which relates to retail customers see note 15.
Retail customers are required to settle outstanding balances in cash or using a major credit card prior to goods being collected from delivered by the store.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with a minimum AA credit rating.
The maximum amount of credit risk is represented by the carrying amounts of financial assets.
b Liquidity risk The Group finances its operations from a mix of retained profits and bank borrowings achieved through term loans, revolving credit agreements and overdraft facilities.
Daily cash balances are forecast and surplus cash is placed on treasury deposit with the Groups bankers at commercial rates.
All counterparties have minimum AA credit ratings.

The Company has committed facilities to July 2015.
These facilities comprise a 22.0m amortising term loan, a 14.0m amortising term loan and a 45.0m revolving credit facility.
Repayments on the term loans cannot be redrawn.
There are a number of covenants which commit the Group to maintaining certain rates of leverage and fixed charge cover.
The Company is, and is expected to remain, in compliance with these covenants.
At 30 April 2011 the revolving credit facility, under the previous facility, had an undrawn amount of 22.5m 2010: 35.0m.
uk 58 Notes to the accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued c Foreign exchange risk Outside the UK the Group operates in The Republic of Ireland, The Netherlands and Belgium.
Revenues and expenses of these operations are denominated in Euros.
The Group mitigates currency risk in respect of the net investment in European operations by designating Eurodenominated borrowings as hedging instruments of Euro-denominated investments in foreign operations.
If the closing Sterling-Euro rate had been 0.01 points lower in the period the exchange difference reported in the statement of comprehensive income would have been 0.6m higher 2010: 0.6m higher.
At 30 April 2011 if Sterling had weakened strengthened by 10% against the Euro profit after tax for the year would have been 0.7m higher lower as a result of the translation of the Euro-denominated businesses.
Financial assets and liabilities and foreign operations are translated at the following rates of exchange: Euro Euro Zloty Zloty 2011 2010 2011 2010 Average rate 1.18 1.13 4.70 4.71 Closing rate 1.12 1.15 4.42 4.50 d Interest rate risk The Group has various borrowings bearing interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR rates.
Group policy is to manage interest rate risk by purchasing interest rate swap agreements to partially hedge the term loans.
The remainder is liable to interest at prevailing interest rates.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the Group has undertaken sensitivity analysis on its financial instruments which are affected by changes in interest rates.
This analysis has been prepared on the basis of a constant amount of net debt, a constant ratio of fixed to floating interest rates, and on the basis of hedging instruments in place at 30 April 2011 and 1 May 2010 respectively.
Consequently analysis relates to the situation at those dates and is not representative of the years then ended.
The following assumptions were made: balance sheet sensitivity to interest rates applies only to derivative financial instruments, as the carrying value of debt and deposits does not change as interest rates move gains or losses are recognised in equity or the income statement in line with the accounting policies set out in note 1 cash flow hedges were effective Based on the Groups net debt position at the year end a 1% change in interest rates would affect the Groups profit before tax by approximately 0.6m 2010: 0.3m.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group, after the impact of interest rate swaps, is as follows: 2011 2010 Weighted Weighted average average effective Floating Interest effective Floating Fixed Interest interest rate rate Fixed rate free Total interest rate rate rat free Total % m m m m % m m m m Sterling 0.1 4.5 10.8 15.3 0.3 3.6 8.9 12.5 Euro 1.2 3.6 4.7 8.3 1.2 4.6 4.7 9.3 Zloty 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.1 0.1 Total financial assets 8.3 15.6 23.9 8.3 13.6 21.9 Sterling 2.6 48.5 3.1 69.0 120.6 3.2 26.3 34.1 78.0 138.4 Euro 4.0 16.1 6.3 13.4 35.8 3.3 4.7 14.5 14.0 33.2 Zloty 0.4 0.4 Total financial liabilities 64.6 9.4 82.4 156.4 31.0 48.6 92.4 172.0 Capital management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern and retain financial flexibility in order to continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders.
The Group considers capital to be equity and net debt.
Net debt is disclosed in note 29.
The Group manages its capital by: continued focus on free cash flow generation: setting the level of capital expenditure and dividend in the context of the current year and forecast free cash flow: and monitoring the level of the Groups financial and leasehold debt in the context of Group performance.

Interest on the Sterling borrowing is charged at LIBOR plus a margin.
The Euro-denominated borrowings bear interest at the prevailing EURIBOR rate plus a margin.
Interest rate swaps fix a portion of the floating interest charge on term debt at fixed rates of interest ranging from 3.52% to 4.34% 2010: 3.52% to 5.25%.
The maturity profiles of the interest rate swaps are set to terminate prior to the underlying hedged borrowings.
