Management has adopted a ten-year projection period to assess each units value in use as it is confident based on past experience of the accuracy of long-term cash flow forecasts that these projections are reliable.
The cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period, extrapolated for a further five years at a growth rate of 5% for Offshore Projects & Operations and Engineering & Consulting Services cash-generating units.
For the Integrated Energy Services business the cash flows are based on field models over a ten-year horizon for Production Enhancement Contracts and Risk Service Contracts and on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period, extrapolated for a further five years at a growth rate of 2.5% for other operations as these include acquired businesses where there is less track record of achieving financial projections.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each group of cash-generating units 2011 2010 US$000 US$000 Offshore Projects & Operations unit 27,904 27,992 Engineering & Consulting Services unit 7,695 7,728 Integrated Energy Services unit 71,082 70,112 106,681 105,832 Key assumptions used in value in use calculations for the Offshore Projects & Operations, Engineering & Consulting Services and Integrated Energy Services units: Market share: the assumption relating to market share for the Offshore Projects & Operations unit is based on the unit re-securing those existing customer contracts in the UK which are due to expire during the projection period: for the Training business which is within Integrated Energy Services, the key assumptions relate to managements assessment of maintaining the units market share in the UK and developing further the business in international markets.
Capital expenditure: the Production Enhancement Contracts in the Integrated Energy Services unit require a minimum level of capital spend on the projects in the initial years to meet contractual commitments.
If the capital is not spent a cash payment of the balance is required which does not qualify for cost recovery.
The level of capital spend assumed in the value in use calculation is that expected over the period of the budget based on the current field development plans which assumes the minimum spend is met on each project and the contracts remain in force for the entire duration of the project.
Reserve volumes and production profiles: management has used its internally developed economic models of reserves and production as inputs in to the value in use for the Production Enhancement, Risk Service and Production Sharing Contracts.
Management has used an oil price of US$85 per barrel to determine reserve volumes on Production Sharing Contracts.
Tariffs and payment terms: the tariffs and payment terms used in the value in use calculations for the Production Enhancement and Risk Service Contracts are those specified in the respective contracts with assumptions consistent with the current field development plan where KPIs influence the payment terms.
Growth rate: estimates are based on managements assessment of market share having regard to macro-economic factors and the growth rates experienced in the recent past by each unit.
A growth rate of 5% per annum has been applied for the Offshore Projects & Operations and Engineering & Consulting Services cash-generating units for the remaining five years of the ten-year projection period and 2.5% per annum for the Integrated Energy Services cash-generating unit since it includes newly acquired businesses where there is less historic track record of achieving financial projections.
Discount rate: management has used a pre-tax discount rate of 13.8% per annum.
In 2010 a discount rate of 14.6% was used for the Offshore Projects & Operations, Engineering & Consulting Services, Production Solutions and Training Services cash-generating units and a rate of 13.4% for the Energy Developments cash generating unit.
The discount rate is derived from the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the Group and has been calculated using an estimated risk free rate of return adjusted for the Groups estimated equity market risk premium and the Groups cost of debt.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the cash-generating units, management believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the relevant unit to exceed its recoverable amount, after giving due consideration to the macro-economic outlook for the oil & gas industry and the commercial arrangements with customers underpinning the cash flow forecasts for each of the units.
