Dividends 2011 final dividend The Directors have recommended a final dividend of 7.68p per share, for the year ended 31 March 2011.

Key dates relating to this dividend are given below: 2011 final dividend timetable Ex-dividend date 29 June 2011 Record date 1 July 2011 DRIP election date 1 July 2011 AGM to approve the final dividend 7 July 2011 Payment date 19 July 2011 DRIP certificates received CREST accounts credited 25 July 2011 Change in financial year-end and dividend timetable In November 2010 Man announced its decision to move to a December year end to align its reporting cycle with that generally adopted in the asset management industry.
This means that the current financial period, which started on 1 April 2011, will be a nine month period to December 2011.
This change will result in dividend payments after 31 December 2011 being made earlier than in previous years.
We thought it would be useful to provide you with a comparison of relevant dates for calendar year 2011 and for calendar year 2012.
Please note, however, that future dates are provisional only and may be subject to change.
