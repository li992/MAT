Financial statements Strategy Performance & Marketplace Operating review Financial review Governance & other information 91 12 Marks & Spencer UK Pension Scheme interest in the Scottish Limited Partnership continued As general partner, Marks and Spencer plc has a right of pre-emption in respect of a transfer by the Pension Scheme of its limited partnership interest to another party.
This allows the general partner to direct that, instead of transferring the limited partnership interest to such a party, the general partner can instead nominate the transferee.
In addition, the partnership agreement includes a clause such that, following a default event including the appointment of an administrator, liquidator, receiver or similar officer in respect of Marks and Spencer plc or Marks and Spencer Group plc or on a relevant change of law, the net present value of the outstanding distributions becomes payable to the Pension Scheme by the Scottish Limited Partnership at the option of the Pension Scheme.
On the basis of the expected cash flows associated with such an event, the related financial liability has been fair valued at nil.

The resulting fair value is expensed over the service period of three years on the assumption that 20% of options will lapse over the service period as employees leave the Group.
