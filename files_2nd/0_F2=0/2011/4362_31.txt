AT A GLANCE CHAIRMANS STATEMENT BUSINESS REVIEW CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY DIRECTORS REPORT CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION REPORT NOTES TO THE COMPANY BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UK GAAP continued SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Retirement benefits The Company contributes to defined benefit and defined contribution pension Schemes on behalf of its employees.
These are managed on a Group basis and so the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the defined benefit Scheme in which it participates on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Scheme is operated on an aggregate basis with no segregation of the assets to individual participating employers and, therefore, the same contribution rate is charged to all participating employers: the contribution rate charged to each employer being affected by the experience of the Scheme as a whole.
The Scheme is therefore accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the Company.
This means that the pension charge reported in these financial statements is the same as the cash contributions due in the period.
Details of the financial position and key valuation assumptions of these Schemes can be found in Note 33 of the Groups Annual Report.
