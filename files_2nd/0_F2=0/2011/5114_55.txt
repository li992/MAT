This has resulted in the net credits to the prior year current tax and debits to prior year deferred tax referred to above.
Current tax liabilities at 30 September 2011 amounted to 9 million 2010: 28 million, of which substantially all relates to years prior to 2011 which remain open with the relevant tax authorities.
As in prior years a significant portion of this balance may not be settled in cash but accounted for as a movement in the deferred tax liability.
During the year ended 30 September 2011, net cash tax paid amounted to 2 million 2010: 14 million, which principally comprises foreign taxes paid.

The net overseas deferred tax asset is 11 million 2010: nil million.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of easyJet.
