Goodwill impairment review The group performs an annual goodwill impairment review, based on its cash generating units CGUs.
The CGUs that have associated goodwill are BT Global Services and BT Retails business units: BT Consumer, BT Business, BT Ireland and BT Enterprises.
These are the smallest identiable groups of assets that generate cash inows that are largely independent of the cash inows from other groups of assets, and to which goodwill is allocated.
Goodwill is allocated to the groups CGUs as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Ireland BT Enterprises Total m m m m m m At 1 April 2009 1,226 57 44 16 146 1,489 Acquisitions through business combinations 1 1 Disposals, adjustments and reclassications 3 8 17 5 29 2 Exchange differences 52 4 56 At 1 April 2010 1,172 65 61 21 113 1,432 Acquisitions through business combinations 6 6 Reclassications 15 15 a Impairment charges 39 39 Exchange differences 37 5 42 At 31 March 2011 1,102 65 46 21 123 1,357 a The goodwill impairment charges recognised in 2011 mainly relate to an operational restructuring of a business acquired several years ago.
BT GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT & FORM 20-F 2011 119 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 13.
Intangible assets continued The key assumptions used in performing the value in use calculations in 2011 were as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Ireland BT Enterprises Discount rate 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% 10.0% Perpetuity growth rate 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% The key assumptions used in performing value in use calculations in 2010 were as follows: BT Retail BT Global Services BT Consumer BT Business BT Ireland BT Enterprises Discount rate 10.8% 10.8% 10.8% 10.8% 10.8% Perpetuity growth rate 2.5% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% 2.0% Recoverable amount The value in use of each CGU is determined using cash ow projections derived from financial plans approved by the Board covering a threeyear period and a further two years approved by the line of business and group senior management team.
They reect managements expectations of revenue, EBITDA growth, capital expenditure, working capital and operating cash ows, based on past experience and future expectations of business performance.
Cash ows are also adjusted downwards to reect the different risk attributes of each CGU.
Cash ows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated using perpetuity growth rates.
Discount rate The pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash ow forecasts are derived from the groups post-tax weighted average cost of capital.
The assumptions used in the calculation of the groups weighted average cost of capital are benchmarked to externally available data.
Growth rates The perpetuity growth rates are determined based on the long-term historical growth rates of the regions in which the CGU operates, and they reect an assessment of the long-term growth prospects of the sector in which the CGU operates.
The growth rates have been benchmarked against external data for the relevant markets.
None of the growth rates applied exceed the long-term historical average growth rates for those markets or sectors.
Sensitivities For the BT Retail CGUs, significant headroom exists in each CGU and, based on the sensitivity analysis performed, no reasonably possible changes in the assumptions would cause the carrying amount of the CGUs to exceed their recoverable amount.
For BT Global Services, the value in use exceeds the carrying value of the CGU by approximately 895m.
The following changes in assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to fall below the carrying value: a reduction in the perpetuity growth rate from the 2.5% assumption applied to a revised assumption of a 0.7% decline or more an increase in the discount rate from the 10.0% assumption applied to a revised assumption of 12.2% or more a reduction in the projected operating cash ows across five years by 25% or more.
