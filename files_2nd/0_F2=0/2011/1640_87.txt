Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to CGUs as follows: Asia Pacific eMeA Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2011 000 000 000 000 On the acquisition of: Tribon Solutions AB 9,227 7,417 383 17,027 Realitywave Inc. 244 490 244 978 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 Logimatic Software A S 2,008 2,008 2,008 6,024 ADB Systemer AB 219 1,681 292 2,192 12,035 11,596 3,903 27,534 Asia Pacific EMEA Americas Total Year ended 31 March 2010 000 000 000 000 Tribon Solutions AB 8,576 6,892 356 15,824 Realitywave Inc. 260 520 260 1,040 AEA Technology 108 976 1,084 Kyokuto Boeki Kaisha 229 229 9,173 7,412 1,592 18,177 The recoverable amounts of CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on managements estimates of growth in those specific markets based on past experience and external market information.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management for the year ending 31 March 2012 and extrapolates cash flows for future years based on an average estimated growth rate of 2% for each CGU 2010 2%, representing the long term average growth rate for the Groups CGUs.
Future cash flows are discounted in line with the weighted average cost of capital of approximately 10% pre-tax 2010 10%.
Whilst it is conceivable that a key assumption in the calculation could change, the Directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated recoverable amount exceeds the carrying value.
