The following projections should therefore be treated with caution.
Assumptions implicit in the following projections are: the return on assets from 31 December 2011 is 5.0 per cent per annum: contributions to the Scheme will continue throughout 2012 in accordance with the current schedule of contributions in place at the date of signing this report: and there will be no changes to the terms of the Scheme.

Pension liability continued Sensitivity and risk The results of the calculations are sensitive to the assumptions used.
The balance sheet position revealed by FRS 17 calculations must be expected to be volatile, principally because the market value of assets with a significant exposure to equities is being compared with a liability assessment derived from corporate bond yields.
At 31 December 2011, a one percentage point change in this assumption would have had the following effects on the closing defined benefit obligation: Discount rate: 4.6% pa Discount rate: Discount rate: as used for report 3.6% pa 5.6% pa $ million $ million $ million Defined benefit obligation 31.3 37.6 26.1 The key risks which could significantly impact the balance sheet, and to a lesser extent the profit and loss account, are as follows: falls in asset values which are not offset by a rise in the discount rate used to value liabilities: a reduction in the discount rate, which will increase the value placed on the Schemes liabilities: an increase in price inflation and or salary inflation: and improving life expectancy lower mortality rates resulting in benefits being paid for longer.
Unfunded pensions The company is paying an unfunded pension to a former director in regard to which annual increases and a reversionary spouses pension apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2011 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of UK unfunded pensions is US$0.9 million 2010: US$0.9 million.
