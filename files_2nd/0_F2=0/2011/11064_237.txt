Share capital and reserves The Company was incorporated on 30 March 2011 as part of a corporate reorganisation under which it became the new UK incorporated holding company for the business previously held by NWR NV.
The reorganisation was undertaken by way of an offer by the Company to the shareholders of NWR NV to exchange shares in the Company for their shares in NWR NV on a one-for-one basis.
Reincorporation On 11 April 2011, the boards of NWR NV and NWR Plc announced a recommended share offer for all of the A ordinary shares of EUR 0.40 each in the capital of NWR NV the Existing A shares the Offer.
The condition of the Offer relating to acceptances was met on 5 May 2011 the first closing date and the Company became the new holding company when it issued 256,780,388 new A shares to accepting shareholders of NWR NV on 6 May 2011 being approximately 97% of the Existing A shares, resulting to non-controlling interest of approximately 3%.
In addition, after the Offer became wholly unconditional in all respects, NWR Plc acquired 10,000 B ordinary shares in the share capital of NWR NV by issuing the same number of new B ordinary shares of NWR Plc being 100% of the B ordinary shares in the capital of NWR NV.
NWR Plc issued the above number of A and B shares with a nominal value of EUR 7.00 per share.
The difference between the nominal value of the new A and B shares and carrying value of net assets acquired is recognised as a change in consolidated equity, resulting in the recognition of negative merger reserve of EUR 1,630,472 thousand.
On 11 May 2011, the Company reduced its share capital by reducing the nominal value of each of the A and B ordinary shares from EUR 7.00 per share to EUR 0.40 per share.
This reduction of capital created distributable reserve of approximately EUR 1,694,817 thousand in NWR Plc.
After the subsequent four closings, the Company received valid acceptances in respect of approximately 99.6% of the Existing A shares in total, resulting in a non-controlling interest decrease of about 2.6%, as of 30 June 2011.
On 19 July 2011, NWR Plc initiated a compulsory squeeze-out procedure in accordance with Dutch law under which NWR Plc intends to acquire all remaining outstanding shares in NWR NV.
On 30 September 2011, pursuant to a private share-for-share exchange, NWR Plc acquired an additional 397,969 Existing A shares, taking NWR Plcs total shareholding in NWR NV to 264,119,398 Existing A shares approximately 99.8%, in exchange for the Company issuing 397,969 A shares at a value of EUR 6.35 per share, resulting in the recognition of a share premium of EUR 2,368 thousand.
The issuances of A shares after each closing date and in connection with the private share-for-share exchange were treated as acquisitions of the non-controlling interests with the impact recognised directly into equity.
The reincorporation did not lead to a change in control and did not result in any changes to the day-to-day operations of the Group.
