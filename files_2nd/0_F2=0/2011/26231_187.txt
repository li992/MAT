This scenario does not reect management action which could be taken to reduce the impact of a decrease in interest rates.
In a scenario where the bases are not adjusted for regulatory restrictions i. e. changes to the reinvestment rate are ignored, the sensitivitiy to a -1% interest rate movement would be -7m.
In calculating the alternative values, all other assumptions are left unchanged.
In practice, items of the Groups experience may becorrelated.
The Group seeks to actively manage its asset and liability position.
A change in market conditions may lead to changes in the asset allocation or charging structure which may have a more, or less, significant impact on the value of the liabilities.
The analysis also ignores any second order effects of the assumption change, including the potential impact on the Group asset and liability position and any second order tax effects.
These stresses use the assets that back the liabilities.
Any excess assets have not been stressed in these calculations.
The sensitivity of the profit to changes in assumptions may not be linear.
They should not be extrapolated to changes of a much larger order.
The change in interest rate test assumes a 100bps change in the gross redemption yield on a xed interest securities together with a 100bps change in the real yields on variable securities.
Valuation interest rates are assumed to move in line with market yields adjusted to allow for the impact of FSA regulations.
In the sensitivity for credit spreads, corporate bond yields have increased by 100bps, gilt and approved security yields unchanged, and there has been no adjustment to the default assumptions.
The ination stress adopted is a 1% pa increase in ination resulting in a 1% pa reduction in real yield and no change to the nominal yield.
In addition the expense ination rate is increased by 1% pa.
The reinsurer stress shown is equal to the technical provisions ceded to that insurer.
The annuitant mortality stress is a 1% reduction in the mortality rates for immediate and deferred annuitants with no change to the mortality improvement rates.
Default of largest reinsurer: The largest reinsurer was deducted at an entity level by mathematical reserves ceded.
The largest reinsurer is Swiss Re.
The increase in reserves is consistent with the reinsured reserves.
Details of IGD sensitivity analysis can be found in Table 2 of Note 46.
The Group also uses embedded value financial statements information to manage risk.
The effect of alternative assumptions on the long term embedded value, prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the European Insurance CFO Forum in October 2005 are contained within the Supplementary Financial Statements on page 216 of the Annual Report and Accounts.

The ultimate cost to the Group is greater as a proportion of the catastrophe reinsurance cover is placed with Legal & General Assurance Society Limited, which is exposed to 70% of claims between 30m and 50m, 50% of claims between 50m and 120m and 20% of claims between 120m and 265m.
The impact of a 1 in 500 year modelled windstorm and coastal ood event would exceed the upper limit of the catastrophe cover by approximately 192m 2010: 131m, with an estimated total cost to LGI of 245m 2010: 180m and to the Group of 317m 2010: 227m.
