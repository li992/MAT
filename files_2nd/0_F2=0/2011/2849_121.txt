The effect of the Scheme as a whole can be summarised as follows: a While Scheme creditors retain their rights against Scheme companies, and may bring proceedings against Scheme companies for declaratory relief to determine whether they have a claim and, if so, of what amount, their rights, subject as provided in sub-paragraphs k and m below are only enforceable against CCS under the terms of the Scheme guarantee: b CCS was funded in the first instance with a sum of 40 million which represented what was considered to be a sufficient sum to discharge CCSs liabilities to Scheme creditors which became payable over at least 8 years from 1 January 2006: c Every three years there is an assessment of the projected Scheme claims against Scheme companies payable by CCS over the following 9 years, by reference to which the Funding Requirement, is established: d The use of Scheme funds is restricted to the payment of established Scheme claims and Scheme creditor costs: e In the event that an assessment reveals a shortfall between the Scheme assets and the Funding Requirement, the Company will top up CCSs funding over the following three years provided that sufficient cash is available, Capes obligation being limited to 70% of the Groups consolidated adjusted operational cash flow including, for example, adjustments to take account of acquisitions, an element of capital expenditure and repayment of borrowing facilities : f Should the Company not be able to meet its top up obligation in any one year, it will be required to make good the shortfall in the next year, again subject to sufficient cash being available: g Alongside the Funding Requirement there is the Scheme Funding Requirement which is assessed every year by reference to projected Scheme claims against Scheme companies payable by CCS over the next 6 years: h If at any time the ratio of the Scheme assets to the Scheme Funding Requirement the Scheme Funding Percentage falls below 60%, CCS will have the ability to reduce the percentage the Payment Percentage of each established claim which it pays to Scheme creditors until such time as the Scheme Funding Percentage is restored to 60%: i Cape is permitted to pay dividends provided that at the time of payment i the Scheme Funding Percentage in relation to the last preceding financial year was certified to be not less than 110%, ii the Directors of Cape certify that they anticipate that the Scheme Funding Percentage for the current and following financial year will be not less than 110% and iii the Payment Percentage has not at any time within the previous 40 business days been below 100%.
