2011 saw another increase in Gold Reserves Petropavlovsks JORC-compliant and Resources reserves and resources estimate due to the success of the Groups on-going exploration programme.
The Group maintains its commitment to report its Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code 2004.
While the Russian Classi cation System for reporting reserves and resources remains in use within the Russian legal environment, forming the basis of the Groups accountability to the Russian state, Group reporting on reserves and resources at its hard-rock assets to investor audiences is carried out in accordance with the JORC Code 2004.
Group in-house specialists, in co-operation with external independent advisers, prepared an update of Group gold Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves in accordance with the JORC Code 2004 as at 1 January 2012.
The Ore Reserve statement was audited by independent technical consultants WAI, whilst the Mineral Resource statement was prepared by the Group internally.
A summary of the Groups gold Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources in accordance with the guidelines of the JORC Code 2004 is shown below: Ore Reserves as of 1 January 2012 in accordance with JORC Code 2004 Category Tonnage Kt Grade g t Au Gold Moz Total Ore Reserves Proven 40,808 1.29 1.69 Probable 241,139 1.10 8.56 Total Proven Probable 281,947 1.13 10.25 Non-refractory Ore Reserves Proven 17,911 0.86 0.78 Probable 111,948 1.34 4.36 Total Proven Probable 129,859 1.23 5.13 Refractory Ore Reserves Proven 22,896 1.31 0.91 Probable 129,192 1.03 4.21 Total Proven Probable 152,088 1.05 5.12 Note: Figures may not add up due to rounding.
As with the 2011 estimate, the above reserve statement was derived using a long-term gold price assumption of US$1,000 oz applied for all assets, with the exception of Albyn and Visokoe where a gold price of US$1,200 oz was used.
The two different gold price assumptions are as at the date of the last overall feasibility assessment for each project.
Operating cost projections at Albyn and Visokoe were re-evaluated in Q4 2011, whilst technical and economical parameters for the other assets remained unchanged from those at the time of the last annual review.
