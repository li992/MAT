A tax debit in respect of share-based compensation for deferred taxation of 821,000 2010: credit of 342,000 has been recognised in the Statement of Changes in Equity in the year.
b Factors affecting tax charge: The tax assessed on the profit on ordinary activities for the year is lower than the standard rate of income tax in the UK of 26.5% 2010: 28%.
The differences are reconciled below: 2011 2010 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 33,761 28,808 Profit on ordinary activities at standard rate of tax in the UK 26.5% 2010: 8,947 8,066 28% Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 468 928 Non deductible amortisation of intangibles 115 125 Adjustments in respect of previous years 591 185 Utilisation of tax losses brought forward previously not recognised 1,912 2,932 Current tax losses not available for offset 693 416 Effect of overseas tax rates 3 73 Other 302 419 Tax expense see a above 8,025 6,764 c Factors that may affect future tax charges: The Group may claim a Schedule 23 tax credit in respect of certain share-based compensation benefits.
Due to the requirements of IAS 12, in conjunction with IFRS 2, the amount of benefit that can be recognised in the Income Statement has been restricted in the current year and may also be restricted in future periods.
Any surplus tax credit has been recorded in equity.
There are temporary differences which arise in relation to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
Since the Group is able to control dividend distributions from these companies it is unlikely that further UK tax on repatriation of these earnings will be payable in the foreseeable future.
Consequently no deferred tax liability has been provided.
116 STATUTORY INFORMATION d Deferred income tax: The amounts recognised and unrecognised for deferred income tax are set out below: Recognised Unrecognised Recognised Unrecognised 2011 2011 2010 2010 000 000 000 000 Depreciation in advance of capital 485 - 500 - allowances Other short-term temporary differences 5,360 - 6,158 - Tax losses 3,004 2,323 3,422 1,908 Net deferred income tax liability asset 1,871 2,323 2,236 1,908 The Group has tax losses in net terms of 2,323,000 2010: 1,908,000 that may be available for use by offset against future taxable profits in the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these losses as the Group cannot foresee profitability in the companies where the losses arose with sufficient certainty.
Included within other short term temporary differences are deferred tax assets in respect of potential Schedule 23 tax benefits of 1,262,000 2010: 1,748,000 and a deferred tax liability in respect of the amortisation of certain intangible assets acquired, recognised in accordance with IAS 38, of 6,375,000 2010: 8,071,000.
At 31 December 2011 the net deferred income tax position is represented by a deferred income tax asset of 4,976,000 2010: 6,356,000 and a deferred income tax liability of 6,847,000 2010: 8,592,000. e Reconciliation of movement on deferred tax liability: 2011 2010 000 000 At 1 January 8,592 7,298 Retranslation of opening balances 98 103 Deferred tax liability arising on intangible assets acquired 213 2,518 4 Reversal of temporary differences arising on the amortisation of intangibles 1,564 945 Other temporary differences arising in the period 8 107 Change in rate from 27% to 25.25% 288 69 Deferred tax liability at 31 December 6,847 8,592 117 SDL Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the Accounts f Reconciliation of movement on deferred tax asset: 2011 2010 000 000 At 1 January 6,356 5,621 Retranslation of opening balances - 14 Temporary differences arising in the period 1,254 149 Deferred income tax asset arising on share-based payments recorded in 335 528 Income Statement Deferred income tax asset arising on share-based payments recorded in 821 342 statement of changes in equity Other temporary differences arising in the period 429 - Change in rate from 27% to 25.25% 69 - Deferred tax asset at 31 December 4,976 6,356 On 23 March 2011 the Chancellor announced the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011 and a further reduction to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.
These changes became substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and 5 July 2011 respectively and therefore the effect of these rate reductions creates a reduction in the deferred tax asset of 69,000 and a reduction in the deferred tax liability of 288,000 which has been included in the figures above.
This reduction in rate has resulted in a net credit to deferred tax current tax charge of 219,000.
The Chancellor proposed changes to further reduce the main rate of corporation tax by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014, but these changes have not yet been substantively enacted and therefore are not included in the figures above.
The overall effect of the further reductions from 25% to 23%, if these were applied to the deferred tax balance at 31 December 2011, would be to further reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately 32,000.
These reductions in the UK corporation tax rate will reduce the Groups future current tax charge.
DIVIDENDS 2011 2010 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2010 of 4,328 - 5.5pence per share A final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 5.8 pence per share will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included as a liability in the financial statements.
EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on a profit after tax of 25,736,000 2010: 22,044,000 and 78,666,436 2010: 77,640,587 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period.
The diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by including in the weighted average number of shares the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares related to committed share options as described in note 19.
For 2011 the diluted ordinary shares were based on 81,115,987 ordinary shares that included 2,449,551 potential ordinary shares.
The following reflects the income and share data used in the calculation of adjusted earnings per share computations: 2011 2010 000 000 Profit for the year 25,736 22,044 Amortisation of intangible fixed assets 5,903 6,587 Less: tax benefit associated with the amortisation of intangible fixed assets 1,564 1,693 Adjusted profit for the year 30,075 26,938 Adjusted earnings per share is shown as the Directors believe that earnings before amortisation is reflective of the underlying performance of the business.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING OF GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLES WITH INDEFINITE LIVES The Group has goodwill that has been acquired through business combinations but does not hold any intangible assets that have indefinite lives ascribed to them.
The approach of the Group is to test impairment at the cash generating unit level.
This is the lowest level of unit at which the Group is effectively able to manage and monitor performance, cash flow and goodwill.
Four cash generating units have been determined for testing: Language Services, Language Technologies, Web Content Management and Structured Content Management.
Where possible the goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to these cash generating units and full attribution of overheads and group costs has been made to each of the units in testing impairment.
4 In order to evaluate the recoverable amounts relating to the cash-generating units the following key information should be noted.
The recoverable amount has been determined using the detailed projections from the 2012 annual plan projected for a five year period and subsequently into perpetuity, with a discount rate applied.
Differential discount rates were used reflecting a different risk weighting based on relative maturity and size of the different cash generating units with 10.2% applied to Language Services 2010: 10.6%, 11.9% to Language Technologies 2010: 12.3%, 11.1% to Web Content Management 2010: 11.5% and 11.3% to Structured Content Management 2010: 11.7%.
These reflect the relative maturity of the businesses and in aggregate approximate a group cost of capital of 10.8% for 2011 2010:11.3%.
The budget has been prepared at the cash generating unit level based on historical trends adjusted for expected events.
These individual budgets have been aggregated as the basis for the 2012 annual plan.
The discount rate has been calculated as the weighted average cost of capital.
125 SDL Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the Accounts This methodology places strong emphasis on early year cash flows in evaluating impairment.
The valuation is on a value in-use basis but has retained average perpetual growth rates from the 3.1% used in 2010.
Differential perpetual growth rates have been used reflecting the relative maturity, penetration and profile of the cash generating units with 2% applied to the Language Services business and 4% applied to the Language Technologies business, Web Content Management business and Structured Content Management business.
Whilst the rates of growth vary across individual cash generating units, a long term average growth rate for the 5 years pre-perpetuity of 8% has been used for the tests, when considering SDL as a whole.
Differential growth rates have been applied to the different cash-generating units according to market growth projections of 5-10% for Language Services, 10-15% for Language Technologies and 5-15% for Web Content Management and Structured Content Management.
It should be noted that whilst there is increasing linkage between the cash generating units in terms of cross selling and mutual exploitation of synergy no benefits have been assumed here.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to cash-generating units: 2011 2010 000 000 Language Services 21,050 21,047 Language Technologies 64,327 64,503 Web Content Management 36,280 34,958 Structured Content Management 9,635 9,666 131,292 130,174 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions Having performed its impairment tests and having analysed the various sensitivities to these tests management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the relevant units to exceed their recoverable amounts.
Next impairment test The next impairment tests will be performed at the 2012 year end.
However, management continues to monitor the performance of its cash generating units closely and should it believe a significant event has occurred which deteriorates the forward operating prospects of the business it will move to bring forward these tests.

118,030 ordinary shares of 1p each were allotted under the SDL Save As You Earn Scheme at a price range of 256 to 286 pence per share for an aggregate consideration of 302,656.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENT PLANS On 23 April 2010, following shareholder approval, the SDL Share Option Scheme 2010 was adopted.
This replaced the SDL Share Option Scheme 1999 for which options are still exercisable.
The SDL Share Option Scheme 2010 permits the granting of both options approved by HM Revenue and Customs within the statutory 30,000 limit and unapproved options, subject to performance conditions.
From 2010 onwards, all options have been granted in accordance with these rules.
The SDL Long Term Share Incentive Plan, which was approved by shareholders in April 2006 the 2006 plan, expired for the purposes of new awards in April 2011.
No further awards could be made after the expiry date but existing awards will remain protected although they will only vest to the extent that the related performance conditions are met.
The 2006 plan has been replaced with the SDL Long Term Share Incentive Plan 2011 the 2011 Plan which received approval from shareholders in April 2011.
The 2011 Plan is broadly similar in construction.
It has been updated to reflect current law and market practice and the proposed performance conditions are designed to be more closely aligned to the Companys current business strategy and objectives.
On 18 May 2011, 161,940 shares were granted under the 2011 Plan to the Executive Directors when the market price was 6.70, with a performance period of three years from date of grant.
Senior management employees received awards of 443,535 and 26,772 on 18 May 2011 and 1 July 2011 respectively.
On 24 April 2008 a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme was formally approved by the shareholders at the AGM.
The original 2008 scheme matured in 2011 and has provided good returns for participating employees.
Following the success of the UK SAYE schemes, in 2011 an international version was rolled out to SDL plcs subsidiary companies in the Netherlands.
The rules are based on those of the UK in that employees must be eligible and there is a monthly savings contract over a 3 year period.
In 2011, options were granted to both UK and Netherlands scheme participants at 80% of the prevailing market price.
The market price is taken the day prior to the date of invitations to apply for an option.
There are no performance conditions attached to the exercise of these options.
These options may be exercised within a fixed sixmonth period, three years from the date of grant or being made redundant.
The expense recognised for all share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 31 December 2011 is 2,867,000 2010: 1,886,000.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES An explanation of the Groups financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 50 to 59.
Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is not significant in 2011 as the Group has had no borrowings during the year.
At the balance sheet date the Group retains committed facilities to the value of 20 million.
134 STATUTORY INFORMATION To ensure adequate working capital the Group maintains cash deposits and these deposits are affected by any movements in rates of interest generally.
These cash deposits are generally receiving interest income at LIBOR or USD, EURO equivalent plus a margin.
The Group seeks to place all cash surplus to operational requirements in secure money market funds.
To enhance the interest earning capacity of the Group, processes have been put in place to ensure that cash balances held by subsidiary companies are kept as low as operationally possible.
With regard to relative interest rates, adequate cash is retained in key operating currencies to fund the operational needs of the Group.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 percent change in the UK interest rate: 2011 2010 Proft before tax gain loss 000 000 1 % 286 88 - 1 % 286 88 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 percent change in the Euro interest rate: 2011 2010 Proft before tax gain loss 000 000 1 % 164 122 - 1 % 164 122 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 percent change in the US$ interest rate: 2011 2010 Proft before tax gain loss 000 000 1 % 127 119 - 1 % 127 119 Liquidity Risk: The Groups objective is to optimise the funds currently available to it in order to maintain the lowest operational borrowing profile necessary.
At the end of 2011 the Group had no external borrowings and approximately 70 million of net cash.
Underpinning this philosophy are processes to manage operating cash flow, with a focus on approvals policy for significant cash outlays and credit control.
4 Foreign Currency Risk: A significant amount of business is done with customers in both the USA and Continental Europe with approximately 47% of total invoicing done in US Dollar and 35% in Euro.
The most significant sensitivity is to the US Dollar as illustrated below.
This overseas client base gives rise to short-term debtors and cash balances in both US Dollars and Euros.
Consequently, the movements in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates affect the Group Balance Sheet, as well as the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Group seeks to manage this risk in the first instance by looking to a natural hedge and ensuring where possible currency needs in the USA are funded from the settlement of US Dollar denominated debtors.
After a review of effectiveness the Group has not entered into any new US Dollar hedges since 2008.
At the end of 2011 the Group has no hedges outstanding.
In addition, the Group has exposure on the Balance Sheet to the movements in US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates as a result of intangible assets held in non functional currency, the retranslation of US and continental European overseas subsidiaries net assets into UK Sterling for consolidation purposes and finally intercompany loan and trading relationships held in non functional currency.
In the case of the latter, this can have an impact on net profitability where the intercompany relationships are not treated for accounting purposes as equity loans.
135 SDL Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the Accounts The Consolidated Income Statement is also affected by movements in the US Dollar Sterling and Euro Sterling exchange rates when sales to customers are converted to Sterling at the date of the sales transaction, as this will vary from month to month.
This is partially offset by the effect of retranslating US Dollar and Euro denominated costs into UK Sterling from month to month.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 cent change in the US Dollar exchange rate 2011 2010 000 000 Proft before tax gain loss 1cent 289 259 - 1 cent 293 262 Statement of Financial Position increase decrease in net assets 1cent 492 474 - 1 cent 498 480 The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a 1 cent change in the Euro exchange rate 2011 2010 000 000 Proft before tax gain loss 1 cent 59 38 - 1 cent 60 39 Statement of Financial Position increase decrease in net assets 1 cent 1,031 1,010 - 1 cent 1,048 1,027 Based on the Statement of Financial Position at 31 December Economic Conditions Credit Control Risk: Given the economic conditions at the end of 2011, SDL continues to benefit from a diverse list of major clients of which no client contributes more than 5% of sales.
The Group is however continuing to place emphasis on sound application of credit control processes given the recent deterioration in macro-economic conditions.
The Group has made provision against trade receivables to reflect specific collection risks identified.
Capital Management: The Board monitors the total equity and the cash and cash equivalents balance in considering its retained capital and when and how a return of capital to shareholders is appropriate.
The Group maintains a strong capital base so as to maintain employee, customer, market, investor and creditor confidence in the business and to ensure that it continues to operate as a going concern.
The annual dividends have increased by 5.5%.
The strategy of the Board is to pursue strong profitable growth by reinvesting operating cash flows into the business whilst offering a nominal return to those investors who value a yield in addition to growth.
DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Interest rate risk profile of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December is as follows: At 31 December 2011 Within 1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 More Total year years years years years than 5 Floating rate years 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash 70,408 - - - - - 70,408 At 31 December 2010 Within 1 1-2 2-3 3-4 4-5 More Total year years years years years than 5 Floating rate years 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Cash 46,628 - - - - - 46,628 Maturity of financial liabilities The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2011: Less than Over12 Total 12 months months 000 000 000 Other liabilities 839 1,661 2,500 Trade and other payables 11,120 - 11,120 11,959 1,661 13,620 The above table excludes accruals and deferred income.
The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2010: 4 Less than Over12 Total 12 months months 000 000 000 Other liabilities 1,224 1,370 2,594 Trade and other payables 12,341 - 12,341 13,565 1,370 14,935 The above table has been restated to exclude accruals and deferred income.
The fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated by reviewing purchase documentation and forecast information.
This represents a level 3 measurement in the fair value hierarchy under IFRS 7.
Contingent consideration is cash, therefore has been recorded as a liability.
Any subsequent remeasurement to this liability will be recorded in the Income Statement.
137 SDL Annual Report and Financial Statements 2011 Notes to the Accounts Borrowing facilities The Group has one borrowing facility available to it.
At 31 December 2011 the facility available was 20 million 2010: 20 million.
The borrowing facility has been renegotiated in the year to extend the facility until 2014. Credit risk Under the RBS facility agreement the SDL Group is required to retain at least 60% of its cash held by the Group within a Charging Group defined as a list of Charging Subsidiaries and the borrower SDL Plc.
This exposes the Group to counterparty risk based on the banks with whom the Charging Group holds cash deposits.
The most significant counterparty risk is with RBS.
The maximum credit risk exposure related to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the balance sheet date.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The carrying value of financial assets and liabilities approximate their fair value.
Fair values of assets and liabilities are based on their carrying values.
The directors consider that there were no material differences between the book values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities at each year-end.
The fair values have been calculated using the market interest rates where applicable.
There are no hedging arrangements in place as at 31 December 2011 2010: None.
The Group had no outstanding borrowings on loan facilities held with RBS at 31 December 2011or 2010 and therefore had no sensitivity to interest rate risk on these facilities at the balance sheet date.
The interest rates that the Group would pay under the facilities are linked directly to the 3-month LIBOR rate.
EVENTS AFTER THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION DATE On 27 January 2012 the Group acquired 100% of Alterian plc a company listed on the London Stock Exchange and based in England for 68.7 million of which 48.7 million was funded from the Groups existing cash reserves and 20.0 million was drawn against the Groups existing bank facility.
The principal activities of Alterian plc are the provision of data analytics, campaign management and social media capabilities.
The Chairmans statement describes the primary reasons for the business combination.
Annual disclosures required under IFRS 3 Revised will be included in the 31 December 2012 annual financial statements and in the 30 June 2012 interim financial statements once the initial accounting for the business combination has been undertaken.
There are no other known events occurring after the statement of financial position date that require disclosure.
The Directors are recommending that a final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 5.8 pence per ordinary share be paid to the shareholders whose names appear on the register at the close of business on 18 May 2012 with payment on 15 June 2012.
The Ex-dividend date will be 16 May 2012.
This recommendation will be put to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
