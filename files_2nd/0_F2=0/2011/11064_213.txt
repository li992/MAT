Income tax expense and deferred tax The corporate income tax in 2011 and 2010 is calculated in accordance with tax regulations applied in the country of each Group entitys tax residence, i. e. for the Czech entities at the rate of 19%, Dutch entity 25.5%, Polish entities 19%.
The Group applies a tax rate of 19% for an effective tax rate reconciliation due to the fact the Group, sofar, pays income tax only in Czech Republic, through OKD.
The Company as a Dutch tax resident and NWR NV suffered fiscal losses in this and previous periods, and as such, no corporate income tax is due in the Netherlands.
No deferred tax was recognised, as it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available to utilise the benefits from the deferred tax assets.
The net expense in 2010 was composed of a EUR 54,006 thousand income tax expense offset by a one-off tax reclaim in the amount of EUR 23,195 thousand, that arose from the reversal of the Czech tax authoritys position on certain interest expenses which were previously deemed non-tax deductible.
