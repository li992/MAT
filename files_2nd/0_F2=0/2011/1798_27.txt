The recoverable amount of goodwill is based on value in use.
Cash flow forecasts are based on the expected workload of each cashgenerating unit CGU giving consideration to the current level of confirmed orders and anticipated orders.
Cash flow forecasts for the next four years 2010: three years are based on the Groups 2012 budget and strategic road map.
The other key inputs in assessing each CGU are its revenue growth rate and discount rate.
The revenue growth rate has been applied to cash flows after four years 2010: three years into perpetuity and reflects published GDP growth rates for the economic environment of each CGU.
The cash flows assume a residual value based on a multiple of earnings before interest and tax.
The cash flows have been discounted using a pre-tax discount rate in the range of 10.3% to 13.4% 2010: 11.0% to 11.7%.
The discount rates are revised annually applying updated market inputs to the capital asset pricing model.

The major assumptions that result in significant sensitivities are the discount rate and the revenue growth rate.
Except as noted below, a reasonably possible change in a single assumption will not give rise to impairment in any of the Groups CGUs.
The Balfour Beatty Capital US goodwill is 43m and the key assumption is the discount rate of 10.3%, at which the fair value of the CGU exceeds the carrying value by 49m or 25%.
The fair value is equal to the carrying value at a discount rate of 11.9%.
The Rail Power Systems Europe goodwill is 165m and the key assumption is the revenue growth rate of 2.5%, at which the fair value of the CGU exceeds the carrying value by 26m or 10%.
The fair value is equal to the carrying value at a revenue growth rate of 1.5%.

The Groups financial risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effect of these risks on the Groups financial performance.
Financial risk management is carried out centrally by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board.
Group Treasury liaises with the Groups operating companies to identify, evaluate and hedge financial risks.
The Board provides written principles for overall financial risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposure limits is monitored through the Groups internal audit and risk management procedures.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
a Market risk The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The Group enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate, foreign currency and commodity price risk, including: forward foreign exchange contracts and options to hedge the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities transacted in a currency that is not the functional currency of the operating company: commodity forward contracts to manage the commodity price risk associated with the Groups operational requirements for certain commodities, such as fuel: and interest rate swaps to mitigate the cash flow variability associated with variable interest rates on borrowings in PPP concessions.
There has been no material change to the Groups exposure to market risks and there has been no change in how the Group manages those risks since 2010. i Foreign currency risk management The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from exposure to various currencies, primarily to US dollars, euros, Australian dollars, Hong Kong dollars and United Arab Emirate dirhams.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future trading transactions, assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
Group policy requires operating companies to manage their transactional foreign exchange risk against their functional currency.
Group Treasury enters into forward contracts on behalf of operating companies to cover 100% of foreign exchange risk above pre-set materiality levels determined by the Chief Financial Officer whenever a current or future foreign currency exposure is identified with sufficient reliability.
Hedge accounting is applied to these transactions.
Details of forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding at the reporting date in respect of foreign currency transactional exposures are set out on page 124.
As at 31 December 2011, the notional principal amounts of foreign exchange contracts in respect of foreign currency transactions where hedge accounting is not applied was 116m 2010: 151m.
The period during which the cash flows are expected to occur is up to three years.
This will affect the income statement throughout the same periods.
The Group has designated forward exchange contracts against highly probable capital expenditure which is expected to occur in up to three years with a notional principal amount of 26m 2010: 23m as cash flow hedges.
Fair value gains of nil 2010: 2m gains have been taken to hedging reserves within equity in relation to these contracts.
The cumulative amounts deferred in the hedging reserves relating to cash flow hedges at year-end is nil 2010: 2m.
The Groups investments in foreign operations are exposed to foreign currency translation risks.
These were previously managed by hedging significant net assets denominated in currencies other than sterling principally using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policy was amended in prior years and the Group currently no longer enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated assets.
There has been no change to the hedging policies since 2010.
The hedging policy is reviewed periodically.
No significant amounts in relation to hedge ineffectiveness have been charged or credited to the income statement in relation to any foreign exchange cash flow hedges.

Floating rate borrowings expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Group policy is to swap floating rate interest to fixed rate, usinginterest rate swaps, to hedge the cash flow variability of the interest.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the applicable yield curve at the reporting date.
The net effect of a movement in interest rates on income would therefore be immaterial.
During 2011 and 2010, the Groups PPP subsidiaries borrowings at variable rates of interest were denominated in sterling.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding PPP subsidiaries interest rate swaps outstanding at 31 December 2011 were 365m 2010: 297m with maturities that match the maturity of the underlying borrowings ranging from one year to 25 years.
At 31 December 2011, the fixed interest rates range from 4.2% to 5.1% 2010: 4.5% to 5.1% and the principal floating rates are LIBOR plus a fixed margin.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 19m 2010: 6m increase and a 21m 2010: 6m decrease in amounts taken directly by the Group to equity in relation to the Groups exposure to interest rates on the available-for-sale financial assets and cash flow hedges of its PPP subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk also arises on the Groups cash and cash equivalents, term deposits and non-PPP borrowings.
A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which these financial instruments are held would lead to a 1m 2010: 3m increase and a nil 2010: 3m decrease in the Groups net investment income.
iii Price risk management The Groups principal price risk exposure arises in its PPP concessions.
At the commencement of the concession an element of the unitary payment by the client is indexed to offset the effect of inflation on the concessions costs.
To the extent that inflation differs from the index used, the Group is exposed to a price risk.
b Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations, resulting in financial loss.
Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions.
The Group has a policy of assessing the creditworthiness of potential customers before entering into transactions.
For cash and cash equivalents and derivative financial instruments the Group has a policy of only depositing funds with independently rated counterparties with a minimum long-term credit rating of A.
At 31 December 2011 32m 2010: 37m did not meet this criterion due to the operational and relationship difficulties in transferring certain balances.
No losses are anticipated from non-performance of these counterparties.
The credit rating of a financial institution will determine the amount and duration for which funds may be deposited under individual risk limits set by the Board for the Group and subsidiary companies.
Management monitors the utilisation of these credit limits regularly.
For trade and other receivables credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable using independent ratings where available or by assessment of the customers credit quality based on its financial position, past experience and other factors.
TheGroups most significant customers are public or quasi-public sector entities which generally have high credit ratings or are of a high credit quality due to the nature of the customer.
The maximum exposure to credit risk in respect of the above at 31 December is the carrying value of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowance for losses.
c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash balances and banking facilities, continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Details of undrawn committed borrowing facilities are set out in Note 24.1.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out on page 125.
Balfour Beatty Annual report and accounts 2011 127 Our accounts Notes to the accounts continued 21 Financial instruments continued 21.2 Group continued Fair value estimation The Group holds a number of financial instruments on the statement of financial position at their fair values.
The following hierarchy classifies each class of financial asset or liability depending on the valuation technique applied in determining its fair value.
Level 1 The fair value is calculated based on quoted prices traded in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
The Group holds available-for-sale investments in mutual funds which are traded in active markets and valued based on the closing market price at 31December.
Level 2 The fair value is based on inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows utilising applicable year-end yield curves.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates atthe reporting date and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching the maturities of the foreign exchange contracts.
Level 3 The fair value is based on unobservable inputs.
The fair value of the Groups PPP financial assets is determined in the construction phase by applying an attributable profit margin that reflects the fair value of construction services performed.
In the operational phase it is determined by discounting the future cash flows allocated to the financial asset at a discount rate which is based on long-term gilt rates adjusted for the risk levels associated with the assets.
The subsequent movement in the fair value is taken to equity.
There have been no transfers between these categories in the current or preceding year.

Refer to Note 18 for a reconciliation of the movement of the opening balance to the closing balance.
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade and other receivables and payables approximate their fair values due to their short-term nature.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar financial instruments.

The Companys external forward foreign exchange contracts hedge the currency risk on foreign currency loans entered into with Group companies or are offset by forward foreign exchange contracts with the Groups operating companies where Group Treasury is hedging the exchange rate risk arising on trading activities on their behalf.
ii Interest rate risk management A 50 basis point increase decrease in the interest rate of each currency in which financial instruments are held would lead to a 5m 2010: 3m decrease increase in the Companys investment income.
This is mainly attributable to the Companys exposure to UK interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and term deposits and amounts due to and from its subsidiaries.
There would be no effect on amounts taken directly by the Company to equity.
b Credit risk The Company bears credit risk in respect to trade receivables and payables due from to subsidiaries.
There were no amounts past due atthe reporting date.
The maximum exposure is the carrying value of the financial assets recorded in the financial statements.

The effect of the reduction in the UK tax rate reduced the Groups net deferred tax asset by 6m with 2m being charged to the income statement and 4m being charged to equity.
In the 2011 Budget it was announced, although not enacted, that there will be a further 1% reduction in the main corporation tax rate in each of the two subsequent years to bring the rate down to 23% from 1 April 2014.
Should the future UK corporation tax rate reductions be enacted, based on the latest forecasts, this will give rise to a further reduction in the Groups net deferred tax asset of 6m by 2014 with 2m being charged to the income statement and 4m being charged to reserves.
At the reporting date, the Group had unused tax losses that arose over a number of years of approximately 273m 2010: 240m which are available for offset against future profits.
26m 2010: 31m will expire 20 years after the year in which they arose, using losses incurred in earlier years before those incurred in later years, with the first expiry in 2021.
The remaining losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the reporting date, the undistributed reserves of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 924m 2010: 850m and for joint ventures and associates was 110m 2010: 95m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because either no temporary difference arises or the timing of any distribution is under the Groups control and no distribution which gives rise to taxation is contemplated.

Defined contribution schemes are those where the Groups obligation is limited to the amount that it contributes to the scheme and the scheme members bear the investment and actuarial risks.
Defined benefit schemes are schemes other than defined contribution schemes and provide benefits based on employees pensionable service and their pensionable salary.
The majority of the Groups defined benefit schemes are funded.
Defined benefit contributions are determined in consultation with the trustees, after taking actuarial advice.
The Groups main scheme is the Balfour Beatty Pension Fund BBPF, which includes defined contribution and defined benefit sections.
The defined benefit sections are closed to new members with the exception of employees transferring under certain agreed arrangements.
On 21 December 2011, the BBPF acquired the Groups effective 25.5% interest in Barking Power Ltd at its carrying value of 55m.
During the year ended 31 December 2011 the Group made a pension increase exchange PIE offer to certain current pensioners, widows and widowers of the BBPF to forego their entitlement to future non-statutory inflationary increases in return for a higher pension than their current entitlement.
At 31 December 2011, 509 members had accepted the PIE offer, resulting in a 2m reduction in liabilities and a consequential past service cost credit of 2m.
During the year ended 31 December 2010 the Group offered certain deferred members of the BBPF enhanced benefits to leave the BBPF and transfer to a freestanding defined contribution scheme.
1,641 deferred members took up the option of the enhanced benefits, resulting in a 42m reduction in assets, a 50m reduction in liabilities and a settlement gain of 8m.
A net gain of 2m was recognised after payments of 6m of enhancements and other expenses.
A formal funding valuation of the BBPF was carried out as at 31 March 2010.
As a result of the funding valuation the Group agreed to an additional one-off deficit funding contribution of 40m, paid in December 2010, and to increase the amount of ongoing deficit payments to the BBPF to 48m per annum from April 2010, increasing each year by CPI capped at 5% plus 50% of any increase in the Companys dividend in excess of capped CPI.
A further one-off deficit funding contribution of 55m was made in December 2011.
The investment strategy of the BBPF is to hold assets of appropriate liquidity and marketability to generate income and capital growth tomeet, together with any contributions from the Group, the cost of current and future benefits.
The BBPF invests partly in a diversified range of assets including equities and hedge funds in anticipation that, over the longer term, they will grow in value faster than the liabilities.
The equities are in the form of pooled funds and are a combination of UK, other developed market and emerging market equities.
The remaining BBPF assets are principally fixed and index-linked bonds and swaps in order to match the duration and inflation exposure of the liabilities and enhance the resilience of the funding level of the scheme.
The performance of the assets is measured against market indices.

The economic interest of the Group in this shared cost scheme is approximately 60% of the schemes assets and liabilities, based on the relevant provisions of the trust deed and rules and trustee guidelines regarding future surplus apportionments and deficit financing.
Parsons Brinckerhoff Ltd operates a defined benefit scheme, which is closed to new members Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme.
TheParsons Brinckerhoff Scheme has a legal charge over a Group leasehold property with a book value of 4m 2010: 4m.
With the exception of the Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme, active members continue to accrue benefits for future service.
Other schemes comprise funded and unfunded post-retirement benefit obligations in Europe and North America, the majority of which are closed to newentrants, and deferred compensation schemes in the US, where an element of employees compensation is deferred and invested in available-for-sale assets as disclosed in Note 17.1 for the ultimate benefit of the employees in a trust, the assets of which are available tothe Groups creditors in the event of insolvency.
On 30 November 2010 the UK Government published the Occupational Pensions Revaluation Order 2010 which, with effect from 1January 2011, changed the basis of UK general statutory pension indexation from the retail prices index RPI to the consumer prices index CPI.
The benefits of certain members of the Groups schemes are defined by reference to the statutory measure of inflation rather than being specifically linked by the scheme rules to RPI.
In the year ended 31 December 2011, the Group reassessed the difference between the RPI and CPI measures of price inflation from 0.50% to 0.90%.
The increase was applied following consideration of research published by the Office for National Statistics and independent advice received from the Groups actuaries.
These changes in assumptions gave rise to a 35m 2010: 52m actuarial reduction in liabilities which is credited to equity in the statement of comprehensive income.

Obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method and discounted to a net present value using the market yield on a high-quality corporate bond.
The pension expense relating to current service cost is charged to contracts or overheads based on the function of scheme members and is included in cost of sales and net operating expenses.
The net finance cost arising from the expected return on plan assets and the interest on scheme obligations is included in finance charges.
Actuarial gains and losses are reported in full in the statement of comprehensive income.
The IAS 19 accounting valuation is set out in 26.2.
A different calculation is used for the regular valuations undertaken by the scheme trustees to determine the future company contribution level necessary so that over time the scheme assets will meet the scheme liabilities.
The principal difference between the two methods is that under the funding basis the liabilities are discounted using a rate of return reflecting the composition of the assets in the scheme, rather than the rate of return on a high-quality corporate bond as required by IAS 19 for the financial statements.
Details of the latest formal funding basis valuations are set out in 26.3.
The assets of the schemes do not include any direct holdings of the Groups financial instruments, nor any property occupied by, or other assets of the Group.
The Parsons Brinckerhoff Scheme has an interest in a property under an operating lease that is occupied under an operating sublease by a Group company which pays an annual rental of 0.2m 2010: 0.2m.

During the current and prior year, no preference shares were repurchased for cancellation by the Company.
Holders of preference shares are entitled to a preferential dividend equivalent to a gross payment of 10.75p per preference share per annum, payable half-yearly.
Any preference shares still outstanding are redeemable on 1 July 2020 at 1 each, together with any arrears or accruals of dividend, unless the holder exercises any option granted by the Company to extend the redemption date.
The maximum redemption value of all of the issued and outstanding preference shares, excluding any arrears or accruals of dividend, was 112m at 31 December 2011 2010: 112m.
At the option of the holder, preference shares are convertible on the first day of the next calendar month following receipt of the conversion notice into new Balfour Beatty plc ordinary shares effectively on the basis of 24.69136 ordinary shares for every 100 preference shares, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.
The Company is entitled to convert all outstanding preference shares into ordinary shares if there are fewer than 44,281,239 preference shares in issue or if the average of the closing mid-market price for aBalfour Beatty plc ordinary share during a 30-day period exceeds 810p, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.

The preference shares are a compound instrument, comprising an equity and a liability component.
The fair value of the liability component at the date of issue, included under non-current liabilities, was estimated using the prevailing market interest rate of 13.5% for a similar non-convertible instrument.
The difference between the proceeds of issue of the preference shares and the fair value assigned to the liability component, representing the value of the equity conversion component, is included in equity holders equity, netof deferred tax.

Balfour Beatty Annual report and accounts 2011 157 Our accounts Notes to the accounts continued 37 Principal subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates continued e Balfour Beatty Capital US PPP concessions Military housing Summary Balfour Beatty through its subsidiary Balfour Beatty Communities LLC is a manager, developer, and investor in a number ofUS military privatisation projects associated with a total of 43 military bases which includes 43 military family housing communities and one unaccompanied personnel housing community that provide speciality housing to US military personnel and their families.
Project descriptions The projects comprise 11 military family housing privatisation projects with the United States Department of the Army Army, covering 16 Army bases: four projects with the United States Department of the Air Force Air Force, covering nine Air Force bases and two projects with the United States Department of the Navy Navy, covering 18 Navy bases.
In addition, there is one unaccompanied personnel housing UPH project at Fort Stewart, located in Hinesville, Georgia.
These projects in operation cover 43 domestic bases located in 21 states and Washington, DC and Balfour Beatty Communities expects them to contain approximately 33,000 end-state housing units once full development, construction and renovation have been completed.
The first phase of the project, known as the initial development period, covers the period of initial construction or renovation of military housing on a base, typically lasting three to eight years.
For each project, Balfour Beatty Communities creates a special purpose entity to serve as the owner of theproject, which is typically either a limited liability company or general partnership.
With respect to Army and Navy projects, the government becomes a member or partner of the project entity Project LLC : and, whereas the Air Force is not a named partner or member in Balfour Beatty Communities Project LLCs, it contributes a commitment to provide a government direct loan to the Project LLC and has similar rights to share in distributions and cash flows of the Project LLC.
Contractual arrangements On each project, the Project LLC enters into a ground lease with the government, which provides the Project LLC with a leasehold interest in the land and title to the improvements on the land for a period of 50 years.
Each of these military housing privatisation projects includes agreements covering the management, renovation, and development of existing housing units, aswell as the development, construction, renovation and management of new units during the term of the project, which, in the case of the Army, potentially could extend for up to an additional 25 years.
The 50-year duration of each project calls for continuous renovation, rehabilitation, demolition and reconstruction of housing units.
At the end of the ground lease term the Project LLCs leasehold interest terminates and all project improvements on the land generally transfer to the US Government.
Preferred returns The projects will typically receive, to the extent that adequate funds are available, an annual, minimum preferred rateof return.
On most existing projects, this annual minimum preferred rate of return ranges from 9% to 12% of Balfour Beatty Communities initial equity contribution to the project.
During the initial development period, the project is precluded from distributing funds to pay the minimum preferred rate of return.
The unpaid amounts generally will accrue and accumulate, and can be used to fund renovation and construction costs, if necessary.
If the accumulated funds are not needed to fund renovation and construction costs, at the end of the initial development period they are distributed to pay accrued preferred returns to Balfour Beatty Communities and the USGovernment in accordance with the terms of the project agreements.
Allocation of remaining operating cash flows Subsequent to the initial development period, any operating cash flow remaining after the annual minimum preferred rate of return is paid is shared between Balfour Beatty Communities and the reinvestment account held bythe project for the benefit of the US Government.
On most of the existing projects, the total amount that Balfour Beatty Communities is entitled to receive inclusive of the preferred return is generally capped at an annual modified rate of return, or cash-on-cash return, onits initial equity contribution to the project.
Historically, these caps have ranged between approximately 9% to 18% depending on the particular project and the type of return annual modified rates of return or cash-on-cash.
However, in some of the more recent projects, there are either no annual caps or lower projected annual rates of return.
The total capped return generally will include the annual minimum preferred return discussed above.
The reinvestment account is an account established for the benefit of the military, but funds may be withdrawn for construction, development and renovation costs during the remaining life of a privatisation project upon approval by the applicable military branch.
Return of equity Generally, at the end of a project term, any monies remaining in the reinvestment account are distributed to Balfour Beatty Communities and the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable, in a predetermined order of priority.
Typically these distributions willhave the effect of providing the parties with sufficient funds to provide a minimum annual return over the life of the project and acomplete return of the initial capital contribution.
After payment of the minimum annual return and the return of a partys initial contribution, all remaining funds will typically be distributed to the Army, Navy or Air Force, as applicable.
