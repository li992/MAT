Financial Statements 80 Notes to the financial statements 1 GENERAL INFORMATION Thomas Cook Group plc is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The address of the registered of ce is 6th Floor South, Brettenham House, Lancaster Place, London, WC2E 7EN.
The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Directors Report Business Review on pages 2 to 39.
These consolidated financial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 13 December 2011.
2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to groups reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation of certain financial instruments, investment property, share-based payments and fide ned bene t pension obligations.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial information presented in this document are set out below.
These policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation Adoption of new or amended standards and interpretations in the current year In the current year, the following new or amended standards have been adopted.
Their adoption has not had a signi cant impact on the amounts reported or the disclosure and presentation in these financial statements, but may impact the accounting or the disclosure and presentation for future transactions and arrangements.
IFRS2 Amendment Share-based payments is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010.
This amendment clari es the scope and accounting for group cash-settled share-based payments.
New or amended standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are expected to impact the Group, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue, but are not yet effective: IAS 24 Amendment Related parties is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.
The amendment clari es the fide nition of related parties.
IFRIC 14 Amendment Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011.
The amendment remedies one of the consequences of IFRIC 14, whereby an entity under certain circumstances is not allowed to recognise an asset for the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement.
Management does not anticipate that the adoption of these new or amended standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Group.
New or amended standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective and not EU endorsed The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are expected to impact the Group, which have not been applied in these financial statements, were in issue, but are not yet effective and are not EU endorsed: IFRS 9 Financial Instruments is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013.
The standard will eventually replace IAS 39 but currently only details the requirements for recognition and measurement of financial assets.
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard builds on existing principles by identifying the concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity should be included within consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 11 Joint arrangements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard provides for a more realistic re ection of joint arrangements by focusing on the rights and obligations of the arrangement, rather than its legal form.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interests in other entities is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard includes the disclosure requirements for all forms of interests in other entities, including joint arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles and other off balance sheet vehicles.
IAS 19 revised 2011 Emplo yee bene ts is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This amendment makes signi cant changes to the recognition and measurement of fide ned bene t pension expense and termination bene ts, and to the disclosures for all employee bene ts.
Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 81 IAS 27 revised Separate financial statements is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard includes the provisions on separate financial statements that are left after the control provisions of IAS 27 have been included in the new IFRS 10.
IAS 28 revised Investments in associa tes and joint ventures is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013.
This standard includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as associates, to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11.
Management is currently assessing the impact of adopting these new or amended standards and interpretations.
Basis of consolidation The Groups financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired, or disposed of, are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method.
Where a transaction is a business combination amongst entities under common control, the requirements of IFRS 3 R are applied.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, contingent consideration arrangements entered into, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Identi able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date.
When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100%, the non-controlling interest is measured as the proportion of the recognised net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of identi able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Where audited financial accounts are not coterminous with those of the Group, the financial information is derived from the last audited accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Companys balance sheet date.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 Consolidation special purpose entities, indicates that certain special purpose entities SPEs, which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
As a consequence, the Group has consolidated three 2010: three SPEs that own four 2010: four aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases.
In addition, during 2009 the operations of the German airline were placed in a holding company in which the Group owns a 50.0023% direct interest.
All risks and rewards continue to be held by the Group and, in accordance with accounting standards, the entity has been treated as being 100% controlled and fully consolidated by the Group.
Associates and joint ventures Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts signi cant in uence, but not control or joint control, are associates.
Entities which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Groups share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity accounting method.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the Group balance sheet at cost, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the entity, and including any goodwill identi ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment loss.
When the Groups shares of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate or joint venture.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the associates.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset, and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the Groups income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identi able cash ows cash-generating units.
The allocation of goodwill is made to those cash-generating units that are expected to bene t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose.
The Group allocates goodwill to each segment in which it operates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the pro t or loss on disposal.
Financial Statements 82 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Intangible assets other Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Groups balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are not amortised.
For all other intangible assets, amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the assets useful life, as follows: Brands 10 years to inde nite life Customer relationships 1 to 15 years Computer software 3 to 10 years Other acquired intangible assets are assessed separately and useful lives established according to the particular circumstances.
Inde nite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash in ows.
These are considered to have an inde nite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Intangible assets with inde nite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually at the CGU level by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable amount.
All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment.
If such indications exist, the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Except for investment property, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are included within the cost of the item.
Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight-line basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years Aircraft 18 years or remaining lease period if shorter Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years or remaining lease period if shorter Other xed assets 3 to 15 years Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth.
It is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Investment property is valued annually by external quali ed professional valuers in the countries concerned.
In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal valuation is performed and adjustments made to re ect any material changes in fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale The Group classi es non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
To be classi ed as held for sale, the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, and their sale must be highly probable.
Sale is considered to be highly probable when management is committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has been initiated at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed within one year from the date of classi cation.
Non-current assets classi ed as held for sale are carried on the Groups balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 83 Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs The cost of major overhauls of owned and finance leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes is capitalised and then amortised over between two and ten years until the next scheduled major overhaul, except where the maintenance of engines and auxiliary power units is carried out under xed rate contracts, in which case the cost is spread over the period of the contract.
Provision is made for the future costs of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, calculated by reference to hours own and or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms of certain operating leases.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Revenue recognition and associated costs Revenue represents the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, travel agency commissions receivable and other services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business.
Revenue and direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Groups leisure travel providers, including travel agency commission, insurance and other incentives, are taken to the income statement on holiday departure.
Revenue relating to travel agency commission on third-party leisure travel products is also recognised on holiday departure.
The costs attributable to producing brochures are expensed when the brochures are available to be sent to customers or retail outlets.
Other revenue and associated expenses are taken to the income statement as earned or incurred.
Revenue and expenses exclude intra-group transactions.
Income statement presentation and separately disclosed items Pro t or loss from operations includes the results from operating activities of the Group, before its share of the results of associates and joint ventures.
The Group separately discloses in the income statement: exceptional items: amortisation of business combination intangibles: and IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
Exceptional items, namely items that are material either because of their size or their nature, and which are non-recurring, are presented within their relevant income statement category, but highlighted through separate disclosure.
The separate reporting of exceptional items helps provide a full understanding of the Groups underlying performance.
Items which are included within the exceptional category include: pro ts losses on disposal of assets or businesses and costs of acquisitions: costs of integration of signi cant acquisitions and other major restructuring programmes: signi cant goodwill or other asset impairments: material write-down of assets reassessment of accruals, re ecting a more cautious evaluation in the light of current trading and economic conditions excluding errors or prior year items : other individually material items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc and other business combinations made in subsequent years.
The amortisation of these intangible assets is signi cant and the Groups management consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Groups results.
IAS 39 fair value re-measurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options in cash ow hedging relationships.
Both items are subject to market uctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts mature and therefore are not considered to be part of the Groups underlying performance.
Financial Statements 84 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Finance income and costs Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets and changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives.
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and finance leases, unwind of the discount on provisions, interest cost on pension plan liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and the movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ow hedging relationships.
The movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ow hedging relationships is included as a separately disclosed item in the income statement under the description IAS 39 fair value re-measurement.
Tax Tax represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Tax currently payable is provided on taxable pro ts based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax so as to recognise all temporary differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future, except as set out below.
This is calculated on a non-discounted basis by reference to the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the relevant jurisdictions and for the periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect either accounting or taxable pro t or loss.
Deferred tax assets are assessed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that their recovery against future taxable pro ts is probable.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for the temporary differences of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates unless the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution of those earnings and it is probable that they will not be distributed in the foreseeable future.
Pensions Pension costs charged against pro ts in respect of the Groups fide ned contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
The Group also operates a number of fide ned bene t schemes.
The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Groups obligations under the schemes calculated using the projected unit credit method and the fair value of those schemes assets.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The current service cost, representing bene ts accruing over the year, is included in the income statement as a personnel expense.
The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme assets are presented as finance costs and finance income respectively.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement in personnel expenses.
Foreign currency Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other than Sterling.
The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange differences are recorded through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the period end are translated at period end exchange rates.
The resulting exchange gain or loss is recorded in the income statement.
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 85 Leases Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are finance leases.
All other leases are operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives.
The interest element of finance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowing costs The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets requiring a substantial amount of time to be ready for the intended purpose.
Derivative financial instruments Derivatives are recognised at their fair value.
When a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting as a cash ow hedge, changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a derivative quali es for hedge accounting as a cash ow hedge, changes in fair value that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
Forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options are not designated as part of the hedging relationship and therefore are recorded in the income statement within finance costs and costs of providing tourism respectively.
Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative in a cash ow hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement within net operating expenses.
For cash ow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period, or periods, during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
Non-derivative financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets are derecognised when the Group transfers the financial asset or when the contractual rights expire.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires.
The measurement of particular financial assets and liabilities is set out below: Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of allowance is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ows.
Available-for-sale financial assets Available-for-sale financial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses except for impairment losses and foreign exchange gains and losses are recognised directly in equity until the financial asset is derecognised.
At this point, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments Short-term investments are classi ed as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value.
Gains or losses are recognised in the income statement.
Financial Statements 86 Notes to the financial statements continued 2 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Other non-current asset investments The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an appropriate valuation technique.
Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Borrowings Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs.
They are subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an out ow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are recognised at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value.
Termination bene ts Termination bene ts are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these bene ts.
The Group recognises termination bene ts when it is demonstrably committed to: either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination bene ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration.
The fair values of the share options are calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model.
These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between the booked premiums for prior years and those previously accrued, less cancellations.
Premiums are recognised as revenue earned premiums proportionally over the period of coverage.
Premiums are shown after the deduction of commission and premium taxes where relevant.
Claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred based on the estimated liability for compensation owed to policyholders or third parties damaged by policyholders.
The Group does not discount its liabilities for unpaid claims.
Liabilities for unpaid claims are estimated using the input of assessments for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred but not reported.
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers, under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the Group, and that meet the classi cation requirements for insurance contracts, are classi ed as reinsurance contracts held.
The bene ts to which the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as receivables from reinsurers.
The Group assesses its reinsurance assets for impairment on an annual basis.
Receivables and payables are recognised when due.
These include amounts due to and from insurance policyholders.
Critical judgements in applying the Groups accounting policies In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, described above, management has made the following judgements that have the most signi cant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 87 Residual values of tangible xed assets Judgements have been made in respect of the residual values and useful economic lives of aircraft included in property, plant and equipment.
Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash ows to be generated by certain of the Groups businesses in order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an inde nite life in relation to those businesses.
Special purpose entities The nature of the relationship with certain special purpose entities involved in leasing aircraft to the Group shows that they should be interpreted as controlled by the Group, and therefore consolidated, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signi cant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below: Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with an inde nite life Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with an inde nite life are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash ows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft eet.
Tax The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex.
It can take several years for tax liabilities to be agreed with the relevant authorities.
Tax assets and liabilities represent managements estimates of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the future and may be dependent on estimates of future pro tability.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised as a result.
The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of future pro tability.
Retirement bene ts The consolidated financial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement bene t obligations.
The costs and the present value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities.
The Group uses previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates.
The estimates, and the effect of variances in key estimates, are disclosed in note 35.
3 SEGMENTAL INFORMATION For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into six geographic operating divisions: UK, Central Europe, West & East Europe, Northern Europe, North America and Airlines Germany.
These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
Certain residual businesses and corporate functions are not allocated to these divisions and are shown separately as Corporate.
These reportable segments are consistent with how information is presented to the Group Chief Executive chief operating decision maker for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of performance.
The primary business of all of these operating divisions is the provision of leisure travel services and, accordingly, no separate secondary segmental information is provided.

Financial Statements 92 Notes to the financial statements continued 5 SEPARATELY DISCLOSED ITEMS CONTINUED During the year the Group recognised impairment losses on goodwill totalling 278.7m in relation to its UK, North America and India segments to re ect a decrease in the likely future pro tability and cash ows of those businesses.
The Group also wrote down the carrying value of purchased and internally generated computer software, giving rise to an impairment loss of 83.9m.
Details of these impairments are disclosed in note 12.
The 86.3m above also includes 2.4m for the recognition of provisions for onerous contracts in respect of the impaired assets.
The 63.1m relates to UK and France balance sheet reviews which were carried out following management changes in our UK business and the substantial deterioration of trading within our French operation.
The review of the UK balance sheet identi ed several areas where recovery of the carrying value of assets was no longer considered achievable or where recognition of additional liabilities was considered appropriate.
The overall impact of this reassessment was 49.7m.
Deterioration of trading and a change of management in our French business led to the reassessment of certain assets and liabilities that had been recognised at the previous year end.
It is now considered that certain accounting judgements regarding collectability of assets and recognition of liabilities were incorrect.
Revision of these accounting judgements has resulted in a charge totalling 13.4m in the year.
The 10.3m pro t on disposal of associates relates to the disposal by Central Europe of minority stakes in two hotel management companies, as disclosed in note 14.
Other exceptional interest charges include interest incurred upon recognition of the provision for HMRC settlement and other adjustments to interest arising as a result of the balance sheet reviews.

In accordance with accounting standards, the Group tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or circumstances change.
Impairment testing is performed by comparing the carrying value of each cash-generating unit CGU to the recoverable amount, determined on the basis of the CGUs value in use.
The value in use is based on the net present value of future cash ow projections discounted at pre-tax rates appropriate for each CGU.
The Groups CGUs are determined by geographical market and consist of UK, India, Egypt, Central Europe, West & East Europe, Northern Europe, North America and Airlines Germany.
The value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on the most recent annual budgets and three-year plans for each of the CGUs.
In determining these projections the Board has approved budgets which they consider to be prudent and re ect the trading environment in which each CGU operates.
Cash ow forecasts for years beyond the three-year plan are extrapolated at an estimated average long-term nominal growth rate.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are as follows: a pre-tax discount rate of between 9.2% and 11.1% re ecting the speci c risks of each CGU a long-term nominal terminal growth rate of 2% for all CGUs with the exception of Egypt 5% As a result of the value in use calculations performed at 30 September 2011, an impairment charge of 278.7m 2010: nil was booked against the carrying value of the Groups goodwill.
The impairment losses were recognised within operating expenses in the Groups income statement.
A breakdown of the impairment charge is presented below.
Management believes the assumptions applied in each test were prudent and appropriate for that CGU.
However, any sensitivity to these assumptions would result in a change to the recoverable amount.

Concessions include the value of licences granted to the Group, as well as copyrights and trademarks and similar items.
Licences are amortised over the period of the licence, up to a maximum of ten years.
Other items are amortised over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
The impairment loss of 83.4m in respect of purchased computer software and concessions is principally in respect of the historic costs associated with a long running major IT project that has yet to be fully commissioned by the Groups incumbent provider.
The Directors consider that the costs, execution risks and timeframe to delivery exceed the previously anticipated bene ts.
As required by accounting standards, a review of the recoverable amount was performed on a fair value less cost to sell basis and was determined by reference to its value in an active market taking into account the customised nature of the assets.
The impairment loss was booked against other intangible assets and recognised within operating expenses in the Groups income statement against the UK and Corporate reporting segments.
The net book value of aircraft and aircraft spares includes 123.8m 2010: 111.8m in respect of assets held under finance leases.
The net book value of other property, plant and equipment includes 12.7m 2010: 14.1m in respect of assets held under finance leases.
The investment property was revalued on the basis of market value by 1m in September 2011.
This followed an external professional valuation performed in the Netherlands.
Market value represents the gure that would appear in a hypothetical contract of sale between a willing buyer and a willing seller.

Changes to the prior period acquisitions Think W3 Ltd During the year the fair value adjustments relating to the Think W3 Ltd trading as Essential Travel acquisition were amended.
The Directors do not consider the amendments to be material to the Group.
Consequently the prior year comparatives have not been restated as required by IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations.
Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 105 Had the prior year comparatives been restated the fair value amendments would have had the following impact as at the date of acquisition 30 April 2010 and as at 30 September 2010: At At date of 30 September acquisition 2010 m m Balance sheet Intangible assets: Decrease in goodwill 0.7 0.7 Increase in business combination intangibles 1.0 1.0 Increase in deferred tax liability 0.3 0.3 Hotels4U.

No interest is charged on the receivables.
The credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided.
In the case of travel services sold by third-party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those supplies.
The Groups current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance.
There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods.
Deposits and prepayments also include 41.8m 2010: 47.5m of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements which are primarily attributable to the UK airline.
Securities include money market securities amounting to 2.3m 2010: 2.7m purchased as collateral against liabilities arising from part-time retirement contracts at Thomas Cook AG, which are classi ed as available-for-sale financial assets.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identi ed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based on local management experience.
Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local trading conditions.
Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector.
The Directors do not consider there to be signi cant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

Trade and other payables include nonfinancial liabilities of 218.3m 2010: 208.2m which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, derivatives with a positive fair value and trade and other receivables.
The maximum exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is their carrying value.
The Group assesses its counterparty exposure in relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts and undrawn credit facilities.
The Group uses published credit ratings, credit default swap prices and share price performance in the previous 30-day period to assess counterparty strength and therefore to fide ne the credit limit for each counterparty.
The Groups approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in note 17.
24 INSURANCE Management of insurance risk Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, issues contracts that transfer signi cant insurance risk and that are classi ed as insurance contracts.
As a general guideline, the Group fide fines as signi cant insurance risk the possibility of having to compensate the policyholder if a speci ed uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume.
Underwriting performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract.
Exposure is capped by speci c limits within the insurance policy and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits.
Commercial policies with the Group are subject to policy excesses and single event and aggregate limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Groups past development pattern.
This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments.
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate.
Any changes to these variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group financial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland Ltd Board of Directors which ensures that reinsurers have a financial stability rating of B A M Best or above.
The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the Groups exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances for financial reporting purposes: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax liabilities 120.9 88.2 Deferred tax assets 281.3 383.2 160.4 295.0 At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of 2,116.5m 2010: 1,820m available for offset against future pro ts.
Deferred tax assets have only been recognised where there is suf cient probability that there will be future taxable pro ts against which the assets may be recovered.
The decrease in recognised tax losses in the year relates to the review of the UK balance sheet which identi ed items whose recoverability is considered unlikely.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses of 1,427.3m 2010: 888.2m due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on properties acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised amounting to 229.0m 2010: 186.1m, also due to the unpredictability of future pro t streams.
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets where both items fell within the responsibility of the same tax authority.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end, without taking into consideration the offsetting balances within the same jurisdiction, are 292.6m and 132.2m respectively.
The March 2011 Budget Statement announced a proposed reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 27% to 26% from 1 April 2011 and a further reduction to 25% effective from 1 April 2012.
Finance Act 2011 included legislation con rming this rate change and the effect has been to reduce the deferred tax assets by 9.2m as at 30 September 2011 2010: 8.6m.
The Budget Statement alsoproposed a further reduction in the main rate of corporation tax in the UK, to be enacted at a rate of1% per year to 23% by 1 April 2014.
The overall effectof the further changes from 25% to 23%, if applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September 2011, would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately 14.2m.

35 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of fide ned contribution plans and fide ned bene t plans, with the fide ned bene t plans being both funded and unfunded.
The obligations arising from fide ned contribution plans are satis ed by contribution payments to both private and state-run insurance providers.
Unfunded fide ned bene t pension obligations Unfunded fide ned bene t pension obligations primarily relate to the Groups employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the Condor Group.
Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling 188.6m 2010: 205.6m were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor Group Condor Flugdienst GmbH, Condor Berlin GmbH and CF GmbH.
For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a company pension scheme.
The ight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their inight employment and the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension.
In both cases, the bene t commitment depended on the final salaries of the employees concerned prior to the termination of their inight employment final salary plan.
Employees who joined a Condor Group company from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those employees average salary plan.
The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional provisions.
In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classi ed as unfunded fide ned bene t obligations and classi ed as such in these financial statements.
The Condor Group fide ned bene t plans have been closed to new entrants with the exception of pilots since 2004.
There are additional unfunded fide ned bene t obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group and obligations in respect of past service for employees in Sweden.
The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement bene t obligations in the balance sheet.
Financial Statements 124 Notes to the financial statements continued 35 RETIREMENT BENEFIT SCHEMES CONTINUED The following weighted average actuarial assumptions were made for the purpose of determining the unfunded fide ned bene t obligations: 2011 2010 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.99% 4.70% Expected rate of salary increases 1.65% 1.93% Future pension increases 1.50% 1.69% The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck were used as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of the pension obligations at 30 September 2011.
These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 22.96 years for men and 27.55 years for women.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these fide ned bene t schemes are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Current service cost 11.2 8.1 Past service cost 0.3 Gain on settlements 2.4 Curtailment gain 2.0 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 11.3 11.4 Total included in income statement 20.4 17.5 Service costs, gains on settlement and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement bene t obligations has been included in finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses have been reported in the statement of comprehensive income.
Changes in the present value of unfunded pension obligations were as follows: 2011 2010 m m At beginning of year 239.1 208.9 Current service cost 11.2 8.1 Past service cost 0.3 Interest cost 11.3 11.4 Bene ts paid 6.1 6.2 Settlements 8.5 7.2 Curtailments 2.0 Actuarial gains losses 17.5 36.5 Exchange difference 2.0 10.4 At end of year 227.8 239.1 Funded fide ned bene t pension obligations The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK and employees in Norway and the Netherlands are provided through funded fide ned bene t schemes, where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds under the control of trustees.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of quali ed actuaries in each country.
The fair value of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement bene t obligations and the net difference reported as a pension asset or retirement bene t obligation as appropriate.
Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
Funded fide ned bene t pension obligations have been determined on the basis of assumptions relevant to each country.
The weighted averages of these were: 2011 2010 % % Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.13% 4.97% In ation rate 3.13% 3.20% Expected return on scheme assets 5.78% 6.07% Expected rate of salary increases 4.34% 4.68% Future pension increases 2.86% 3.20% Directors Report: Business Review Directors Report: Governance Financial Statements 125 The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan accounts for approximately 90% 2010: 97% of the total funded fide ned bene t obligations.
The mortality assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2011 are based on the PMA92 PFA92 tables with medium cohort improvements and a minimum future longevity improvement per year of 1%, adjusted for recent mortality experience.
The mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 65 of 22.7 years for men and 25.8 years for women.
On 31 March 2011, the UK fide ned bene t schemes closed to all active members and pension provision will now be through a fide ned contribution scheme.
The closure of the schemes resulted in a cessation of future pension bene t accrual and a consequent curtailment gain of 25.8m, which has been recognised in the income statement.
Amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of these fide ned bene t schemes are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Current service cost 10.0 16.2 Curtailment gain 25.8 Expected return on scheme assets 42.1 37.9 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 43.4 43.4 Total included in the income statement 14.5 21.7 Service costs and curtailment gains have been included in personnel expenses in the income statement and the unwinding of the discount rate of the expected retirement bene t obligations has been included in finance costs.

In line with that agreement, Thomas Cook UK committed to make additional quarterly payments totalling 105.6m through to June 2014.
During the year ended 30 September 2011, Thomas Cook UK paid four instalments totalling 21.0m in line with the recovery plan.
