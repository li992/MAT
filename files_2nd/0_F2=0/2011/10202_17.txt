Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2011 1 Segmental reporting In accordance with IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the Group has derived the information for its operating segments using the information used by its Chief Operating Decision Maker the Executive Committee.
Operating segments are consistent with those used in internal management reporting and the measure used by the Executive Committee is the adjusted operating pro t for the Group taken as a whole, as set out in note 4.
Resources are managed on a global basis and accordingly the Executive Committee does not measure costs or operating pro t by segment, and therefore the Group does not report operating pro t by segment.

The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011.
Accordingly the Companys pro t for this accounting period are taxed at an effective rate of 27.8% and will be taxed at 26% in the future.
In addition to the changes in rates of Corporation tax disclosed above a number of further changes to the UK Corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 UK Budget Statement.
Legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% from 1 April 2012 is expected to be included in the Finance Act 2011.
Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014.
None of these expected rate reductions had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, are not included in these financial statements.
It is expected that the effects of these changes will have an immaterial impact on the deferred tax liabilities currently recognised.

This credit does not result from the performance of the business in the period and has therefore been excluded in calculating Adjusted EPS.
2 Adjusted items comprise amortisation of acquired intangibles, share based compensation and exceptional costs.
Estimated tax relief on these items is as shown above.

The Group conducts annual impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill, based on the net present value on the recoverable amount of the CGU to which goodwill has been allocated.
It has been determined that the Group has three CGUs being the three geographical segments North America: Europe, Middle East, Latin America and Africa: and Asia Paci c. An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of the CGU with their recoverable amount, where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
The Group has carried out its annual impairment testing at 30 April each year.
Micro Focus International plc 52 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 2011 overview Consolidated fi financial statements and notes Business review Company fi financial statements and notes Management and governance Additional information 9 Goodwill continued The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on the value in use VIU calculations.
The determination of whether or not goodwill has been impaired requires an estimate to be made of the VIU of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
The VIU calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
In all cases the approved budget for the following financial year forms the basis for the cash ow projections for a CGU.
The cash ow projections in the three financial years following the budget year re ect managements expectation of the medium and long-term operating performance of the CGU and growth prospects in the CGUs market.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the VIU calculations are the discount rate applied, the long-term operating margin and the long-term growth rate of net operating cash ows.
In determining the key assumptions, management has taken into consideration the current economic climate, the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates, and the pressure this places on impairment calculations.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to each CGU represents a pre-tax rate that re ects market assessment of the time value of money at the balance sheet date and risks speci c to the CGU.
The discount rate applied to each CGUs operations was: 2011 2010 North America 16.7% 16.8% Europe, Middle East, Latin America and Africa 14.1% 15.1% Asia Paci c 15.2% 15.4% Long-term operating margin The long-term operating margin for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past operating margins are not indicative of future operating margins.
The long-term EBITDA margin applied to each CGU is 40.0% 2010: 42.5%.
Long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows The long-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed to be no greater than the long-term growth rate in the gross domestic product of the countries in which the CGU operates and were 2.0% 2010: 2.0%.
The long-term growth rate is applied consistently across all CGUs as: The businesses within the CGUs have similar trading characteristics: Future forecasts are considered to be similar across all CGUs: Business risks are considered to be the same across all CGUs: The Group is expected to have no net debt at 30 April 2012 and during the twelve months to 30 April 2012 all CGUs will be similarly impacted as the Group repays its bank loans.
Summary of results During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment, with no impairment charge resulting 2010: nil.
As the VIU calculation is most sensitive to a change in the long-term operating mode, the directors are of the opinion that it would take a systematic change to the market for long-term operating margins to fall to the level where an impairment would be required.
The directors consider that a reduction of 4.0% 2010: 4.0% in the absolute value of long-term Adjusted EBITDA margins across all CGUs would be the limit of what could be considered to be reasonably possible on the basis that the Groups cost base is exible and could quickly respond to market changes.
The Group is spread across a range of geographies and sectors and also offers customer cost saving solutions, which help to insulate it from more signi cant changes.
If the long-term margins used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 4.0% 2010: 4.0% lower in absolute terms than managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
If the operating margins remain in perpetuity at the current year levels then there would also not be any impairment charge.
The Group bases its estimate for the long-term pre tax discount rate on its weighted average cost of capital WACC using long-term market data and industry data to derive the appropriate inputs to the calculation.
The directors have assessed that a 2.0% 2010: 2.0% change in the absolute discount rate is the maximum change that could be considered as reasonably possible and this would represent a 15.0% 2010: 15.0% reduction in the assumption.
If the estimated pre-tax discount rates applied to the discounted cash ows of all CGUs were 2.0% 2010: 2.0% higher in absolute terms than the managements estimates, the Group would not have any impairment charge.
Micro Focus International plc 53 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2011 continued 9 Goodwill continued The Group considers that the long-term growth rates could change and that a 1.0% 2010: 1.0% change is reasonably possible.
If the absolute value of the long-term growth used in the VIU calculations for all CGUs were 1% lower than managements estimates, the Group would not have recognised any goodwill impairment charge.
The directors have considered combinations of a reduction in the long-term operating margins across all CGUs combined with a reasonably possible increase in the absolute discount rate and a reasonably possible decrease in the long-term growth rates and no impairment would occur in these scenarios.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA for each CGU is primarily based upon past performance adjusted as appropriate where management believes that past Adjusted EBITDA margins are not indicative of future Adjusted EBITDA margins.
The medium-term Adjusted EBITDA margins applied to each CGU is 40.0% 2010: 42.5%.
The medium-term growth rates of net operating cash ows are assumed to be 4.0% for each CGU 2010: 7.0%.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life see accounting policy 1H d. At 30 April 2011, the unamortised lives of technology assets were in the range of three to seven years and for customer relationships in the range of two to eight years.

In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers the ageing of each debtor and any change in the circumstances of the individual receivable.
Due to this, management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
At 30 April 2011 and 2010, the carrying amount approximates the fair value of the instrument due to the short-term nature of the instrument.
At 30 April 2011, trade receivables of $8.5 million 2010: $25.4 million were past due but not impaired.
These relate to a large number of independent companies for whom there is no recent history of default.
The amounts are regarded as recoverable.
The average age of these receivables was 42 days in excess of due date 2010: 38 days.
As at 30 April 2011, trade receivables of $4.4 million 2010: $2.2 million were either partially or fully impaired.
The amount of the provision was $4.4 million 2010: $2.2 million.
The ageing of these receivables in months overdue is as follows: 2011 2010 $000 $000 Three to four months 381 Over four months 4,035 2,225 Total 4,416 2,225 Movements in the Group provision for impairment of trade receivables were as follows: 2011 2010 $000 $000 At 1 May 2,225 1,593 Provision for receivables impairment 2,324 1,186 Acquisition of subsidiaries 696 Receivables written off as uncollectable 316 1,311 Exchange adjustments 183 61 At 30 April 4,416 2,225 The creation and release of provision for impaired receivables have been included in both selling and distribution costs and administrative expenses in the income statement.

20 Financial instruments Risk management The Groups treasury function aims to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available as and when required, and to invest cash assets safely and pro tably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments.
The treasury functions policies and procedures are reviewed and monitored by the audit committee and are subject to internal audit review.
Foreign exchange risk The Groups currency exposures comprise only those that give rise to net currency gains and losses to be recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures re ect the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
Note 3 shows the impact of foreign exchange losses in the year.
Micro Focus International plc 57 Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2011 continued 20 Financial instruments continued Capital risk management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and bene ts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, sell assets to reduce debt or repurchase shares.
In the year a repurchase of shares was undertaken as set out in note 23.
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings including current and non-current borrowings as shown in the consolidated balance sheet less cash and cash equivalents.
Total capital is calculated as equity, as shown in the consolidated balance sheet, plus net debt.

Incentive Plan 2005 On 27 April 2005 the remuneration committee approved the rules of the Incentive Plan 2005 LTIP which permits the granting of share options to executive directors and senior management.
The number of options received is determined by the performance criteria set by the Remuneration Committee over a three year performance period.
Prior to the 18 April 2011 performance conditions required that cumulative EPS growth over a three year period is at least equal to RPI plus 11% at which 25% of awards will vest, 60% of shares will vest for cumulative EPS growth of RPI plus 13% and for full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 15% per annum.
Straight line vesting will apply between these points.
Awards granted on or after 18 April 2011 are subject to either Absolute Shareholder Returns ASR over a three year period or a combination of cumulative EPS growth and ASR.
For the latter, where the cumulative EPS growth over a three year vesting period is at least equal to RPI plus 3% per annum at which 25% of awards will vest and full vesting the cumulative EPS growth will be required to be RPI plus 9% per annum.
The resulting level of vesting will be reduced by 25% if the ASR is below 150 pence or increased by 50% if ASR is 300 pence or more.
Further details are provided in the remuneration committee report.
