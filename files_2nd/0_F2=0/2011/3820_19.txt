Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 54 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 1 Authorisation of fi financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRS The consolidated fi financial statements of Computacenter plc for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 12 March 2012.
The balance sheet was signed on behalf of the Board by MJ Norris and FA Conophy.
Computacenter plc is a limited company incorporated and domiciled in England whose shares are publicly traded.
The Groups fi financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, as adopted by the European Union as they apply to the fi financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31December 2011 and applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated fi financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand 000 except when otherwise indicated.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated fi financial statements comprise the fi financial statements of Computacenter plc and its subsidiaries as at 31December each year.
The fi financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the Parent Company, using existing GAAP in each country of operation.
Adjustments are made on consolidation translating any differences that may exist between the respective local GAAPs and IFRS.
All intra-Group balances, transactions, income and expenses and profi t and losses resulting from intra-Group transactions have been eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtains control and cease to be consolidated from the date on which the Group no longer retains control.
Non-controlling interests represent the portion of profi t or loss and net assets in subsidiaries that is not held by the Group and is presented separately within equity in the consolidated balance sheet, separately from parent shareholders equity.
Changes in accounting policy and disclosures The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous fi financial year except as follows: The Group has adopted the following new and amended IFRS and IFRIC interpretations during the year.
Except where noted below, adoption of these standards did not have any effect on the fi financial performance or position of the Group.
IAS 24 Related Party Transactions Amendment The IASB has issued an amendment to IAS 24 that clarifi es the defi nitions of a related party.
The new defi nitions emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships as well as clarifying in which circumstances persons and key management personnel affect related party relationships of an entity.
Secondly, the amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for transactions with a government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or signifi cantly infl uenced by the same government as the reporting entity.
The adoption of the amendment did not have any impact on the fi financial position or performance of the Group.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Amendment The IASB issued an amendment that alters the defi nition of a fi financial liability in IAS 32 to enable entities to classify rights issues and certain options or warrants as equity instruments.
The amendment is applicable if the rights are given pro rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entitys non-derivative equity instruments, to acquire a fi xed number of the entitys own equity instruments for a fi xed amount in any currency.
The amendment has had no effect on the fi financial position or performance of the Group because the Group does not have these type of instruments.
IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment The amendment removes an unintended consequence when an entity is subject to minimum funding requirements and makes an early payment of contributions to cover such requirements.
The amendment permits a prepayment of future service cost by the entity to be recognised as a pension asset.
The Group is not subject to minimum funding requirements in Euroland, therefore the amendment of the interpretation has no effect on the fi financial position nor performance of the Group.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Improvements to IFRS In May 2010, the IASB issued its third omnibus of amendments to its standards, primarily with a view to removing inconsistencies and clarifying wording.
There are separate transitional provisions for each standard.
The adoption of the following amendments resulted in changes to accounting policies, but no impact on the fi financial position or performance of the Group.
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: The amendment clarifi es that an entity may present an analysis of each component of other comprehensive income may be either in the statement of changes in equity or in the notes to the fi financial statements.
Other amendments resulting from improvements to IFRSs to the following standards did not have any impact on the accounting policies, fi financial position or performance of the Group: IFRS 3 Business Combinations: The measurement options available for non-controlling interest NCI IFRS 3 Business Combinations Contingent consideration arising from business combination prior to adoption of IFRS 3 as revised in 2008 IFRS 3 Business Combinations Un-replaced and voluntarily replaced share-based payment awards IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosures IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 34 Interim Financial Statements The following interpretation and amendments to interpretations did not have any impact on the accounting policies, fi financial position or performance of the Group: IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programmes determining the fair value of award credits IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments The Group has not early adopted any other standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective.
Standards issued but not yet effective Standards issued but not yet effective up to the date of issuance of the Groups fi financial statements that the Group reasonably expects to have an impact on disclosures, fi financial position or performance when applied at a future date are listed below.
The Group intends to adopt these standards when they become effective.
IAS 1 Financial Statement Presentation - Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive income IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classifi cation and Measurment IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 12 Disclosure of Involvement with Other Entities IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement Critical judgements and estimates The preparation of the Groups fi financial statements requires management to make judgements on how to apply the Groups accounting policies and make estimates about the future.
Due to the inherent uncertainty in making these critical judgements and estimates, actual outcomes could be different.
The more signifi cant judgements and estimates, where a risk exists that a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities in the next fi financial year could occur, relate to: revenue recognition where, on a limited number of support and managed services contracts, an estimate of the total contract costs is required to determine the stage of completion: estimation of residual value of assets owned to support certain contracts: impairment of intangible assets and goodwill, which is based upon estimates of future cash fl ows and discount rates for the relevant cash-generating units: the estimate of the value of the deferred consideration payable on acquisitions where that consideration is based on future performance or conditions: recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses carried forward, which are dependent upon estimates of future profi tability of certain Group companies: and other estimated tax positions, where the decisions of tax authorities are uncertain.
Further information is provided within this note summarising signifi cant accounting policies, and notes 9 and 14 to the fi financial statements.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 56 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation, down to residual value, is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2550 years Short leasehold improvements shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Fixtures and fi ttings Head offi ce 515 years Other shorter of 7 years and period to expiry of lease Offi ce machinery, computer hardware 315 years Motor vehicles 3 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefi ts are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset.
Any gain or loss arising on fide-recognition of the asset calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the item is included in the income statement in the year the item is derecognised.
Leases Assets held under fi finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefi ts incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Lease payments are apportioned between the fi finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefi ts of ownership of the asset are classifi ed as operating leases.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Intangible assets Software and software licences Software and software licences include computer software that is not integral to a related item of hardware.
These assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment in value.
Amortisation is calculated on straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
Currently software is amortised over four years except for licence and development costs related to the ERP system which is amortised over seven years.
The carrying values of software and software licences are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If any such indication exists and where the carrying values exceed the estimated recoverable amount, the assets are written down to their recoverable amount.
Software under development Costs that are incurred and that can be specifi cally attributed to the development phase of management information systems for internal use are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, once the asset becomes available for use.
Other intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of a business are carried initially at fair value.
Following initial recognition intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a fi nite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives with charges included in administrative expenses as follows: Existing customer contracts 5 years Existing customer relationships 510 years Tools and technology 7 years The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 57 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Goodwill Business combinations on or after 1 January 2004 are accounted for under IFRS 3 Revised using the purchase method.
Any excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
Goodwill recognised on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, is recorded at its amortised cost at transition to IFRS and is no longer amortised.
Any goodwill asset arising on the acquisition of equity accounted entities is included within the cost of those entities.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 remains set off directly against reserves even if the related investment becomes impaired or the business is disposed of.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
Where an asset does not have independent cash fl ows, the recoverable amount is assessed for the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value in use of the asset or cash-generating unit.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash fl ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specifi c to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
For assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the Group estimates the assets or cash-generating units recoverable amount.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the assumptions used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment was recognised.
The reversal is limited so that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its recoverable amount, nor exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
As the Group has no assets carried at revalued amounts, such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Investment in associates The Groups interests in its associates, being those entities over which it has signifi cant infl uence and which are neither subsidiaries nor joint ventures, are accounted for using the equity method.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
The Group income statement refl ects the share of the associates results after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any such change in the Group statement of other comprehsive income.
Financial assets Financial assets are recognised at their fair value which initially equates to the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs associated with the investment.
The subsequent measurement of fi financial assets depends on their classifi cation as described in each category below.
Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
Costs include those incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, on a fi first-in, fi first-out basis.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 58 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 3090-day terms, are recognised and carried at their original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Balances are written off when the probability of recovery is assessed as being remote.
Receivables subject to factoring arrangement Some of the Groups trade receivables are subject to factoring arrangements.
These transactions do not meet IAS 39s requirements for derecognition, since the risks and rewards have not been substantially transferred.
All receivables sold through factoring transactions which do not meet the IAS 39 derecognition criteria continue to be recognised in full in the Group fi financial statements even though they are legally subject to the factoring arrangement: a corresponding liability is recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as Factor Financing.
Gains and losses relating to the sale of such assets are not recognised until the assets are derecognised.
Current asset investments Current asset investments comprise deposits held for a term of greater than three months from the date of deposit and which is not available to the Group on demand.
Subsequent to initial measurement, current asset investments are measured at fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash fl ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits as defi ned above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Interest-bearing borrowings All borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
fide-recognition of fi financial assets and liabilities Financial assets A fi financial asset or, where applicable, a part of a fi financial asset or part of a group of similar fi financial assets is derecognised where: the rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset have expired: the Group retains the right to receive cash fl ows from the asset, but has assumed an obligation to pay them in full without material delay to a third party under a pass-through arrangement: or the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash fl ows from the asset and either a has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or b has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
Financial liabilities A fi financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires.
Cash fl ow hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income in the cashfl ow hedge reserve, while any ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement in other operating expenses.
The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and fi rm commitments.
The ineffective portion is recognised in other operating income.
Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profi t or loss, such as when the hedged fi financial expense is recognised.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Derivative fi financial instruments and hedge accounting The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fl uctuations.
Forward contracts are initially recognised at fair value on the date that the contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value at each reporting date.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profi les.
Forward contracts are recorded as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classifi ed as cash fl ow hedges when hedging the exposure to variability in cash fl ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognised fi rm commitment.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedge relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge.
The documentation includes identifi cation of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instruments fair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged items fair value or cash fl ows attributable to the hedged risk.
Such hedges are expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in cash fl ows and are addressed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the fi financial reporting periods for which they are designated.
If the forecast transaction or fi rm commitment is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remains in other comprehensive income until after the forecast transaction or fi rm commitment affects profi t or loss.
Any other gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on forward contracts are taken directly to the income statement.
Foreign currency translation The Groups presentation currency is Pounds Sterling.
Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the fi financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All differences are taken to the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate as at the date of initial transaction.
The functional currencies of the overseas subsidiaries are Euro, US dollar US$, South African rand ZAR and Swiss franc CHF.
As at the reporting date, the assets and liabilities of these overseas subsidiaries are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and their income statements are translated at the average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
On disposal of a foreign entity, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in the income statement.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outfl ow of resources embodying economic benefi ts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash fl ows at a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specifi c to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a borrowing cost.
Taxation Current tax Current tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the tax authorities.
The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 60 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the fi financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profi t or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profi t will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses, can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to the statement of comprehensive income if it relates to items that are credited or charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Sales tax Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except: where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of goods and services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense item as applicable: and trade receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
The net amount of sales tax recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included as part of receivables or payables in the balance sheet.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefi ts will fl ow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts and rebates given to customers, VAT and other sales tax or duty.
The following specifi c recognition criteria must also be met before revenue is recognised: Supply Chain Revenue is recognised when the signifi cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer, usually on dispatch of goods.
Professional Services Revenue is recognised when receivable under a contract following delivery of a service or in line with the stage of work completed.
The stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If the total estimated costs and revenues of a contract cannot be reliably estimated, revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
A provision is made as soon as a loss is foreseen.
Support and Managed Services Contracted service revenue is recognised on a percentage of completion basis.
Usually revenue is recognised on a straight-line basis, when this is representative of the stage of completion of an individual contract.
Unrecognised contracted revenue is included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Amounts invoiced relating to more than one period are deferred and recognised over their relevant life.
On a limited number of Support and Managed Service contracts recognising revenue on a straight-line basis is not representative of the stage of completion.
On these contracts, the stage of completion is determined by reference to the costs incurred as a proportion of the total estimated costs of the contract and unbilled revenue is recognised within accrued income.
If a contract cannot be reliably estimated revenue is recognised only to the extent that costs have been incurred.
Where a contract contains several elements, the individual elements are accounted for separately where appropriate and revenue thereon is measured at the fair value of the consideration received.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61 2 Summary of signifi cant accounting policies continued Finance income Income is recognised as interest accrues.
Dividends Dividend income is recognised when the Groups right to receive payment is established.
Operating leases Rental income arising from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pensions and other post-employment benefi ts The Group operates a defi ned contribution scheme available to all UK employees.
Contributions are recognised as an expense in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
There are no signifi cant pension schemes within the Groups overseas operations.
Exceptional items The Group presents as exceptional items on the face of the income statement, those material items of income and expense which, because of the nature and expected infrequency of the events giving rise to them, merit separate presentation to allow shareholders to understand better elements of fi financial performance in the year, so as to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to assess better trends in fi financial performance.
Share-based payment transactions Employees including Executive Directors of the Group can receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value of the award at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by utilising an appropriate valuation model, further details of which are given in note 28.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions as none of the conditions set are market-related ones.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfi lled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, refl ects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Directors best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The income statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
As the schemes do not include any market-related performance conditions, no expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modifi ed, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modifi ed.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any modifi cation, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise benefi cial to the employee as measured at the date of modifi cation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modifi cation of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is refl ected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings per share see note 10.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as investment in own shares and are recorded at cost as a deduction from equity see note 27.
Own shares held Computacenter plc shares held by the Group are classifi ed in shareholders equity as own shares held and are recognised at cost.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to revenue reserves.
No gain or loss is recognised in the performance statements on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of equity shares.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 62 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 3 Segmental analysis For management purposes, the Group is organised into geographical segments and the management thereof.
The Groups business in each geography is managed separately and can constitute several separate statutory entities.
No operating segments have been aggregated to form the below reportable operating segments.
Management monitor the operating results of its geographical segments separately for the purposes of making decisions about resource allocation and performance assessment.
Segment performance is evaluated based on adjusted operating profi t or loss which is measured differently from operating profi t or loss in the consolidated fi financial statements.
At a Group level however, management measure performance on adjusted profi t before tax.
Adjusted operating profi t or loss takes account of the interest paid on customer specifi c fi nancing CSF which management consider to be a cost of sale for management reporting purposes.
Excluded from adjusted operating profi t is the amortisation of acquired intangibles and exceptional items as management do not consider these items when reviewing the underlying performance of a segment.
Restatement and classifi cation of costs In the prior year consolidated fi financial statements, distribution costs were shown below gross profi t, however, management monitor the performance of the business by including such costs within gross profi t, and reports accordingly to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
As a result, these costs have been included in cost of sales in 2011, and 2010 has been restated accordingly.
From 1 January 2011, the management of Computacenter Luxembourg has been transferred from Belgium to Germany.
As a consequence, CC Luxembourg is reported as part of the German segment.
The comparative segmental information has been restated to refl ect this change.
An adjusted operating loss of 820,343 has been reclassifi ed from the Belgium segment to the Germany segment in the 2010 comparative information.
Following our ERP implementation in the UK and Germany, the Group has been able to further align its structure and therefore how it classifi es departmental costs between cost of sales and administrative expenses.
The Group estimates that the net impact of these changes, principally related to pre-sales costs in Germany, has resulted in approximately 7 million costs being reported in administrative expenses in 2011 that were previously reported in cost of sales in 2010.

This cost comprised of consultancy, legal and professional and tax fees regarding the acquisitions: and due to circumstances arising after the acquisition date, the performance criteria required to trigger deferred consideration of 1.0 million that were previously expected to be achieved, were not met.
As a result, the deferred consideration liability recognised has been reversed, with the gain in the income statement disclosed as an exceptional item.
The exceptional income tax credit for the year comprises two items which, due to their size are disclosed separately as follows: the deferred tax asset in respect of losses in Germany was re-assessed in line with managements view of the entitys future performance.
Where the reassessment exceeds the losses utilised in the year, the change in the recoverable amount of the deferred tax asset is shown as an exceptional item: a deferred tax asset in respect of losses in France was recognised for the fi first time.
The income statement impact of both items has been shown as an exceptional tax item.

e Impact of rate change The main rate of UK Corporation tax was reduced to 26 per cent from 1 April 2011.
The Finance Act 2011 further reduced the main rate of UK Corporation tax to 25 per cent from 1 April 2012.
Deferred tax has been restated accordingly in these fi financial statements.
Additional changes to the main rate of UK Corporation Tax are proposed, to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014.
These changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and consequently are not included in these fi financial statements.
The effect of these proposed reductions would be to reduce the UK net deferred tax asset by 0.1 million.

The goodwill arising on the acquisition is tested for impairment against the Computacenter Germany cash-generating unit.
The acquired assets and liabilities of Top Info were integrated within Computacenter France at 31 December 2011.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition is tested for impairment against the Computacenter France cash-generating unit.
Whilst Damax is managed and therefore reported as part of the Germany segment, it retains its own identifi able cash fl ows.
As a consequence, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of Damax is tested against its own future cash fl ows.
Key assumptions used in value-in-use calculations The recoverable amounts of all fi five cash-generating units have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
To calculate this, cash fl ow projections are based on fi financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period and on long-term market growth rates of between 1.5 and 2.5 per cent 2010: 2.5 per cent thereafter.
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculation for all cash-generating units for 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are: budgeted revenue, which is based on current market conditions, historical trends and long-run market growth forecasts: budgeted gross margins, which are based on average gross margins achieved in the year immediately before the budgeted year, adjusted for expected long-run market pricing trends: and the discount rate applied to cash fl ow projections ranges from 11.0 to 12.0 per cent 2010: 12.0 per cent which represents the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risk profi les of the individual CGUs.
Each cash-generating unit generates value substantially in excess of the carrying value of goodwill attributed to each of them.
Management therefore believes that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the unit to materially exceed its recoverable amount.
No impairment provision on goodwill has been required at either 31 December 2011 or at 31 December 2010.
Other intangible assets Other intangible assets consist of customer contracts, customer relationships and tools and technology.
The expected useful lives are shown in note 2.

The provisional fair values include adjustments to the book values to recognise differences in accounting policies between Top Info and the Group principally relating to revenue recognition, the principal effect of which is a reclassifi cation from trade receivables to inventory.
Included in the 9,610,000 of goodwill that arose on acquisition are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
These items include the expected value of synergies and an assembled workforce.
Deferred consideration Due to circumstances arising after the acquisition date, the performance criteria required to trigger deferred consideration of 1 million that were previously expected to be achieved, were not met.

There were no differences between the provisional fair values and the book values at acquisition other than the recognition of intangible assets at acquisition and the related deferred tax liabilities.
Included in the 3,738,000 of goodwill that arose on acquisition are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
Deferred consideration The criteria required to trigger the further payment for the HSD business have been met.
Accordingly, the full deferred consideration was recognised as at 31 December 2011 in the provisional fair value to the Group.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 75 16 Business combinations continued Damax AG Damax On 21 July 2011, the Group acquired 80 per cent of Damax AG in Switzerland for an initial consideration of CHF 7.2 million, and agreed to purchase the remaining 20 per cent by mid-2015 for a maximum consideration of CHF 3.2 million dependent upon the achievement of agreed performance criteria over the next three and a half years.
Due to the nature of the transaction, that the Group has present access to the benefi ts associated with the remaining 20 per cent of Damax, the Group has recorded this acquisition as a linked transaction, and has accordingly consolidated 100 per cent of the results of Damax since the acquisition date and estimated the fair value of the deferred consideration payable.
The costs of acquisition amounted to 221,000 and are included in the income statement as an exceptional item.
Damax is based in Switzerland and is a Swiss IT service provider.

Included in the 996,000 of goodwill that arose on acquisition are certain intangible assets that cannot be individually separated and reliably measured from the acquiree due to their nature.
Deferred consideration Based on the performance of the business in 2011 and the forecasted performance for the next three years, managements assessment is that it is highly probable that the maximum deferred consideration will become payable and accordingly it has been included in the provisional fair value to the Group.
If the acquisition of Top Info, HSD and Damax had taken place at the beginning of 2011, Group revenues for the period ended 31 December 2011 would have been 2,895,960,399 and profi t after tax would have been 62,976,417.

Financial assets and liabilities through profi t or loss are those foreign exchange contracts that are not designated in hedge relationships as they are intended to reduce the level of foreign currency risk for expected sales and purchases.
Foreign exchange forward contracts measured at fair value through other comprehensive income are designated as hedging instruments in cash fl ow hedges of forecast sales in the United Kingdom and forecast costs in South Africa.
These forecast transactions are highly probable.
The Group also enters into other foreign exchange forward contracts with the intention to reduce the foreign exchange risk of expected sales and purchases.
When these other contracts are not designated in hedge relationships they are measured at fair value through profi t and loss.
The foreign exchange forward contract balances vary with the level of expected foreign currency costs and changes in the foreign exchange forward rates.
The terms of the foreign currency forward contracts have been negotiated for the expected highly probable forecast transactions to which hedge accounting has been applied.
No signifi cant element of hedge ineffectiveness required recognition in the income statement.
The cash fl ow hedges of the forecasted costs were assessed to be highly effective and a net unrealised loss of 464,000 with a deferred tax asset of 116,000 relating to the hedging instruments is included in the other comprehensive income.
The amounts retained in the other comprehensive income is expected to mature and affect the income statement in 2012.

Those in respect of the European operations are discounted at a rate based on Euribor.
25 Financial instruments An explanation of the Groups fi financial instrument risk management objectives, policies and strategies are set out in the Finance Directors Review on pages 16 to 19. Credit risk The Group principally manages credit risk through management of customer credit limits.
The credit limits are set for each customer based on the creditworthiness of the customer and the anticipated levels of business activity.
These limits are initially determined when the customer account is fi first set up and are regularly monitored thereafter.
The balance of trade receivables relates to customers for whom there is no recent history of default.
In determining the recoverability of the trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivables from the date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The maximum exposure on trade receivables, as at the reporting date, is their carrying value.
In France, credit risk is mitigated through a credit insurance policy which applies to non-Government customers and provides insurance for approximately 50 per cent of the relevant credit risk exposure.
With respect to credit risk arising from the other fi financial assets of the Group and forward currency contracts, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum exposure equal to their carrying amount.
There are no signifi cant concentrations of credit risk within the Group.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 82 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 25 Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Group fi nances its operations through a mixture of retained profi ts, cash and short-term deposits, bank borrowings and fi finance leases and loans for certain customer contracts.
The Groups bank borrowings, other facilities and deposits are at fl oating rates.
No interest rate derivative contracts have been entered into.
When long-term borrowings are utilised, the Groups policy is to maintain these borrowings at fi xed rates to limit the Groups exposure to interest rate fl uctuations.
Fair values The carrying value of the Groups short-term receivables and payables is a reasonable approximation of their fair values.
The fair value of all other fi financial instruments carried within the Groups fi financial statements is not materially different from their carrying amount.
Interest rate sensitivity The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profi t before tax through the impact on fl oating rate borrowings.
There is no impact on the Groups equity.
Change Effect in basis on profi t points before tax 000 000 2011 Sterling 25 132 Euro 25 104 2010 Sterling 25 236 Euro 25 38 The impact of a reasonably possible decrease to the same range shown in the table would result in an opposite impact on the profi t before tax of the same magnitude.
Forward currency contracts At 31 December 2011 the Group held foreign exchange contracts as hedges of an inter-company loan and future expected payments to suppliers.
The exchange contracts are being used to reduce the exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The terms of these contracts are detailed below: 31 December 2011 Buy Sell Currency value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Sterling Euros 500,000 Jan 12 0.8557 US Dollars Sterling $13,656,870 JanApr 12 1.54001.6098 US Dollars Euros $1,695,465 Mar 12 1.3988 SA Rand Sterling ZAR88,992,000 JanDec 12 11.432512.5270 Germany US Dollars Euros $61,300,000 JanJun 12 1.2941.444 31 December 2010 Buy Sell Currency value of Maturity Contract currency currency contracts dates rates UK Euros Sterling 1,100,000 Feb 11 1.1628 US Dollars Sterling $12,623,564 JanMar 11 1.55721.6189 Germany US Dollars Euros $75,468,000 JanAug 11 1.2281.417 Euros US Dollars 5,724,727 JanApr 11 1.2791.319 The gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the above contracts are detailed in note 22.
Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 83 25 Financial instruments continued Exchange rate sensitivity The majority of the transactions in each of the Groups geographical segments are denominated in the functional currency of that segment.
There are, however, a limited number of transactions where foreign currency exchange risk exists.
In these instances the Group enters into forward currency contracts, as shown in the above table, in order to mitigate such risk.
At the end of the year the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a liability of 168,000 2010: asset of 562,000.
Other than differences arising from the translation of results of operations outside of the Groups functional currency, reasonably foreseeable movements in the exchange rates of 10 per cent or -10 per cent would not have a material impact on the Groups profi t before tax or equity.
Liquidity risk The table below summarises the maturity profi le of the Groups fi financial liabilities as at 31 December based on contractual undiscounted payments: On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2011 Financial liabilities 2,141 3,005 8,084 13,091 436 26,757 Property provisions 384 2,347 8,741 746 12,218 Trade and other payables 530,953 530,953 2,141 534,342 10,431 21,832 1,182 569,928 On demand 3 months 312 months 15 years 5 years Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Year ended 31 December 2010 Financial liabilities 20,498 5,157 13,033 10,884 49,572 Property provisions 2,688 9,348 1,972 14,008 Trade and other payables 440,790 440,790 20,498 445,947 15,721 20,232 1,972 504,370 Fair value measurements recognised in the consolidated balance sheet Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The three levels are defi ned as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had a current asset investment, which was measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of 10.0 million 31 December 2010: nil.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had forward currency contracts, which were measured at Level 2 fair value subsequent to initial recognition, to the value of a liability of of 168,000 31 December 2010: asset of 562,000.
The realised losses from forward currency contracts in the period to 31 December 2011 of 730,000 2010: loss of 164,000, are offset by broadly equivalent realised gains on the related underlying transactions.
Financial statements Governance Business review Overview Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 84 Notes to the consolidated fi financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2011 26 Capital management Computacenters approach to capital management is to ensure that the Group has a strong capital base to support the development of the business and to maintain a strong credit rating, whilst aiming to maximise shareholder value.
Consistent with the Groups aim to maximise return to shareholders, the dividend policy is to maintain a dividend cover of between 22.5 times.
In 2011 the cover was 2.5 times, on a pre-exceptional basis 2010: 2.5 times.
The Groups capital base is primarily utilised to fi finance its fi xed assets and working capital requirements.
The Group intends to optimise the use of working capital and improve its cash fl ow.
As a consequence, the UK has sourced an increasing proportion of its product business via distributors in order to reduce the working capital requirements of the business.
Capital is allocated across the Group in order to minimise the Groups exposure to exchange rates.
Each country fi nances its own working capital requirements, typically resulting in borrowings in France with cash on deposit in the UK and Germany.
During 2011, a notional cash pooling arrangement was introduced, which Group companies can access and allows the Group to pool its funds.
In certain circumstances, the Group enters into customer contracts that are fi nanced by leases, which are secured only on the assets that they fi finance, or loans.
Whilst the outstanding amounts of this customer specifi c fi nancing CSF are included within net funds for statutory reporting purposes, the Group excludes this customer specifi c fi nancing when managing the net funds of the business as this outstanding fi nancing is matched by committed future revenues.
These fi nancing facilities, which are committed, are thus outside of the normal working capital requirements of the Groups product resale and services activities.
In certain circumstances, the Group deposits its funds in short-term investments that do not fulfi ll the criteria to be classifi ed as cash and cash equivalents.
The Group considers these deposits when managing the net funds of the business, and accordingly includes these deposits within net funds excluding CSF.
The measures of net funds that the Group monitors are: 2011 2010 000 000 Net funds excluding CSF 136,784 139,439 Customer specifi c fi nancing 23,148 28,426 Net funds 113,636 111,013 The net funds excluding CSF reduced marginally from 139.4 million to 136.8 million by the end of the year.
In the year, the outfl ow of cash included circa 40 million on specifi c strategic cash investments, such as the remaining expenditure on our ERP implementations in Germany and the UK, the purchase of a new freehold facility for our RDC recycling business for approximately 11 million, and net cash outfl ow on acquisitions of 25.3 million.
The Group was able to fi finance both these projects and its working capital requirements from its existing cash base.
However, the Group continued to benefi t from the extension of a temporary improvement in credit terms with a signifi cant vendor, equivalent to 45 million at 31 December 2011 2010: 38 million.
Each operating country manages working capital in line with Group policies.
The key components of working capital, i. e. trade receivables, inventory and trade payables, are managed in accordance with an agreed number of days targeted in the budget process, in order to ensure effi cient capital usage.
An important element of the process of managing capital effi ciently is to ensure that each operating country rewards behaviour at an Account Manager and Account Director level to minimise working capital, at a transactional level.
This is achieved by increasing commission payments for early payment by customers and reduced commission payments for late payment by customers, which encourages appropriate behaviour.
The Group regularly reviews the adequacy of its facilities against any foreseeable peak borrowing requirement, and as a result of the strong cash position, has allowed certain bank and factoring facilities to expire during 2010 and 2011.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had available 15.9 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities 2010: 15.5 million.
