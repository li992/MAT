NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2011 25.
Financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The Treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of credit, foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
The Group Treasury department is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged.
a Credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and cash on deposit with financial institutions.
Management has a credit policy in place and exposure to credit risk is both monitored on an ongoing basis and reduced through the use of credit insurance covering 80% to 90% of trade receivables at any time.
Credit evaluations are carried out on all customers requiring credit above a certain threshold, with varying approval levels set above this depending on the value of the sale.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Goods are sold subject to retention of title clauses, so that in the event of non-payment the Group may have a secured claim.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment in respect of non-insured receivables where recoverability is considered doubtful.
The Group Treasury Committee meets regularly and reviews the credit risk associated with institutions that hold a material cash balance.
As well as credit ratings, counterparties and instruments are assessed for credit default swap pricing, liquidity of funds and interest rate.
Exposure to credit risk The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date was: Carrying amount 2011 2010 Trade receivables 96,734 70,362 Other receivables 10,017 7,974 Cash and cash equivalents 48,557 97,881 Foreign exchange contracts 992 918 156,300 177,135 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by currency was: Carrying amount 2011 2010 Sterling 7,710 5,107 US dollar 24,259 14,183 Euro 43,249 37,730 Indian rupee 4,420 3,002 Other 17,096 10,340 96,734 70,362 ROTORK P.

The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Groups reputation.
The Group is highly cash generative, and uses monthly cash flow forecasts to monitor cash requirements and to optimise its return on investments.
Typically the Group ensures that it has sufficient cash on hand to meet foreseeable operational expenses: it also maintains a 7m overdraft facility 2010: 2m on which interest would be payable at base rate plus 150 basis points.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of netting agreements: Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2011 amount cash flows 12 months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Bank loans and overdrafts 198 198 69 35 94 Finance lease liabilities 114 122 62 36 24 Trade and other payables 77,102 77,102 77,102 Foreign exchange contracts 614 614 596 18 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 78,068 78,076 77,829 89 118 40 Analysis of contractual cash flow maturities Carrying Contractual Less than More than 31 December 2010 amount cash flows 12 months 1-2 years 2-5 years 5 years Finance lease liabilities 136 145 54 45 46 Trade and other payables 56,781 56,781 56,781 Forward exchange contracts 294 294 294 Non-redeemable preference shares 40 40 40 57,251 57,260 57,129 45 46 40 Where a counterparty experiences credit stress then the foreign exchange contracts may be settled on a net basis but standard practice is to settle on a gross basis and the undiscounted gross outflow in respect of these contracts is 116,580,000 2010: 50,428,000 and the gross inflow is 117,216,000 2010: 51,191,000.

Financial instruments continued c Market risks Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as currency rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups results.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk within suitable parameters.
i Currency risk The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominated in a currency other than the business units functional currency.
The currencies primarily giving rise to this risk are the US dollar and related currencies and the euro.
The Group hedges up to 75% of forecast US dollar or euro foreign currency exposures using forward exchange contracts.
In respect of other nonsterling monetary assets and liabilities the exposures are maintained and hedged up to 75% where this is deemed appropriate.
As part of the Groups cash management some of the subsidiaries have loan and deposit balances where their intragroup counterparty is in the UK.
The balances are typically in local currency for the subsidiary, and the UK holds a foreign currency current asset which is hedged through the use of foreign exchange swaps.
At the balance sheet date only the forward part of the swap remains and this is designated as a cash flow hedge to match the currency exposure of the intercompany loan asset.
The Group classifies its forward exchange contracts that hedge both the forecast sale and purchase transactions and the intercompany loan and deposit balances as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The net fair value of foreign exchange contracts used as hedges at 31 December 2011 was a 378,000 asset 2010: 624,000 asset comprising an asset of 992,000 2010: 918,000 and a liability of 614,000 2010: 294,000.
Forward exchange contracts in place at 31 December 2011 mature in 2012 and 2013.
Changes in the fair value of foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies, and for which no hedge accounting is applied, are recognised in the income statement.
Sensitivity analysis It is estimated that, with all other variables held equal in particular other exchange rates, a general change of one cent in the value of either the US dollar or euro against sterling would have had an impact on the Groups operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 350,000.
The method of estimation, which has been applied consistently, involves assessing the transaction impact of US dollar and euro cash flows and the translation impact of US dollar and euro profits.
The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: Average rate Closing rate 2011 2010 2011 2010 US dollar 1.59 1.54 1.55 1.57 Euro 1.15 1.16 1.20 1.17 ii Interest rate risk The Group does not undertake any hedging activity in this area.
All cash deposits are made at prevailing interest rates and the majority is available with same day notice, though deposits are sometimes made with a maturity of no more than three months.
The main element of interest rate risk concerns Sterling, US dollar and Renminbi deposits, all of which are on a floating rate basis.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2011 2010 Fixed rate financial liabilities 269 118 Floating rate financial liabilities 83 58 352 176 ROTORK P.

Financial instruments continued c Market risks continued ii Interest rate risk continued The fixed and floating rate financial liabilities comprise finance leases, preference shares and bank loans.
The floating rate lease obligations bear interest at rates determined by reference to the relevant LIBOR or equivalent rate.
The weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate financial liabilities is 1.6% or 5.3% excluding the zero rate debt 2010: 6.4%.
The weighted average period for which non zero interest rates on the fixed rate financial liabilities are fixed is 2.3 years.
The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December was as follows: 2011 2010 In one year or less 123 49 In more than one year but not more than two years 72 43 In more than two years but not more than five years 117 44 In more than five years 40 40 Total 352 176 d Capital risk management The primary objective of the Groups capital management is to ensure it maintains sufficient capital in order to support its business and maximise shareholder value.
The group has an asset-light business model and uses cash generated from operations to either invest organically or by acquisition.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic and market conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders or issue new shares.
The Group defines capital as net funds and equity attributable to shareholders see note 16.
There are no externally imposed restrictions on the Groups capital structure.
The Group monitors capital using the following indicators: Group net funds 2011 2010 Total borrowings 352 176 Cash and cash equivalents note 15 48,557 97,881 Group net funds 48,205 97,705 ROTORK P.

Designated cash flow hedges Forward exchange contracts are valued at year end spot rates adjusted for the forward points to the appropriate value dates, and gains and losses are taken to equity.
Trade and other receivables payables As the majority of receivables payables have a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
