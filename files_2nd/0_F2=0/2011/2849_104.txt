Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk including foreign exchange, cash flow interest rate risk and fair value interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Group treasury identifies, evaluates and hedges financial risks in close cooperation with the Groups operating units.
The Board provides written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
a Market risk i Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on sales, purchases, and translation of assets and liabilities that are in a currency other than the functional currency of its operating units.
The Group is also exposed to the translation of the functional currencies of its units to GB pound which is the reporting currency of the Group.
The Groups policy is to use forward contracts to manage the currency exposure on transactions significant to its operations although forward currency contracts are not entered into until a highly probable forecast transaction is in place.
Group management has completed a sensitivity analysis on the exposure of the Group to reasonable movements in the main functional currencies used by the subsidiaries and has concluded that the impact on profit and equity is minimal.
At 31 December 2011, if the pound had weakened by 10% against the Australian dollar AUD with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 0.2 million 2010: 0.1 million higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of AUD-denominated trade receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and debt securities classified as available for sale.
At 31 December 2011, if the pound had weakened by 10% against the US dollar with all other variables held constant, post-tax profit for the year would have been 1.5 million 2010: 1.3 million higher, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains losses on translation of US dollar-denominated trade receivables, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss, debt securities classified as available for sale and foreign exchange losses gains on translation of US dollar-denominated borrowings.
