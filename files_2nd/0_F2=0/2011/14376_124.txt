Accounts and other information Notes to the Group accounts continued 18 Provisions and contingencies Accounting policy In the normal course of business the Group is involved in numerous legal disputes.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Contingent assets are not recognised in the accounts unless they are virtually certain of being realised.
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation.
In making its estimates management takes into account the advice of internal and external legal counsel.
Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reect developments in the disputes.
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings and settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benets to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.
For the purposes of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group has taken the discounted future lease payments, net of expected rental income.
Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.

On 6 February 2012, Smith & Nephew announced that it had reached settlement with the SEC and DOJ in connection with this matter.
Smith & Nephew has committed to pay approximately $23m in fines and profit disgorgement, maintain an enhanced compliance programme, and appoint an independent monitor for at least 18 months to review and report on its compliance programme.
The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various litigation and patent disputes.
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within three years of 31 December 2011 and none are treated as financial instruments.
18.2 Contingencies The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages.
The outcome of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them will result in a material adverse effect on the financial position of the Group.
The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated.
There is no assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Groups results of operations in the period in which they are realised.
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
