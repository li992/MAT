FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financialstatements Year ended 31 December 2011 1.
Accounting policies Perform Group plc is a public limited liability company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006.
The address of the registered office is Sussex House, Plane Tree Crescent, Feltham, Middlesex, TW13 7HE.
The nature of the Group's operations and its principal activities are set in the Directors' Report.
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group's entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the parent's functional and presentational currency.
Basis of preparation The Group's consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The Group had cash balances of 75.9m at the year end of which 75.4m was unrestricted and 13.0m of debt relating to borrowings of12.5m of which 5.5m is due in less than one year and finance leases of 0.5m of which 0.3m is due in less than one year.
Having reviewed cashflow forecasts and budgets for the year ahead the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has sufficient resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis inpreparing the accounts.
Adoption of new and revised standards At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published by the IASB but are not yet effective, and have not been adopted early by the Group.
Management anticipates that all of the relevant pronouncements will be adopted in the Groups accounting policies for the first period beginning after the effective date of the pronouncement.
Information on new standards, amendments and interpretations that are expected to be relevant to the Groups financial statements is provided below.
Certain other new standards and interpretations have been issued but are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups financial statements.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments IFRS 9 The IASB aims to replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement in its entirety.
IFRS9 is being issued in phases.
To date, the chapters dealing with recognition, classification, measurement and derecognition of financial assets and liabilities have been issued.
These chapters are effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2013.
Further chapters dealing with impairment methodology and hedge accounting are still being developed.
The Groups management have yet to assess the impact of this new standard on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
However, they do not expect to implement IFRS 9 until all of its chapters have been published and they can comprehensively assess the impact of all changes.
Consolidation Standards A package of consolidation standards are effective for annual periods beginning or after 1 January 2013.
Information on these new standards is presented below.
The Groups management have yet to assess the impact of these new and revised standards on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements IFRS 10 IFRS 10 supersedes IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 27 and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
It revised the definition of control together with accompanying guidance to identify an interest in a subsidiary.
However, the requirements and mechanics of consolidation and the accounting for any non-controlling interests and changes incontrol remain the same.
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements IFRS 11 IFRS 11 supersedes IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures IAS 31.
It aligns more closely the accounting by the investors with their rights and obligations relating to the joint arrangement.
In addition, IAS 31s option of using proportionate consolidation for joint ventures has been eliminated.
IFRS 11 now requires the use of the equity accounting method, which is currently used for investments inassociates.
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities IFRS 12 IFRS 12 integrates and makes consistent the disclosure requirements for various types of investments, including unconsolidated structured entities.
It introduces new disclosure requirements about the risks to which an entity isexposed from its involvement with structured entities.
58 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 OVERVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Consequential amendments to IAS 27 and IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures IAS 28 IAS 27 now only deals with separate financial statements.
IAS 28 brings investments in joint ventures into its scope.
However, IAS 28s equity accounting methodology remainsunchanged.
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement IFRS 13 IFRS 13 does not affect which items are required to be fair-valued, but clarifies the definition of fair value and provides related guidance and enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements.
It is applicable for annual periods beginning onor after 1 January 2013.
The Groups management have yet to assess the impact of this new standard.
Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements IAS 1 Amendments The IAS 1 Amendments require an entity to group items presented in other comprehensive income into those that, inaccordance with other IFRSs: a will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss and b will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met.
It is applicable for annual periods beginning on orafter 1 July 2012.
The Groups management expects this will change the current presentation of items in other comprehensive income: however, itwill not affect the measurement or recognition of such items.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities and is achieved through direct or indirect ownership of voting rights, currently exercisable or convertible potential voting rights by way of contractual arrangement.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenditure are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group's equity therein.
The interests of non-controlling shareholders may be initially measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree's identifiable net assets.
The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition by acquisition basis.
Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests' share of subsequent changesinequity.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having adeficitbalance.
Changes in the Group's interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
The carrying amount of the Group's interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries.
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
Business combinations On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Anyexcess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost ofacquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net asset acquired is credited to the income statement in the period ofacquisition.
Changes in the Group's ownership interest that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.
Purchase of  are recognised directly within equity being the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of the net assets to the subsidiary.
Contingent and deferred consideration arising as a result of acquisitions is stated at fair value.
Contingent and deferred consideration is based onmanagement's best estimate of the likely outcome and best estimate of fair value, which is usually, but not always, a contracted formula based on a multiple of revenues and or EBITDA.
The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations prior to the date of transition of1 January 2008.
Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financialstatements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 1.
Accounting policies continued Investment in Joint Ventures A Joint Venture is an entity in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which is jointly controlled by the Group and one or more venturers under a contractual arrangement.
For both joint venture entities in which the Group held an interest during the previous reporting period the Group was obliged to make payments on behalf of the joint venture.
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures are incorporated into these Group financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in joint ventures were carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Group's share of the net assets of the entity, less any impairment in the value of the individual investments.
The Group disposed of its interest in its two joint ventures Holy Moly Entertainment Ltd and MFC.
co. uk Ltd during the year to 31 December 2010.
Losses of both the joint ventures in excess of the Group were only recognised to the extent that the Group incurred legal or constructive obligations relating to those losses.
Accordingly, losses of the Joint Venture Holy Moly Entertainment Ltd in excess of the Group's interest in that entity were not recognised but losses of the joint venture MFC.
co. uk Ltd in excess of the Group's interest in that entity were recognised.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group's share of the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 2008, which was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 10 years, has been retained atthe previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for impairment annually.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services falling within the Group's continuing ordinary activities, after the deduction of value added tax.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable.
Content distribution Revenue related to the delivery of Watch&Bet is recognised in line with the contract with the exception of any material actual or anticipated under delivery of events which either a contractually cannot be recovered or b which the Directors do not consider can be recovered.
Thisisderecognised at the earlier of the point it is no longer contractually possible to deliver the events and the date at which the Directors donot consider the under delivery can be recovered.
Revenue related to sales of OMNISPORT, Watchandtrade and GSM products are recognised evenly across a contractual licenceperiod.
Subscription Sales of online subscription products, mobile downloads, online pay-per-view transactions and sms alerts are recognised across the period inwhich service is provided.
The clients' shares of such revenues are shown within cost of sales.
Technology and production Service fees generated from the ongoing provision of website servicing, maintenance and hosting to customers are recognised in line withthe service delivery to the customer, which is usually evenly across a contractual period.
Fees arising from the building of products for customers or for structural enhancements to existing customer products are recognised inline withcontractual milestones during the contractual build period.
60 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 OVERVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Advertising and sponsorship Revenue related to sponsorship activity is recognised in line with the services physically delivered compared to the services specified within acontract agreed with a sponsor.
Revenue related to static display and video advertising is recognised based on the number of advertising impressions physically delivered compared to the required number of advertising impressions included within a contract agreed with either a brand or an advertising agency.
Where the Group represents a third-party website, the clients' shares of such revenues are shown within cost of sales.
Segmental reporting In accordance with IFRS 8, operating segments are reporting in a manner that is consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Board ofDirectors, the chief operating decision maker.
Intangible assets computer software development Where in the opinion of the Directors, the Group's expenditure in relation to development of software results in future economic benefits, thesecosts including directly attributable overheads are capitalised and amortised over the useful economic life of the asset.
Development costs are capitalised only when it is probable that future economic benefit will result from the project and the following criteriaaremet: the technical feasibility of the product has been ascertained: adequate technical, financial and other resources are available to complete and sell or use the intangible asset: the Group can demonstrate how the intangible asset will generate future economic benefits and the ability to use or sell the intangible assetcan be demonstrated: it is the intention of management to complete the intangible asset and use it or sell it: and the development costs can be measured reliably.
Where these criteria are not met development costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Amortisation is provided on computer software development at a rate calculated to write each asset down to its estimated residual value, usingthe straight line method, over its useful life, usually three years.
Methods of amortisation, residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each reporting date.
Intangible assets other Identifiable intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations, that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3, arerecognised attheir fair value at the acquisition date and amortised over their useful economic life as follows: Database content three years URLs indefinite life Customer relationships - three years Website architecture - three years Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment atrates calculated to write each asset down to its residual value, using straight line method, over its expected useful life asfollows: Internet hosting platform three years Office furniture and equipment three years Leasehold improvements three years Motor vehicles three years Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Notes to the Group financialstatements continued Year ended 31 December 2011 1.
Accounting policies continued Impairment of tangible and intangible assets At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, tangible and intangible assets, joint ventures and intangible assets not yet available for use to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the assets is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit product to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there isan indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of the fair value, less costs to sell, and the value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows, which are based on budgeted figures, are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, so that the increase carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset or cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as incomeimmediately.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group's balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables and other receivable financial assets Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition plus transaction costs if any and carried atamortised cost under the effective interest method.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short term deposits held by the Group.
It also includes cash held on deposit with the Group's credit card service provider, Streamline.
Financial liability and equity Financial liability and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Equityinstruments issued are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Borrowings Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
Afterinitial recognition, these are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
Trade and other payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value on initial recognition plus transaction costs if any and carried at amortised cost under the effective interest method.
The fair value of trade and other payables has not been disclosed as, due to their short duration, management considers the carrying values recognised in the balance sheet to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value.
Foreign currency translation Foreign currency transactions of individual companies are translated at the rates ruling when they occurred.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the closing spot rate.
Exchange differences which arise from translation are recognised in the IncomeStatement.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year and their balance sheets translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the reporting date.
Exchange differences which arise from translation of the opening net assets and results of foreign subsidiary undertakings and from translating the income statement at an average rate are recognised as Other ComprehensiveIncome.
62 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 OVERVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Leasing Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the Income statement over the term of the relevant lease and in accordance with the terms of the relevant leases.
Operating lease costs relating to accommodation are recognised in the income statement under '.
Rentals payable under finance leases, which includes lease costs relating to technical equipment are treated differently.
The net present value of the total lease rental payments are included within property, plant and equipment and depreciated over the useful economic life of the asset.
Thedifference between the actual rentals payable and their net present value is treated as a finance cost which is recognised in line withthe period of the lease and recognised on the income statement within 'Finance costs'.
A liability in relation to finance leases isrecognised withinLiabilities.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after share of the post-tax results of joint ventures but before investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted bythe balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised tothe extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can beutilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition other than inabusiness combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for temporary difference arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of the deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable thatsufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred taxis charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity or other comprehensive income.
Share-based payments Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees' services are determined indirectly by reference tothe fair value of the instrument granted to the employee.
This fair value is appraised at the grant date and for cash settled instruments isre-appraised at each balance sheet date.
All equity settled share-based payments are ultimately recognised as an expense in the income statement with a corresponding credit toreserves.
All cash settled share-based payments have a corresponding liability.
If vesting periods apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period.
Estimates are revised subsequently if there is any indications that thenumber of awards expected to vest differs from previous estimates.

Accounting policies continued Pension The Group makes contributions on behalf of employees to an independent, defined contribution pension scheme.
The Perform Group Personal Pension Plan is operated by Aegon Scottish Equitable.
The Group has no legal obligation to pay further contributions after the payment of its fixed contribution, providing that fixed contribution is matched by an employee.
These contributions are recognized as anexpense in the period the relevant employee services are received.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty In the application of the Group's accounting policies, which are described in this Statement of Group Accounting Policies, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period inwhich the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group's accounting policies The items below are critical judgements that the Directors believe have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in these financialstatements: Internally generated software and research Management monitors progress of internal software development projects by using a project management system.
Significant judgement isrequired in distinguishing whether such development should be written off or capitalised.
Development costs are recognised as an asset whenall the criteria are met, costs are not capitalised and are written off where this is not the case.
The Group's management also monitors whether the recognition requirements for development costs continue to be met.
This is necessary asthe economic success of any product development is uncertain and may be subject to future technical problems or developments after thetime of recognition.
Treatment of subsidiary undertakings and related deferred consideration The Group has one subsdiary Sportal which was not wholly owned at the year-end and two further subsidiaries Global Sports Media andWatchandTrade which were not wholly owned for the full year.
These have all been consolidated and included as subsidiary undertakings in the Group's financial statements.
The Directors have reviewed the accounting treatment of each subsidiary to confirm that they should not beaccounted for as joint ventures.
In each case these reviews concluded that the Group had effective control either through its actual influence onthe strategic and operational policies ofthe companies and or through its contractual rights to acquire 100 per cent control of voting equity.
Contingent consideration Contingent consideration arising as a result of acquisitions is stated at fair value.
Subscription and advertising sales revenue recognition The Group provides online and mobile subscription based products to its customers, usually via customer branded websites to end users.
The Group sets the price of these products, collects revenues and delivers the products, including after service customer care.
TheDirectors reviewed the products and the nature of how they were supplied and concluded that the revenue generated from these products should beshown as that of the Group being a principal to these transactions with customer revenue share payments included incost ofsales.
The Group acts as advertising sales agent for online advertising inventory of a network of internet sites.
The Group has built this network and seeks advertising campaigns from brands and media agencies to deliver via this network.
The Group employs its sales staff at its own risk, effectively negotiates prices and delivers traffics the advertising campaigns.
The Directors have reviewed these arrangements and concluded that the revenue generated from these products should be shown as that of the Group being a principal to these transactions with customer internet sites revenue share payments included in cost of sales, rather than as an agent.
64 Perform Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 OVERVIEW BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW GOVERNANCE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Key sources of estimation uncertainty The estimates and assumptions, which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite lives are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units products entities to which goodwill or those intangible assets have been allocated.
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash generating units products and a suitable discount rate in order tocalculate present value.

12,515 Spox Media GmbH and mediasports Digital GmbH 6,035 At 31 December 2011 57,192 For the purpose of annual impairment testing goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units, which are the units expected tobenefit from the synergies of the business combinations in which the goodwill arises: 2011 2010 '000 '000 Subscriptions, technology and production 19,283 19,283 Content distribution 18,120 18,120 Advertising and sponsorship display 10,743 1,239 Advertising and sponsorship video 9,046 - Total 57,192 38,642 As stated in the Statement of Group Accounting Policies, the Group performs an annual impairment review for goodwill, by comparing the carrying amount of these assets with their recoverable amount.
With the exception of domain names acquired, no intangible assets are currently assumed to have indefinite lives.
Animpairment test at the date of transition to IFRS was undertaken with no impairment noted.
Testing is carried out by allocating the carrying value of these assets to groups of cash generating units CGUs.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined by value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates assumed in the CGUs' business plans.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and risks specific to the CGUs.
Management estimates growth rates based on experience within the markets in which the CGUs operate.
The discount rate applied to the future cash flows of all the CGUs was 10 per cent 2010: 10 per cent.
Each CGU's forecast is based on growth rates ranging from 10 per cent to 100 per cent, depending on the year, with the range reflecting that many of the CGUs' products are new to the market, and is also based on current year performance assumptions.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts on an extrapolated basis over five years from the CGUs forecast annual budgets which are approved by management.
These plans have varying rates of growth due to the different factors driving the individual CGUs revenue and profit growth see Directors' Report.
In its five year forecasts the Group has, in some instances, applied growth rates significantly in excess of that of the current economic environment because the Directors' believe that the Group's success in creating value for its customers' digital rights, the length and nature of its existing contracts and itsinternational customer base will result in the Group's results improving significantly quicker than that of the current economy.
The Group consider it unlikely that changes in a key assumption could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverableamount.

Financial risk management The Group's activities expose it to a variety of financial risks.
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to foreign exchange rates, interest rate risks, the risk of default by counter-parties to financial transactions and the availability of funds to meet business needs.
These risks are managed as described below.
The Group's risk management is coordinated at its headquarters, in close cooperation with the board of Directors, and focuses on actively securing the Group's short to medium term cash flows by minimising the exposure to financial markets.
The Group does not actively engage in the trading of financial assets for speculative purposes.
The most significant financial risks to which the Group is exposed are described below.
Currency risk The Group's objective when managing currency risk is to ensure that changes in exchange rates would not have a material impact on the Group.
The Group's policy is to review the level of revenues and costs denominated in various key currencies and to naturally hedge wherever possible.
Where this is not possible and a currency risk is forecast the Directors' strategy is to acquire forward options to mitigate the level of risk.
Forward contracts were put in place during the year to 31 December 2010.
No forward contracts were put in place during 2011 or were outstanding at the year-end.

The Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and other reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as it borrows funds at floating rate interest rates.
The Group is required to hedge at least two-thirds of the loan via an interest rate swap hedging floating rate interest for fixed rate interest.
The interest rate swap settles on a quarterly basis.
Afloating rate of LIBOR plus 3.5 per cent premium is swapped to a fixed rate of 1.94 per cent plus 3.5 per cent margin.
The Directors do not consider that this derivative had a material value at 31 December 2011.
The Group's hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align them with interest rate views and defined risk appetite, ensuring the most appropriate hedging strategies are applied.
If interest rates had been three per cent higher lower and all other values were held constant, the Group's profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 wouldincrease decrease by 0.4m due to the Group's exposure to floating interest rates.

"Growth Securities Ownership Plan GSOP In March 2010, the Board resolved to put in place a Growth Securities Ownership Plan the ""GSOP""."
Under the GSOP, certain key non-shareholding employees were given the opportunity to purchase a financial instrument which tracks the Company's enterprise value defined as market capitalisation for these purposes over a set period, being the period ending 12 months after the occurrence ofanexitevent.
As at 31 December 2010 and 2011, 21 senior employees none of whom is a Director or a current shareholder in the Company held a total of 35 units under the plan.
The terms of the GSOP provide for cash payments, on a pro-rata basis, by the Company to participants subject to such participant's continued employment at the Group at the date payable if the Company's enterprise value at the end of the relevant period exceeds a floor amount.
The amount payable to participants increases up to a maximum aggregate amount of 6 million which is payable ifthe Company's enterprise value at such time is not less than 450 million.
"For these purposes, an Admission to the London Stock Exchange ""Admission"" will constitute an exit event."
Therefore, the company willberequired to pay up to 6 million at the date falling 12 months and 40 days after Admission to participants under the GSOP.
The fair values of the financial instruments entered into under this scheme were calculated and were purchased by the participants atthisprice.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge of 4,770,000 in the year 2010: nil in respect of this cash settled scheme.
"Performance Share Plan PSP On 24 June 2011 the Group put in place a Performance Share Plan ""PSP"" which uses shares to provide long-term incentives to Executive Directors and senior management of the Group."

Awards will vest in June 2014, subject to continued employment.
In the event that all the performance criteria are met, a maximum number of 1,400,000 shares will vest.
The fair value of each award is 2.19 calculated by reference to the closing market price on the dealing day preceding the date of grant.
None of the awards lapsed during the year.
Based on the Group's three year forecasts, management expect that 65 per cent of the shares will vest.
In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge of 352,000 2010: nil in respect of this equity settled scheme.
Ordinary B Shares The Group had a class of share, the B Ordinary Shares, which are part paid on issue.
These were issued to senior staff as a share incentive scheme.
The Group applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to these shares.
The cost to the Group of these incentives wasmeasured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight line basis over an estimated period of three years.
The charge intheyear was nil 2010: 111,000.
These shares were redesignated in the year as set out in note 25.
Fair value was calculated using the binomial option pricing model.
The expected life is the expected period until a Company share event sale orIPO.
The volatility was based on comparison with similar, quoted, companies.
The risk-free interest rate used was bank base rate.
