Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 30th September 2011 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the AIC in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of investments at fair value.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off to capital at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value which are quoted bid market prices for investments traded in active markets.
Gains and losses on sales of investments, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, are dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Deposit interest receivable and stock lending income are taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: any performance fee is allocated 100% to capital: expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and include items such as stamp duty and brokerage commissions.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 46.

Accounting policies continued e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Bank loans are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative financial instruments, including short term forward currency contracts, are valued at fair value and are included in current assets or current liabilities in the balance sheet in accordance with FRS 26: Financial Instruments: Measurement.
g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates as at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities and equity investments held at fair value, denominated in foreign currencies at the year end, are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising on monetary assets from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments and loans arising from a change in exchange rates are included in Holding gains and losses on investments.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or recovered.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is allocated to capital.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 i Dividends In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are included in the accounts in the year in which they are approved by shareholders.
j Value added tax VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method, based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
k Performance fee Any performance fee falling due for payment immediately is included in Creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
Amounts which are carried forward for payment in future years but which are subject to reduction by any future underperformance are included in Provisions for liabilities and charges.
l Repurchases of Ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing Ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transaction costs is charged to Other reserve and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of Ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of called up share capital and into the capital redemption reserve.
m Conversion of Subscription shares When the holders of Subscription shares exercise their right to convert their shares into Ordinary shares, the nominal value of those Subscription shares is transferred to the credit of share premium.
The nominal value of the Ordinary shares into which the Subscription shares convert is credited to called up share capital and the balance of the consideration received is credited to share premium.

Taxation continued c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 2,125,000 2010: 1,021,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 26% 2010: 27%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 29th March 2011 and is effective from 1st April 2011.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% each year down to 23% by 1st April 2014.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise the following: investments in equity shares and participatory notes of overseas companies which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: derivative financial instruments including forward currency contracts: and multicurrency loan facilities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling the Companys functional currency and the currency in which the accounts are presented.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 30th September are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments which are not monetary items are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis in order to show the overall level of exposure.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys overseas income and monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% 2010: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the currencies to which the Company is exposed, which is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2011 2010 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 916 717 Capital return 1,363 1,726 Total return after taxation for the year 2,279 1,009 Net assets 2,279 1,009 Conversely if sterling had strengthened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2011 2010 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 916 717 Capital return 1,363 1,726 Total return after taxation for the year 2,279 1,009 Net assets 2,279 1,009 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities is broadly representative of the whole year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into other price risk sensitivity on page 56. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of interest receivable on cash deposits and the interest payable on the Companys variable rate cash borrowings.
Management of interest rate risk Liquidity and borrowings are managed with the aim of increasing returns to shareholders.
The Companys actual gearing range may fluctuate between 90% and 120%.
The possible effects on cash flows that could arise as a result of changes in interest rates are taken into account when the Company borrows on its loan facility.
However, amounts drawn down on this facility are for short term periods and therefore exposure to interest rate risk is not significant.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2011 2010 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates: Cash and short term deposits 20,570 31,496 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year bank loan 25,384 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year bank loan 8,345 19,038 Total exposure 12,225 12,926 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
The Company has an unsecured multicurrency loan facility with ING Bank which expires in September 2013.
Under the terms of this agreement, the Company may draw down up to 30 million, or its foreign currency equivalent, at an interest rate of LIBOR as offered in the market for the relevant currency and loan period plus a margin of 2.10% plus the Mandatory Costs Rate, which is the lenders cost of complying with certain regulatory requirements.
The most restrictive covenants for this facility state that the total borrowings of the Company are not to exceed 35% of the net asset value after deducting: a the amount by which the value of any single investment exceeds 5% of the total value of the assets of the Company: b 100% of the value of any unlisted investments: and c 100% of the market value of any listed investments which are listed on stock exchanges located in countries whose long term foreign currency Standard & Poors or equivalent ratings are either below BBB or are unrated.
Furthermore, the Company must ensure that its adjusted net assets do not fall below 150 million at any time.
At the year end, the Company had drawn down US$13.0 million 8.3 million on this facility at an interest rate of 2.47% and this amount is included in the balance sheet within Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year.
At 30th September 2010, the Company had drawn down US$30 million 19.0 million on this facility at an interest rate of 2.51%.
At 30th September 2010, the Company had also drawn down US$40 million 25.4 million on a facility with Lloyds Banking Group.
This facility expired in May 2011.
The exposure to floating interest rates has fluctuated during the year as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Maximum debit interest rate exposure to floating rates net loan balances 40,032 32,289 Maximum credit interest rate exposure to floating rates net cash balances 32,102 4,232 JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust plc.

This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 30th September comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 320,030 462,427 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on page 16.
This shows that the portfolio comprises investments quoted on Asian stockmarkets.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to that region.
However, it should be noted that an investment may not necessarily be wholly exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2010: 10% in the fair value of the Companys equities.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft facilities.
The Boards policy is to use borrowings from time to time to gear the portfolio within a range of 90% and 120% invested.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term liabilities and working capital requirements.
Bank loan facilities are used to gear the Company as appropriate.
Details of the current facility are given in part a ii to this note on page 55.
Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required by the lender are as follows: 2011 More than Three three months months but less than More than or less one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Securities purchased awaiting settlement 2,608 2,608 Other creditors and accruals 235 235 Forward currency contracts 4 4 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Bank loan including interest 52 155 8,746 8,953 2,899 155 8,746 11,800 JPMorgan Asian Investment Trust plc.

Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager regularly monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
Cash Counterparties are subject to daily credit analysis by the Manager and trades can only be placed with counterparties that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The custody agreement grants a general lien over the securities credited to the securities account.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given to investors on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and short term deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.
Cash and short term deposits comprises balances held at banks that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 2010: A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
In accordance with the Companys current policy, there has been no stock lending during the year, or prior year.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying amount in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys debt and capital structure comprises the following: 2011 2010 000 000 Debt Bank loan falling due within one year 25,384 Bank loan falling due after more than one year 8,345 19,038 8,345 44,422 Equity Share capital 42,196 44,371 Reserves 291,341 400,631 333,537 445,002 Total debt and equity capital 341,882 489,424 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and to maximise capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 90% to 120% invested.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
2011 2010 000 000 Investments 320,030 462,427 Net assets 333,537 445,002 Gearing 96.0% 103.9% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares for cancellation, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: and the need for issues of new shares.
