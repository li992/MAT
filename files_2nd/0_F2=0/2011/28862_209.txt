V. Group that are treated consistent with the local implementation of the Capital Requirements Directive including the transitional provisions of that Directive.
The FSA formally confirmed this treatment in 2012.
It is the Group's policy to maintain a strong capital base, to expand it as appropriate and to utilise it efficiently throughout its activities to optimise the return to shareholders while maintaining a prudent relationship between the capital base and the underlying risks of the business.
In carrying out this policy, the Group has regard to the supervisory requirements of the FSA.
The FSA uses risk asset ratio RAR as a measure of capital adequacy in the UK banking sector, comparing a bank's capital resources with its risk-weighted assets the assets and off-balance sheet exposures are weighted to reflect the inherent credit and other risks : by international agreement, the RAR should be not less than 8% with a Tier 1 component of not less than 4%.
The Group has complied with the FSAs capital requirements throughout the year.
A number of subsidiaries and sub-groups within the Group, principally banking and insurance entities, are subject to various individual regulatory capital requirements in the UK and overseas.
