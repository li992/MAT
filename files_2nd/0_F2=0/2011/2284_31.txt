After recognition of impairment losses, the carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2011 2010 m m ADE: Western Europe 26.7 26.8 North America 37.1 37.1 AGI: Western Europe 17.6 17.9 North America 15.2 15.2 Emerging Markets 6.0 10.7 102.6 107.7 The Group tests goodwill at least annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for those calculations are the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to cash generating units.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for cash generating units is 9.5% 2010: 9.5%.
This rate is risk adjusted, for specific countries, where the Group perceives a risk premium is appropriate.
A risk premium of 20% has been applied to the South American operations, and a risk premium of 10% has been applied to the far eastern operations.
The recoverable amount is the sum of the discounted cash flows over a fifteen year period, being management's expectation of the useful life of the existing asset base.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on management estimates for the next five years.
The expected sales reflect management's expectation of how sales will develop at this point in the economic cycle.
The expected profit margin reflects management's experience of each cash generating unit's profitability at the forecast level of sales and incorporates the impact of the restructuring programme, where appropriate.
Cash flows after five years are based on an estimated growth rate of 3.2% 2010: 3.2%, being the historical weighted average growth in GDP in the markets that the Group operates in.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each cash generating unit's carrying value.
A cut in the sales growth rate by 18.9% would result in the recoverable amount of goodwill for the Group being reduced to its carrying value.
The charge for impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets relates to the Groups South American operations.
Trading activity has lagged expectations, which together with an increase in the perceived risk-adjusted discount rate, has led to an impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible fixed assets.
With improved market conditions the Board has concluded that no other impairment charge is required in 2011.

The average credit period given to customers for the supply of services as at 31 December 2011 is 59 days 2010: 59 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the supply of services of 6.2m 2010: 6.9m.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Further disclosure of the Groups financial instrument risk management activities is set out in note 20.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 17.7m 2010: 16.7m which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The Group does not hold any collateral over these balances.
Other financial assets continued Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 2011 2010 m m Amounts overdue by up to 1 month 14.6 13.2 Amounts overdue by 12 months 1.8 2.2 Amounts overdue by 23 months 0.4 0.4 Amounts overdue by more than 3 months 0.9 0.9 17.7 16.7 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 2011 2010 m m Balance at 1 January 6.9 8.1 Impairment losses recognised 1.6 2.6 Amounts written off as uncollectable 0.4 2.2 Impairment losses reversed 1.6 1.5 Exchange differences 0.3 0.1 6.2 6.9 In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

The remaining borrowings are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Borrowings continued The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings as follows: 2011 2010 m m Bank overdrafts 8.6 5.9 Loans 8.7 67.8 The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: i Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
ii The Group has two principal borrowing facilities which are secured by upstream guarantees provided by subsidiaries: a Drawings of Nil 2010: Nil under a Revolving Credit Facility of 125m.
This unsecured facility commenced on 27 July 2011 and matures on 31 August 2016.
The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 1.15% and 2.00% above LIBOR the margin at 31 December 2011 was 1.15%.
b Drawings of 6.0m 2010: 64.4m under a Revolving Credit Facility of 125m.
This unsecured facility commenced on 31 July 2006 for a period of seven years.
The multi currency drawings under this facility carry an interest rate of between 0.80% and 1.10% above LIBOR the margin at 31 December 2011 was 0.80%.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had available 223.9m 2010: 160.9m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
All borrowings are classified as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.

The Group uses foreign currency forward contracts in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
The contracts are primarily denominated in the currencies of the Group's principal markets.
The unrecognised gains and losses were not significant in either 2011 or 2010.
In accordance with IFRS 7 Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments, the Groups financial instruments are considered to be classified as level 2 instruments.
Fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liabilities, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Fair value is determined using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
The Group's interest rate risk is primarily in relation to its fixed rate borrowings fair value risk and floating rate borrowings cash flow risk.
From time to time the Group will use interest rate derivative contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements within Group policy.
However at the balance sheet date the Group had no interest rate derivative contracts.

Derivative financial instruments continued Financial risk management The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk.
Treasury activities have the objective of minimising risk and treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and authorised by the Board.
The Group uses a number of derivative instruments that are transacted, for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
The use of financial instruments, including derivatives, is permitted when approved by the Board, where the effect is to minimise risk for the Group.
Speculative trading of derivatives or other financial instruments is not permitted.
There has been no significant change during the financial year, or since the end of the year, to the types or scope of financial risks faced by the Group.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined as the risk that the Group might not be able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price.
Liquidity risk arises as a result of mismatches between cash inflows and outflows from the business.
This risk is monitored on a centralised basis through regular cash flow forecasting, a three-year rolling strategic plan, an annual budget agreed by the Board each December and a quarterly re-forecast undertaken during the financial year.
To mitigate the risk, the resulting forecast net debt cash is measured against the liquidity headroom policy which, at the current net debt cash levels, requires committed facilities plus term loans in excess of one year to exceed net debt by 50% minimum facilities of 100m.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had revolving credit committed facilities of 229.9m 2010: 230.9m which exceeded net cash of 0.1m 2010: net debt of 51.3m by 230.0m 2010: 179.6m or 350%.
The Group also uses uncommitted short-term bank facilities to manage short-term liquidity but these facilities are excluded from the liquidity headroom policy.
The Group manages longer-term liquidity through committed bank facilities and will, if appropriate, raise funds on capital markets.
Following the completion of the 5 year 125m Revolving Credit and $10m Letter of Credit facilities on 27 July 2011, the Groups principal committed bank facilities have the following maturity dates: 125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 July 2013 1.6 years 125m Revolving Credit Facility 31 August 2016 4.7 years $10m Letter of Credit Facility 31 August 2016 4.7 years In addition, cash management pooling, netting and concentration techniques are used to minimise borrowings.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had gross cash of 18.1m 2010: 23.5m.
Interest rate risk Interest rate risk arises on borrowings and cash balances and derivative liabilities and assets which are at floating interest rates.
Changes in interest rates could have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the Groups net profit.
Under the Groups interest rate management policy, the interest rates on each of the Groups major currency monetary assets and liabilities are managed to achieve the desired mix of fixed and variable rates for each major net currency exposure.
The major interest rate risk is to UK rates but exposures also exist to rates in the USA, Europe and Sweden.
Measurement of this interest rate risk and its potential volatility to the Groups reported financial performance is undertaken on a monthly basis and the Board uses this information to determine, from time to time, an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rates.
As at 31 December 2011, 8% of gross debt and 0% of gross cash were at fixed rates 2010: 2% of gross debt, 0% of gross cash.
The average tenure of the fixed rate debt was 3.6 years 2010: 5.2 years.
Currency risk Bodycote has operations in 27 countries and is therefore exposed to foreign exchange translation risk when the profits and net assets of these entities are consolidated into the Group accounts.
Over 89% of the Groups sales are in currencies other than sterling EUR 38%, USD 27% and SEK 8%.
Cumulatively over the year, sterling rates moved such that the sales for the year were 2.6m better than if sales had been translated at the rates prevailing in 2010.
It is Group policy not to hedge exposure for the translation of reported profits.
The Groups balance sheet translation policy is not to actively hedge currency net assets.
However, where appropriate, the Group will still match centrally held currency borrowings to the net assets.
The Group principally borrows in sterling but also maintains debt in US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona, consistent with the location of the Groups assets.
The Group recognises foreign exchange movements in equity for the translation of net investment hedging instruments and balances.
Transaction foreign exchange exposures arise when entities within the Group enter into contracts to pay or receive funds in a currency different from the functional currency of the entity concerned.
It is Group policy to hedge exposure to cash transactions in foreign currencies when a commitment arises, usually through the use of foreign exchange forward contracts.
Even though approximately 89% of the Groups sales are generated outside the UK, the nature of the business is such that cross border sales and purchases are limited and, other than interest, such exposures are immaterial for the Group.
Market risk sensitivity analysis The Group has measured the estimated charge to the income statement and equity of either an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% 100 basis points in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in sterling against all other currencies from the applicable rates as at 31 December 2011, for all financial instruments with all other variables remaining constant.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only.
The sensitivity analysis excludes the impact of market risks on net post employment benefit obligations.
Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity The interest rate sensitivity analysis is based on the following assumptions: changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of variable interest financial instruments: changes in market interest rates only affect the income statement in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest if these are recognised at their fair value: and changes in market interest rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments.
Under these assumptions, a one percentage point fall or rise in market interest rates for all currencies in which the Group has variable net cash or net borrowings at 31 December 2011 would reduce or increase profit before tax by approximately 0.1m 2010: 0.5m.
There is no significant impact on equity.
Currency sensitivity Taking the 2011 sales by currency, a 10% weakening strengthening in the 2011 cumulative average rates for all currencies versus sterling would have given rise to a 56.8m -46.5m movement in sales respectively.
The impact on headline operating profit is affected by the mix of losses and profits in the various currencies.
However, taking the 2011 operating profit mix, a 10% weakening strengthening in 2011 cumulative average rates for all currencies would have given rise to a 9.9m -8.1m movement in headline operating profit.
Counterparty risk Counterparty risk encompasses settlement risk on derivative financial instruments and money market contracts and credit risk on cash, time deposits and money market funds.
The Group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties via their credit ratings where applicable and through its policy, thereby limiting its exposure to any one party to ensure there is no significant concentration of credit risk.
Group policy is to enter into such transactions only with counterparties with a long-term credit rating of AA3 or better.
However, acquired businesses occasionally have dealings with banks with lower credit ratings.
Business with such banks is moved as soon as practicable.

At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of 183.1m 2010: 208.0m available for offset against future profits.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 96.3m 2010: 101.0m of such losses, based on management forecasts of future taxable profits against which the assets can be recovered in the relevant jurisdictions.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 86.8m 2010: 107.0m of such losses where there remains uncertainty over the timing of utilisation relating to future profitability.
The majority of losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

The Group provides for the costs of environmental remediation that have been identified, either as part of acquisition due diligence, or in other circumstances where remediation by the Group is required.
This provision is reviewed annually and is separated into Restructuring Environmental and Environmental to separately identify environmental provisions relating to the restructuring programme from those arising in the ordinary course of business.
The increase in restructuring provisions is due to the ongoing implementation of the global restructuring initiatives.
In addition income of 0.1m was recognised following the disposal of non core assets associated with the restructuring plans.
The reversal of certain asset impairments of 0.6m was also recognised in relation to the ongoing restructuring.
Cash outflows in respect of these liabilities are expected to occur within 5 years.

Bodycote Incentive Plan BIP The Company operates the BIP under which Executive Directors and senior executives received a conditional award of Bodycote shares up to a maximum of 175% of base salary.
Vestings of awards are based upon two performance measures, over a three year period.
Fifty per cent of the award is subject to a return on capital employed ROCE performance condition and fifty per cent of the award is subject to an earnings per share EPS performance condition.
In the event that threshold performance for both EPS and ROCE is not achieved none of the conditional awards will vest.
Bodycote Co-investment Plan CIP The CIP permits executives to invest in shares up to a value equivalent to 40% of net basic salary.
The CIP provides for the grant of awards of matching shares to participants on an annual basis in a maximum ratio of 1:1 to the gross investment made in deferred shares.
Deferred shares must be held for three years and matching shares are subject to an absolute Total Shareholder Return TSR target.
The threshold target for CIP matching awards is TSR growth of not less than 4% per annum compound in excess of growth in the Consumer Prices Index CPI for a threshold matching ratio of 1:2.
10% per annum compound growth in excess of growth in the CPI will be required for a vesting matching ratio of 1:1.
