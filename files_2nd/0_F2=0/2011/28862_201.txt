Business projections prepared for impairment reviews see Note 17 indicate it is probable that sufficient future taxable income will be available against which to offset these recognised deferred tax assets within six years.
UK losses do not expire and Netherlands losses expire after nine years.
In jurisdictions where doubt exists over the availability of future taxable profits, deferred tax assets of 3,246 million 2010 - 2,008 million: 2009 - 2,163 million have not been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward of 16,691 million 2010 - 9,869 million: 2009 - 7,759 million.
Of these losses, none will expire within one year, 392 million within five years and 9,505 million thereafter.
The balance of tax losses carried forward has no time limit.
2 Deferred tax liabilities of 249 million 2010 and 2009 - 279 million have not been recognised in respect of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and held-over gains on the incorporation of overseas branches.
Retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries are expected to be reinvested indefinitely or remitted to the UK free from further tax.
No tax is expected to arise in the foreseeable future in respect of held-over gains.
Changes to UK tax legislation largely exempts overseas dividends received on or after 1 July 2009 from UK tax.
