Under the Companys Articles of Association, one third of the Directors are required to submit themselves for reelection every year.
This requirement has been superseded by the requirements of the Code which requires that all Directors offer themselves for reelection each year.
In accordance with the terms of the Code all Directors, as they did in 2011, will submit themselves for reelection at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting in June 2012.
