Allresults were based on unaudited management accounts prepared on a US GAAP basis.
The Group does not believe any differences of more than 10% to the figures below have subsequently been identified.
Revenue EBITDA Date acquired Period covered $m $m 16 September 2011 Six months to 30 June 2011 114.7 41.7 It should, however, be noted that these results occurred prior to acquisition and therefore they do not form part of the reported results for 2011.
