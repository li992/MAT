Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Group and parent financial statements have been prepared in accordance with those International Financial Reporting Standards including International Accounting Standards IASs and interpretations, collectively IFRS, published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB which have been adopted by the European Commission and endorsed for use in the EU for the purposes of the Groups full year financial statements.
The consolidated and company financial statements comply with the Gibraltar Companies Accounts Act 1999, the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999 and the Gibraltar Companies Act 1930 as amended.
Statutory accounts for the year ended 31 December 2011 will be filed with Companies House Gibraltar following the Companys Annual General Meeting.
Due to the Merger which was treated as an acquisition by PartyGaming for accounting purposes, certain accounting policies that were not previously relevant for the Group, but relevant for bwin, have been adopted in these consolidated financial statements pages.
All other material accountingpolicies and presentations of bwin have been aligned to those of the enlarged Group.
Functional currency of the parent company Reflecting the fact that the Company has hedged its remaining US dollar exposure, the effect of the Merger, and that going forward most transactions will be in pound sterling but funded by excess euros generated by the rest of the Group, the Company has changed its functional currency from US dollars to euros.
In line with IAS 21 the change took effect from the date the Company determined that the characteristics required to identify the functional currencyhad changed.
The Company determined this occurred during 2011 and for accounting purposes this is effective from 1 January 2011.
All financial data for the Company for prior periods has been converted using the exchange rate at 1 January 2011 of 1 euro US dollar 1.3416.
Adoption of new and revised Standards and Interpretations The following new and revised Standards and Interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, are effective for thefirst time in the current financial year and have been adopted by the Group with no effect on its consolidated results or financial position: IFRIC 14 Amended and Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction effective for annual periods IAS 19 Amended beginning on or after 1 January 2011.
The following relevant standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB or the IFRIC before the period end but are as yet not effective for the2011 year end: IAS 1 Amended Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive Income effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1July2012 IAS 12 Amended Deferred tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012 IAS 19 Amended Employee Benefits effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 27 Amended Separate Financial Statements effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 28 Amended Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2013 IAS 32 Amended Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2014 IFRS 7 Amended Disclosures Transfers of Financial Assets effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2011 IFRS 7 Amended Disclosures Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2013 IFRS 7 Amended Disclosures Initial application of IFRS 9 effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015.

Accounting policies continued Basis of accounting The consolidated and company financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention other than for the valuation of certain financial instruments.
Critical accounting policies, estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and judgements that affect the application of policies andreported amounts.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Included in this note are accounting policies which cover areas that the Directors consider require estimates, judgements and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
These policies, together with references to the related notes to the financial statements, can be found as follows: Functional currency note 1 Revenue recognition note 2 Intangible assets and impairment of goodwill note 10 Regulatory compliance, litigation and contingent liabilities note 23 Acquisition accounting and value of acquired assets and liabilities note 26 Provisions note 19 Tax including deferred tax note 7 Held for sale disposal groups note 8 Share-based payments note 29 Basis of consolidation Under section 10 2 of the Gibraltar Companies Consolidated Accounts Act 1999, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own statement of comprehensive income.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Accounting for the Companys acquisition of the controlling interest in PartyGaming Holdings Limited The Companys controlling interest in its directly held, wholly-owned subsidiary, PartyGaming Holdings Limited formerly Headwall Ventures Limited, was acquired through a transaction under common control, using a form of accounting that is similar to pooling of interests.
Accounting for subsidiaries A subsidiary is an entity controlled directly or indirectly by the Company.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On the date of acquisition the assets and liabilities of the relevant subsidiaries are measured at their fair values.
The non-controlling interest is stated at the non-controlling interests proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups equity therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination and the non-controlling shareholders share ofchanges in equity since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to non-controlling interests even if this results inthe non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Investments in subsidiaries held by the Company are carried at cost less any impairment in value.
party 112 Financials Annual report & accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Business combinations Acquisitions of subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control ofthe acquiree.
Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquirees identifiable assets and liabilities are recognised at their fair values at the acquisition date.
The interest of the non-controlling shareholders in the acquiree may initially be measured either at fair value or at the non-controlling shareholders proportion of the net fair value of the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed.
The choice of measurement basis ismade on an  basis.
Investments Investments include investments in associates, joint ventures and available-for-sale investments.
Availableforsale investments Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
They are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognised directly in equity.
In accordance with IAS39, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of an available-for-sale financial asset is recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Purchases and sales of available-for-sale financial assets are recognised on settlement date with any change in fair value between trade date and settlement date being recognised in the available-for-sale reserve.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in associates are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Losses of anassociate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate are not recognised.
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, onlytothe extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Investments in joint ventures A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby the Group and other parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control: that is, when the strategic financial and operating policy decisions relating to the activities require the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The Group reports its interests in jointly controlled entities using the equity method of accounting.
Under the equity method, investments in joint ventures are carried in the consolidated statement of financial position at cost as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the joint venture, less any impairment in the value of the investment.
Losses of a joint venture in excess of the Groups interest in that investment are not recognised.
Additional losses are provided for, and a liability is recognised, only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal orconstructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture.

Accounting policies continued Intangible assets Identifiable intangible assets are recognised when the Group controls the asset, it is probable that future economic benefits attributed to the asset will flow to the Group and the cost of the asset can be reliably measured.
Goodwill Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Groups previously held equity interest in the acquiree, if any, over the net amounts of identifiable assets acquired inthe subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.
For acquisitions where the agreement date is on or after 31 March 2004, goodwill is not amortised and is reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and is not subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on earlier acquisitions was being amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the unamortised balance of goodwill at 31 December 2004 was frozen and reviewed for impairment and will be reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Externally acquired intangible assets Intangible assets are recognised on business combinations if they are separate from the acquired entity or give rise to other contractual or legal rights.
Identifiable assets are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
The identified intangibles are amortised over the useful economic life of the assets.
Internally generated intangible assets research and development expenditure Expenditure incurred on development activities, including the Groups software development, is capitalised only where the expenditure will lead tonew or substantially improved products or processes, the products or processes are technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, labour and an appropriate proportion ofoverheads.
All other development expenditure is expensed as incurred.
Subsequent expenditure on capitalised intangible assets is capitalised only where it clearly increases the economic benefits to be derived from the asset to which it relates.
All other expenditure, including that incurred in order to maintain the related intangible assets current level of performance, is expensed as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets Amortisation is provided to write-off the cost of all intangible assets, with the exception of goodwill, over the periods the Group expects to benefit from their use, and varies between: Brand and domain names 5% to 20% per annum Broadcast libraries 50% per annum Capitalised development expenditure 20% to 33% per annum Contractual relationships over the length of the contract Customer lists and contracts 5% to 50% per annum Intellectual property and gaming licences over the length of the licence Software 20% to 33% per annum bwin.
party 114 Financials Annual report & accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Impairment of goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment At the end of each reporting year, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its goodwill, other intangibles and property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cashflows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cashflows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless the relevant asset iscarried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of itsrecoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had noimpairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Impairments related to goodwill are not reversed.
Property, plant and equipment All property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, with the exception of freehold land and buildings which are stated at cost and are not depreciated due to immateriality.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss.
Cost includes directly attributable costs incurred in bringing the assets to working condition for their intended use, including professional fees.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready fortheir intended use.
Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment with the exception of freehold landand buildings, evenly over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated at the following rates: Leasehold improvements over length of lease Plant, machinery, computer equipment 33% per annum Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment, vehicles 20% per annum Where an item of property, plant or equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised where it is incurred to replace a component of an item of plant, property or equipment where that item isaccounted for separately including major inspection and overhaul.
All other subsequent expenditure is expensed as incurred, unless it increases the future economic benefits to be derived from that item of plant, property and equipment.

Accounting policies continued Segment information An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses.
Eachsegments operating results are regularly reviewed by the Group to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assessits performance.
The method for determining what information to report is based on the way management organises the operating segmentswithin the Group for decision-making purposes and for the assessment of financial performance.
The Group reviews financial statements presented by product type which are supplemented by some information about geographic regions for the purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.
Therefore, the Group has determined that it is appropriate to report according to product segment.
Revenue Revenue from online gaming, comprising sports betting, casino and games, poker, bingo, and network services third-party entities that use the Groups platform and certain services, as well as fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions, is recognised in the accounting periods in which the gaming transactions occur.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and is net of certain promotional bonuses and the value of loyalty points accrued.
Net revenue consists of net gaming revenue and revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals andaccount fees.
Poker net revenue represents the commission charged or tournament entry fees where the player has concluded his or her participation in the tournament.
Casino, bingo and sports betting net revenue represents net house win adjusted for the fair market value of gains and losses on open betting positions.
Revenue generated from foreign exchange commissions on customer deposits and withdrawals and account fees is allocated to each reporting segment.
Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from network services, third-party payment services, sale of domain names, financial markets and fees from broadcasting, hosting and subscriptions.
Revenue in respect of network service arrangements where the third-party owns the relationship with the customer is the net commission invoiced.
Interest income is recognised on an accruals basis.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists primarily of betting and gaming taxes and broadcasting costs.
Broadcasting costs are expensed over the applicable life cycle of each programme based upon the ratio of the current years revenue to the estimated remaining total revenues.
Other operating income Other operating income consists primarily of exchange gains.
Other operating expenses Other operating expenses consist primarily of exchange losses and merger and acquisition expenses and are recognised on an accruals basis.
party 116 Financials Annual report & accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Foreign currency Transactions entered into by Group entities in a currency other than the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate their functional currency are recorded at the rates ruling when the transactions occur.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated atthe rates ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of unsettled monetary assets and liabilities arerecognised immediately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, except for foreign currency borrowings qualifying as a hedge of anet investment in a foreign operation, in which case exchange differences are recognised in a separate component of equity.
On consolidation, the results of overseas operations are translated into euros at rates approximating to those ruling when the transactions took place.
All assets and liabilities of overseas operations, including goodwill arising on the acquisition of those operations, are translated at the rate ruling at the end of the reporting year.
Exchange differences arising on translating the opening net assets at opening rate and the results of overseas operations at actual rate are recognised directly in equity the currency reserve.
Exchange differences recognised in the statement of comprehensive income of Group entities separate financial statements on the translation of long-term monetary items forming part of the Groups net investment in the overseas operation concerned are reclassified to the currency reserve on consolidation.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the cumulative exchange differences recognised in the foreign exchange reserve relating to that operation uptothe date of disposal are transferred to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income as part of the profit or loss on disposal.

Taxation Income tax expense represents the sum of the Directors best estimate of taxation exposures and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted bythe end of the reporting year.

Accounting policies continued Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
It is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences other than where IAS 12 Income Taxes contains specific exemptions.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting year and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to profit or loss, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Assets held for sale Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if the carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use.
This condition is regarded as being met only when the sale is highly probable, management is committed to a sale plan, the asset is available for immediate sale in its present condition and the sale is expected to be completed within one year from the date of classification.
These assets are measured at the lower of carrying value and fair value less associated costs of sale.
Sharebased payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period and based, for those share options which contain only non-market vesting conditions, on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a suitable option pricing model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For cash-settled share-based payment transactions, the goods or services received and the liability incurred are measured at the fair value of theliability.
Up to the point at which the liability is settled, the fair value of the liability is re-measured at each reporting date and at the date of settlement, with changes being recorded in consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
The Group records the expense based on the fair value of the share-based payments on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For cash payments made by parties related to Principal Shareholders, the charge is recorded when there is a commitment to make the payment.
Where equity instruments of the parent company or a subsidiary are transferred, or cash payments based on the Companys or a subsidiarys share price are made, by shareholder s or entities that are effectively controlled by one or more shareholder s, the transaction is accounted for as a share-based payment, unless the transfer or payment is clearly for a purpose other than payment for goods or services supplied to the Group.
Where equity instruments are transferred by one or more shareholder s, the amount recorded in reserves is included in the share-based payment reserve.
Where a cash payment is made, this is recorded as a capital contribution.
party 118 Financials Annual report & accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued Treasury shares Treasury shares relate to shares gifted to the Employee Trust by the Company and to shares repurchased as part of the share buyback programme.
The cost of treasury shares creates an own share reserve.
When options issued by the Employee Trust are exercised the own share reserve is reduced and a gain or loss is recognised in reserves based onproceeds less weighted-average cost of shares exercised.
Own shares repurchased for the share buyback programme are carried at cost.
Provisions and contingent liabilities The Group recognises a provision in the consolidated statement of financial position when it has a legal or constructive obligation as a result ofapast event and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Where the Group has a possible obligation as a result of a past event that may, but probably will not, result in an outflow of economic benefits, noprovision is made.
Disclosures are made of the contingent liability including, where practicable, an estimate of the financial effect, uncertainties relating to the amount or timing of outflow of resources, and the possibility of any reimbursement.
Where time value is material, the amount of the related provision is calculated by discounting the cashflows at a pre-tax rate that reflects market assessments of the time value of money and any risks specific to the liability.
Leased assets Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Allother leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the consolidated statement of financial position as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation soas to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged directly to the consolidated statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over theterm of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to manage currency cashflows and to hedge foreign exchange risk on non-US dollar denominated financial assets and liabilities.
The derivative instruments used by the Group consist mainly of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised in the statement of financial position at fair value calculated using either discounted cashflow techniques or by reference to market prices supplied by banks.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

Accounting policies continued Financial assets The Groups financial assets which are financial instruments are categorised as loans, receivables and available-for-sale financial assets.
These include restricted cash and unrestricted bank deposits with maturities of more than three months.
Amounts held as security deposits are considered to be restricted cash.
There are no financial assets that are classified as held to maturity.
A category for in the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments held as at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
Non-derivative financial assets classified as available-for-sale comprise the Groups strategic investments in entities not qualifying as subsidiaries, associates or jointly controlled entities.
On sale, the amount held in the available-for-sale reserve associated with that asset is removed from equity and recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.
Short-term investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted on an active market.
They are initially recognised at fair value, plus transaction costs directly attributable to their acquisition or issue.
They are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any provisions for impairment.
Trade and other receivables represent short-term monetary assets which are recognised at fair value less impairment and other related provisions, which are recognised when there is objective evidence primarily default or significant delay in payment that the Group will be unable to collect all ofthe amounts due.
The amount of such a provision is the difference between the net carrying amount and the present value of the future expected cashflows associated with the impaired receivable.
Cash comprises cash in hand and balances with financial institutions.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash.
They include unrestricted short-term bank deposits originally purchased with maturities of three months orless.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities are all categorised as financial liabilities measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities include the following items: Client liabilities, including amounts due to progressive prize pools.
Trade payables and other short-term monetary liabilities which are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, which ensures that interest expense over the period to repayment is at a constant rate on the balance ofthe liability carried in the Consolidated statement of financial position.
Loans and borrowings, comprising bank borrowings and overdrafts, which are initially recognised at fair value, net of any transaction costs directly attributable to the issue of the instrument.
Such interest-bearing liabilities are subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Interest expense in this context includes initial transaction costs, as well as any interest or coupon payable while the liability is outstanding.
A category for out of the money derivative financial instruments was not required since there were no derivative financial instruments asat31December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
Share capital Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they do not meet the definition of a financial liability.
TheGroups ordinary shares are classified as equity instruments.
Dividends Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable.
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this is when declared bytheDirectors.
In the case of final dividends, this is when approved by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.

Segment information For management purposes and transacting with customers, the Groups operations can be segmented into the following reporting segments: sports betting, casino & games, poker, bingo and unallocated corporate including World Poker Tour, InterTrader.
com and the payment services business.
These segments are the basis upon which the Group currently reports its segment information.
Unallocated corporate expenses, assets and liabilities relate to the Group as a whole and are not allocated to individual segments.
The measure of reporting segment performance is Clean EBITDA and the basis for arriving at this is the same as the Group accounts.
Following the acquisition of bwin a review is currently being undertaken of the need to change the Groups reporting of results to the Chief Operating Decision Makers CODMs which could have a consequential effect on the reporting of segmental information under IFRS 8.

Factors affecting the tax charge for the period The Groups policy is to manage, control and operate Group companies only in the countries in which they are registered.
At the period end there were Group companies registered in 24 countries including Gibraltar.
However, the rules and practice governing the taxation of eCommerce activity are evolving in many countries.
It is possible that the amount of tax that will eventually become payable may differ from the amount provided in the financial information.
Factors that may affect future tax charges As the Group is involved in worldwide operations, future tax charges will be affected by the levels and mix of profitability in different jurisdictions.
Future tax charges will be reduced by a deferred tax credit in respect of amortisation of certain acquired intangibles.

Following the Merger, management have amended their performance measure to also add back exchange differences and amortisation and impairments on acquisitions, which they believe better reflects the underlying performance of the business and assists in providing a clearer view of the fundamental performance of the Group.

Intangible assets continued Acquired intangible assets are those intangible assets purchased as part of an acquisition and primarily include customer lists, brands, software andbroadcast libraries.
The value of acquired intangibles is based on cashflow projections at the time of acquisition.
Customer lists from existing customers take into account the expected impact of player attrition.
Other intangibles primarily include development expenditure, long-term gaming and intellectual property licences and purchased domain names.
Development expenditure represents software infrastructure assets that have been developed and generated internally.
Licences are amortised over the life of the licences and other intangibles are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of between three and five years.
During 2010, both contingent consideration, and consequently goodwill, were subsequently revised down by 3.7m based on Cashcades profit performance in 2010 which was in the middle of the target range for the earnout.
The 15.3m impairment of acquired intangibles in 2011 relates to software acquired as part of the Merger that will not be used for its normal economic life.
Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to the following cash-generating units CGUs : 2011 2010 As at 31 December million million PartyPoker 7.0 6.4 Gamebookers 66.7 64.5 EOL IOG 26.1 26.1 Cashcade 66.6 64.5 bwin 81.1 At end of year 247.5 161.5 Impairment In accordance with IAS 36, the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its intangible assets.
A detailed review was undertaken at 31 December 2011 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cashflows derived from those assets.
PartyPoker and Cashcade In respect of the PartyPoker and Cashcade CGUs, the Directors have concluded that there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.
EOL IOG The recoverable amount of EOL IOG has been determined with reference to the contribution the CGU makes towards the overall casino vertical.
TheDirectors have concluded therefore that there are no reasons which would cause the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles to exceed their value in use.
Gamebookers The recoverable amount of Gamebookers has been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering the following ten year period.
The Group believes that going beyond five years cashflows in the value in use calculations is appropriate given the Group is an established business and is a leader in a growth industry.
The projections include the formally approved budget for 2012 and a detailed forecast for2013.

The accounting for this resulted in the recognition of goodwill at the time of the Merger measured as the difference in value between the consideration and the fair value of the separately identified assets and liabilities of bwin.
The consideration was measured using the PartyGaming share price at the time of the Merger and before proposed regulatory changes were announced one week later, which resulted in a substantial reduction in the Companys share price.
Had the merger completed one week later, no such impairment would have been required.
The uncertainty created by the proposed regulatory changes in Europe, particularly those in Germany, have resulted in the Directors applying probability weighted forecasts to determine the cashflow projections for this CGU.
This has had an adverse effect on the projected value in use ofthisoperation and consequently resulted in an impairment to goodwill of 391.7m.
The recoverable amount of bwin has been determined from value in use calculations based on cashflow projections covering the following ten year period.

As part of the Boards ongoing regulatory compliance process, the Board continues to monitor legal and regulatory developments and their potential impact on the business and takes appropriate advice in respect of these developments.
Litigation As a consequence of the as yet non-harmonised regulatory environment for online gaming in Europe, a number of civil and administrative proceedings are pending against the Group and or its board members in several countries including but not limited to Germany, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain aimed at preventing bwin.
party from offering its services in these countries.
Further, there are criminal investigations pending against certain board members of the Group for the alleged violation of local gaming laws such as in France and Austria.
In 2010, a former bwin subsidiary has been assessed by Austrian tax authorities to have value-added tax arrears of 6.4m for the years 2002 to 2004.
The Company has appealed the assessments.
Applying the same assessments to periods subsequent to 2004, although some circumstances have changed, the value of the worst case scenario amounts to 170.4m.
In 2006, the Portuguese monopoly operator Santa Casa fide Misericrdia da Lisboa and the Portuguese Casino Association, in addition to a request fora cease and desist order, filed a suit for damages in the amount of approximately 27m for the alleged loss of profits due to bwin.
partys Portuguese online gaming offer.
In September 2011, the Court of First Instance, amongst others, i declared the already terminated sponsorship agreement between the former bwin and the Portuguese Soccer League LPFP as well as bwins gaming offer and advertising measures as illegal inPortugal, and ii prohibited the offer of mutual bets and lottery games on bwin.
com and future advertising activities for bwin.
party filed an appeal against the Courts decision.
The Court did not yet decide on Santa Casas request for damages but reserved this for the further proceedings.
In 2010, the Justice and Public Safety Cabinet of the Commonwealth of Kentucky filed a civil suit against the Company and other defendants in Franklin Circuit Court, a state court in Kentucky in the US.
The suit seeks a claim for damages of US$47m along with interest and costs in relation tothe Companys activities from 5 August 2005 until the Companys termination of US-facing activities on 13 October 2006.
In 2011, Ante5 filed a complaint and a request for arbitration with Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service Inc. against the Company for the alleged breach of its obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement for the purchase of the World Poker Tour.
Under the Asset Purchase Agreement Ante5 isentitled to a 5% share of WPTs revenues since the acquisition in 2009.
Ante5 claims that the Company has not invested sufficient effort to market the WPT assets and has thus suffered loss in its revenue share.
Ante5 seeks recovery of the revenue that it believes it would have received were the Company to have acted diligently in the promotion of the WPT assets.
Ante 5 believes the sums due to it to be US$240m.
The Directors believe these suits to be without merit and intend to defend these matters vigorously and accordingly no provision has been made inthe accounts other than that set out in note 19.
In respect of the above matters relating to former bwin companies, IFRS 3 requires that a probability-weighted estimate is used for fair-valuing acquired contingent liabilities and a provision made accordingly, even though had the same contingent liability arisen in a former PartyGaming company no provision would be made under IAS 37.
Details of amounts provided for litigation and regulatory disputes can be found in note 19.
Nofurther details have been provided as the Directors consider that this would be prejudicial to the interests of the Group.

Acquisitions during the period On 31 March 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the voting equity instruments of bwin Interactive Entertainment AG, an exclusively non-US facing business whose principal activities are the provision of online gaming, providing online sporting content such as live video streams, live scores, statistics and SMS services to its customers and a payment service provider.
The main drivers for the Merger were the potential synergies that could be achieved.
There was no cash consideration as the acquisition was made on the basis of issuing 12.23 PartyGaming Plc shares for each bwin share together with an equivalent multiple of PartyGaming options for unexercised bwin options at that date.
Details of the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, purchase consideration and goodwill are as follows: million Noncurrent assets Intangible assets other than goodwill 608.7 Property, plant and equipment 19.3 Investments 9.0 637.0 Current assets Inventories 0.5 Trade and other receivables 72.7 Short-term investments 30.6 Cash and cash equivalents 157.9 261.7 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 85.1 Income taxes payable 12.3 Client liabilities and progressive prize pools 83.5 Provisions 9.3 190.2 Noncurrent liabilities Provisions 80.9 Deferred tax 71.2 152.1 Net assets acquired 556.4 Less: non-controlling interests 1.6 558.0 Goodwill 472.1 Consideration 1,030.1 Issue of 439,209,325 ordinary shares at 1.934 968.0 Issue of 34,772,933 share options 62.1 Consideration 1,030.1 bwin.

Acquisitions during the period continued The fair value adjustments included in the above relate primarily to the attribution of fair values to brands, customer lists and software acquired aspart of the acquisition, and the effect of deferred tax thereon.
These intangible assets are being amortised over their estimated useful economic lives of up to 20 years.
The amount included in provisions represents the Directors current best estimate of amounts payable based on probability-weighted expected values after the effects of discounting as required under IFRS 3.
The main factors leading to the recognition of goodwill none of which is deductible for tax purposes are the growth and revenue synergies created by combining business activities, cost savings of the merged operations and expertise of the workforce.
Merger and acquisition costs in the period in respect of this can be found in note 4.
Had the Merger taken place at the beginning of the period, total revenue would have been 830.1m of which 14.1m relates todiscontinued operations and loss after tax would have been 422.3m of which 21.1m relates to discontinued operations.

Financial instruments and risk management In common with all other businesses, the Group is exposed to risks that arise from its use of financial instruments.
This note describes the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and the methods used to measure them.
Further quantitative information in respect ofthese risks is presented throughout these financial statements.
There have been no substantive changes in the Groups exposure to financial instrument risks, its objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks or the methods used to measure them from previous periods, unless otherwise stated in this note.
Principal financial instruments The principal financial instruments used by the Group, from which financial instrument risk arises, are as follows: investments: short-term investments: trade and other receivables: cash and cash equivalents: loans and borrowings: trade and other payables: client liabilities and progressive prize pools: and foreign exchange contracts Foreign exchange contracts are regularly used in the normal course of business but none were outstanding as at 31 December 2011 or at the prior year end.
The Group operates a sports betting business and always has open bets.
As at 31 December 2011 and at the prior year end the fair market value of open bets was not material.
Other financial derivative instruments are permitted to be used by the Group, but none were used in the periodended 31 December 2011 or in the prior year.
Management controls and procedures The Board has overall responsibility for the determination of the Groups risk management objectives and policies and, whilst retaining  for them, it has delegated the authority for designing and operating the required processes that ensure the effective implementation of the objectives and policies to the Groups treasury department under the auspices of the Group Treasury Committee see below.
As such, theGroups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks are managed by the Groups treasury department.
The treasury department is mandated to execute conventional forward foreign exchange contracts and swaps in order to manage these underlying risks.
No other derivatives may be executed without written authority from the Board at which point an explanation of the accounting implications would also be given.
Treasury operations are conducted within a framework of policies and guidelines reviewed and approved by the Board on an annual basis which arerecommended and subsequently monitored by the Group Treasury Committee.
The Group Treasury Committee is chaired by the Group Finance Director.
These polices include benchmark exposures and hedge cover levels for key areas of treasury risk.
The Group risk management policies would also be reviewed by the Board following, for example, significant changes to the Groups business.
Exposures are monitored and reported tomanagement on a monthly basis, together with required actions when tolerance limits are exceeded.
The internal control procedures and risk management processes of the treasury department are also reviewed periodically by the internal audit function.
The last internal control review wasundertaken during 2011 and the procedures and processes were deemed satisfactory.
The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible, without unduly affecting the Groups competitiveness and flexibility.
Further details regarding these policies are set out below: bwin.
party 143 Overview 02 Annual report & accounts 2011 Strategy 20 Review of 2011 32 Markets and risks 47 Responsibility and relationships 58 Governance 70 Financial statements 103 28.
Financial instruments and risk management continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Groups management of its working capital as well as the finance charges and principal repayments on its debt instruments.
In essence, it is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting its financial obligations as they fall due.
The Groups treasury department ensures that the Groups cash and cash equivalents, and amounts due from payment service providers PSPs exceed its combined client liabilities at all times.
This excess is defined as the Client Liability Cover.
Client liabilities principally represent customer deposits and progressive prize pools.
The Group Treasury Committee is advised of cash balances, investments, foreign currency exposures, interest income, interest expense, amounts duefrom PSPs, Client Liability Cover and counterparty exposures on a monthly basis, or more frequently if required.
The Group imposes a maximum debt limit of 300m that may mature in any one year to ensure that there is no significant concentration ofrefinancing risk.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
During 2009 the Group entered into 35m term loan as a means of managing liquidity risk.
33.2m was outstanding on the term loan at the end ofDecember 2011 and it is fully repayable in December 2012.
Capital risk In common with many internet companies that have few physical assets, the Group has no policy as to the level of equity capital and reserves other than to address statutory requirements.
The primary capital risk to the Group is the level of debt relative to the Groups net income.
Accordingly, theGroups policy is that gross debt should not exceed 500m and that the leverage ratio of gross debt clean EBITDA should be less than 1.5x.
Ananalysis of gross debt is as follows: 2011 2010 As at 31 December million million Gross debt million 33.2 40.0 Clean EBITDA million 155.2 94.0 Headroom million 232.8 141.0 Ratio 0.1 0.3 Details of the Groups dividend policy is disclosed in the Chairmans statement and also on pages 154 to 156 of this Annual report.
Credit risk Operational: The Groups operational credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from PSPs and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
Prior to accepting new PSPs and wherever practicable, credit checks are performed using a reputable external source.
Senior management monitors PSP balances on a weekly basis and promptly takes corrective action if pre-agreed limits are exceeded.
For PSPs that do not have a formal credit rating, an internal rating system is used, based on such factors as industry knowledge, their statement of financial position, profitability, customer diversification, geographic diversification, long-term stability, management credibility, potential regulatory risk and historic payment track record.
These internal ratings are monitored and reviewed on a quarterly basis.
An internal rating of one is assessed as very strong whilst a rating of five isassessed as weak.
2011 2010 As at 31 December million million 1 Very Strong 42.5 3.7 2 Strong 12.3 11.8 3 Good 4.7 8.1 4 Satisfactory 2.7 0.0 PSPs amounts due 62.2 23.6 Management consider the maximum credit exposure on amounts due from PSPs to be the carrying amount.
party 144 Financials Annual report & accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 28.
Financial instruments and risk management continued As at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, there were no overdue amounts due from PSPs which had not been impaired, nor were there any partially impaired amounts.
There is an inherent concentration of risk with PSPs, which are not investment grade banks, in that the majority derive most of their income from the online gaming sector.
To this end, where practicable and economic, the Group seeks to substitute non-investment grade PSPs with investment grade, or, at least, better quality PSPs.
The table below sets out the movement in the impairment of amounts due from PSPs.
2011 2010 As at 31 December million million Impairments 0.0 0.1 Total impairment expense 0.0 0.1 Note 14 details the movement and level of provisions for PSPs.
Cash investments: As a result of the deteriorating European financial situation, in October 2011 the Group decided to only invest cash with banks onan overnight basis with a small number of very strong German and British financial institutions.
The Group also invests cash in instant access pooledmoney market funds with a minimum long-term credit rating of AAA on the principal, as defined by Moodys rating agency.
The Group can alsopurchase commercial paper provided the issuer is not a financial institution and has a one year credit default swap, as quoted by Bloomberg, ofno more than 1%.
Investments are allowed only in highly liquid securities.
The Group maintains monthly operational balances with strong local banks in Israel, Bulgaria, Austria, USA and India to meet local salaries, expenses and legal requirements.
In Austria, cash balances are also maintained to process andreceive customer and affiliate payments.
In Italy and France the Group maintains domestic segregated player funds accounts as required by therespective regulatory authorities.
Cash is also held as security in Austria, Italy and UK primarily to support bank guarantees and as reserves forcredit and debit card chargebacks.
Other than this, non-central cash balances are kept to a minimum.
Cash and cash equivalents Shortterm investments 2011 2010 2011 2010 As at 31 December million million million million AAA money market funds 84.7 144.3 0.0 0.0 Cash with banks 165.6 49.3 39.7 3.1 Commercial paper 38.7 0.0 0.0 0.0 289.0 193.6 39.7 3.1 The treasury department may only make the following cash investments, without prior written authority by the Board: overnight cash deposits: pooled money market funds: certificates of deposit: and commercial paper The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the statement of financial position.
Market risk Market risk arises from the Groups use of interest-bearing, tradable and foreign currency financial instruments.
It is the risk that the fair value of future cashflows on its long-term debt finance and cash investments through the use of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes ininterest rates, foreign exchange rates or other market factors.
Interest rate risk The Groups current net cash position is maintained primarily on a floating basis.
In the event of a strategic change in the debt position of the Group, the interest rate management policy would be reviewed.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Currency risk Transaction and currency liability exposures: The Groups policy is that all material transaction and currency liability exposures are economically andfully hedged using foreign exchange contracts and or by holding cash in the relevant currency.
Additionally, the Group has discretion to hedge some or all of its forecast sterling operational costs in Gibraltar and the UK for up to 12 months.
No other forecast cashflows are hedged.
The Group may also economically hedge material committed exposures such as capital expenditure unless the period between commitment and payment is short less than one month.
Currency exposures are monitored by the Group Treasury Committee on a monthly basis.
A 5m currency tolerance limit between euros and any other currency is permitted in order to avoid executing low value and uneconomic foreign exchange contracts.
Net investment exposures: The Group has the flexibility to hold debt in currencies other than euros in order to hedge non-euro investments up to 50%of the net investment value.
In managing the mix of ongoing debt exposure the Group takes into account prevailing interest rates in particular currencies and the potential impact on Group earnings ratios.
Sensitivity analysis to currency and interest rate risk The Group has adopted a sensitivity analysis that measures the change to the fair value of the Groups financial instruments and any resultant impact on the Groups earnings of either: an instantaneous increase or decrease of 1% in market interest rates including the annualised interest income impact of variable rate interest-bearing financial instruments, or a 10% strengthening or weakening in the reporting currency against all other currencies from the rates applicable at 31 December The Group is exposed to interest rate movements since it holds significant amounts of cash at floating rates as well as cash equivalents to meet clientliability obligations that are non-interest-bearing.
The Group is exposed to currency movements in the euro, arising out of changes in the fairvalue of financial instruments which are held in non-euro currencies.
This analysis is for illustrative purposes only, as in practice, market rates rarely change in isolation.
The amounts generated from the sensitivity analysis are estimates of the possible impact of market risk, assuming that specified changes occur.
Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to other developments in financial markets that may cause fluctuations ininterest and exchange rates to vary from the hypothetical amounts disclosed in the following table, which therefore should not be considered asaprojection of likely future events and losses.
