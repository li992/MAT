Risk Management and Financial Instruments Financial instruments The Companys financial instruments mainly comprise its investment portfolio as shown on page 10 and debentures as well as its cash, debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations such as sales and purchases awaiting settlement and accrued income.
The accounting policies in note 1 include criteria for the recognition and the basis of measurement applied for financial instruments.
Note 1 also includes the basis on which income and expenses arising from financial assets and liabilities are recognised and measured.
The principal risks that an investment company faces in its portfolio management activities are set out below: Market risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market prices.
Market risk comprises three types of risk: currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk: Currency risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in foreign exchange rates: Interest rate risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument because of changes in market interest rates: and Other price risk arising from fluctuations in the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument for reasons other than changes in foreign exchange rates or market interest rates.
Liquidity risk arising from any difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Credit risk arising from financial loss for a company where the other party to a financial instrument fails to discharge an obligation.
Risk Management Policies and Procedures The Directors have delegated to the Manager the responsibility for the day-to-day investment activities and management of gearing of the Company as more fully described in the Report of the Directors.
As an investment trust the Company invests in equities and other investments for the long-term so as to meet its investment policy incorporating the Companys investment objective.
In pursuing its investment objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of the profits available for dividends.
These policies are summarised below and have remained substantially unchanged for the two years under review.
Market Risk The Companys Manager assesses the Companys exposure when making each investment decision, and monitors the overall level of market risk for the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
The Board meets at least quarterly to assess risk and review investment performance, as disclosed in the Board Responsibilities on page 29.
The debentures provide structural gearing which is used to enhance returns, however, this will also increase the Companys exposure to market risk and volatility.
Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and all of its liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Forward currency contracts may be entered into for hedging purposes however, none were held during the 221274 Invesco Edin pp39-pp51 13 06 2011 11:30 Page 49 THE EDINBURGH INVESTMENT TRUST PLC 49 year or at the year end.
All contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure of those currencies.
The Company may invest up to 15% of the portfolio in securities listed on non-UK stock exchanges.
At the year end holdings of non-UK securities total 162.0 million 2010: 102.1 million representing 14.9% 2010: 10% of the portfolio.
If sterling had weakened by 3.2% for US dollar and 4.0% for Swiss franc during the year, the income statement capital return and net assets of the Company would have increased by 5.6 million 2010: 3.9 million.
Conversely, if sterling had strengthened by the same percentage for the currencies mentioned above, the capital return and net assets of the Company would have decreased by the same amount.
The exchange rate variances of 3.2% for US dollar and 4.0% for Swiss francs 2010: 3.9% and 3.1 respectively have been determined based on market volatility in the year, using the standard deviation of sterlings fluctuation to the applicable currency.
Interest rate risk Interest rate movements will affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and money market funds, and the interest payable on variable rate borrowings.
When the Company has cash balances, they are held on variable rate bank accounts yielding rates of interest dependent on the base rate determined by the Custodian, The Bank of New York Mellon.
The Company has an uncommitted bank overdraft facility which it uses for settlement purposes.
This facility has not been used during the year.
All of the Companys long term debt of 200 million of debenture stocks is fixed which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
Details of the debenture stock interest is shown in note 12, with details of its market value and the affect on net asset value in note 16.
The Company can invest in fixed income securities although at the year end none were held 2010: nil.
Interest rate exposure At 31 March the exposure of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to: floating interest rates giving cash flow interest rate risk - when the interest rate is due to be re-set: and fixed interest rates giving fair value interest rate risk - when the financial instrument is due for repayment.

Risk Management and Financial Instruments continued Other price risk Other price risks i. e. changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk may affect the value of the equity investments, but it is the business of the Manager to manage the portfolio to achieve the best return that he can.
Management of the other price risk The Directors manage the market price risks inherent in the investment portfolio by meeting regularly to monitor on a formal basis the Managers compliance with the Companys stated objectives and policies and to review investment performance.
The Companys portfolio is the result of the Managers investment process and need not be highly correlated with the Companys benchmark or the market in which the Company invests.
The value of the portfolio will not move in line with the market but will move as a result of the performance of the company shares within the portfolio.
If the value of the portfolio fell by 10% at the balance sheet date, the profit after tax for the year and the net assets of the Company would decrease by 109 million 2010: 102 million.
Conversely, if the value of the portfolio rose by 10%, the profit after tax and the net assets of the Company would increase by the 109 million 2010: 102 million.
Liquidity risk is minimised as the majority of the Companys investments comprise a diversified portfolio of readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments as necessary.
In addition, the Company has an overdraft facility which it can use to provide short-term funding flexibility.
Credit risk encompasses the failure by counterparties to deliver securities which the Company has paid for, or to pay for securities which the Company has delivered, and cash balances.
Counterparty risk is minimised by using only approved counterparties.
The Companys ability to operate in the shortterm may be adversely affected if the Companys custodian suffers insolvency or other financial difficulties.
The Board reviews the custodians annual controls report and the Managers management of the relationship with the custodian.
Cash balances are limited to a maximum of 5 million with any one depository, with only approved depositories being used, and a maximum deposit of 75 million with AIM Short-Term Investments Company Global Series plc, a triple-A rated money market fund.
Values of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities The values of the financial assets and financial liabilities are carried in the balance sheet at their fair value investments, or the balance sheet amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable, accrued income, amounts due to brokers, accruals and cash or at amortised cost debentures.
The book cost and fair value of the debentures, based on the midmarket value at the balance sheet date, are as follows: BOOK FAIR BOOK FAIR VALUE VALUE VALUE VALUE 2011 2011 2010 2010 000 000 000 000 Debentures repayable between one and five years: 1 11 2% Debenture Stock 2014 100,000 124,081 100,000 126,136 Debentures repayable in more than five years: 3 7 4% Debenture Stock 2022 100,000 120,102 100,000 119,690 Discount on issue of debentures 2,888 3,141........................................................................... 197,112 244,183 196,859 245,826 Incorporating the fair value of the debentures results in the reduction of the net asset value per ordinary share to 434.02p 2010: 398.92p.
