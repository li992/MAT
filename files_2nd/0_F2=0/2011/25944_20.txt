Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st October 2011 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis.
In particular, in determining that the going concern basis is appropriate, the Directors have considered the continuation vote to be proposed to the shareholders at the General Meeting on 27th January 2012.
Based on the indicative responses received from a significant proportion of the Companys investors as at the date of authorising these accounts, the Directors have no reason to believe that the proposal will not be passed.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information about the portfolio is provided internally on that basis to the Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition, the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to acquisition which are charged to the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
Gains and losses on sales of investments, including the related foreign exchange gains and losses of a capital nature, are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end are included in the Income Statement and in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
All purchases and sales are dealt with on a trade date basis.
c Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is taken to capital.
Overseas dividends are shown gross of any withholding tax.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.
d Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the exception of expenses incidental to the purchase or sale of an investment which are charged to the capital column of the income statement.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 9 on page 40. e Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an effective interest rate basis and in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25: Financial instruments: presentation and FRS 26: Financial instruments: measurement.
Finance costs are allocated wholly to revenue.
f Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest or significant price risk exposure and are accordingly stated at cost, as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The Company has not utilised any derivative financial instruments in the current or comparative year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 g Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities and equity investments held at fair value denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.
Gains and losses on investments arising from a change in exchange rates are included in Holding gains and losses on investments.
h Taxation Current tax is provided at the amount expected to be paid or recovered.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred tax.
Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred taxation assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
i Value Added Tax VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
j Repurchase of ordinary shares for cancellation The cost of repurchasing ordinary shares including the related stamp duty and transaction costs is charged to Other reserve and dealt with in the Reconciliation of Movement in Shareholders Funds.
Share repurchase transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis.
The nominal value of ordinary share capital repurchased and cancelled is transferred out of called up share capital and into the capital redemption reserve.
Gains losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss Gains on sales of investments held at fair value through profit or loss based on historical cost 12,169 25,305 Amounts recognised as investment holding gains and losses at the previous balance sheet date in respect of investments sold during the year 9,346 8,765 Gains on sales of investments based on carrying value at the previous balance sheet date 2,823 16,540 Net movement in investment holding gains and losses 66,020 103,274 Capital charges 323 323 Total capital gains losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 63,520 119,491 JPMorgan Russian Securities plc.

Taxation a Analysis of tax charge in the year 2011 2010 000 000 UK corporation tax at 26.83% 2010: 28% 17 Double taxation relief 17 Overseas withholding tax 969 817 Current tax 969 817 b Factors affecting current tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year is higher 2010: lower than the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax for the year of 26.83% 2010: 28%.
The factors affecting the current tax charge for the year are as follows: 2011 2010 Revenue Capital Total Revenue Capital Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation 619 63,847 63,228 435 119,564 119,999 Net return loss on ordinary activities before taxation multiplied by the Companys applicable rate of corporation tax of 26.83% 2010: 28% 166 17,130 16,964 122 33,478 33,600 Effects of: Non taxable capital gains losses 17,130 17,130 33,478 33,478 Non taxable overseas dividends 305 305 75 75 Income taxed in different periods 555 555 451 451 Overseas withholding tax 969 969 817 817 Unrelieved expenses and charges 412 412 Double taxation relief 17 17 Prior years excess expenses utilised 399 399 8 8 Current tax charge for the year 969 969 817 817 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 708,000 2010: 900,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 25% 2010: 27%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 5th July 2011 and is effective from 1st April 2011.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact future reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% each year down to 23% by 1st April 2014.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The disclosures required by the amendment to FRS 29: Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments are given below.
The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 29 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio.
The Company currently holds no derivative financial instruments and its liabilities are not held at fair value.
The investments are categorised into a hierarchy consisting of the following three levels: Level 1 valued using quoted prices in active markets.
Level 2 valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1.
Quoted investments which are deemed to be less liquid due to a lower level of trading volume in the period prior to the year end, are also included in Level 2.
Level 3 valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 on page 36.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 29 hierarchy at 31st October: 2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss Equity investments 272,018 32,478 304,496 Investment in liquidity fund 7,666 7,666 Total 279,684 32,478 312,162 2010 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 Financial instruments held at fair value through profit or loss Equity investments 312,942 51,912 364,854 Investment in liquidity fund 6,395 6,395 Total 319,337 51,912 371,249 There have been no transfers into or out of level 3 during the current or comparative year.
The Companys equity investments are all traded in active markets, however, the Board has determined that stocks with a market value of 32.5 million 2010: 51.9 million are less liquid than the remainder of the portfolio, based on trading volumes in the period prior to the year end, and these have been included in Level 2.
Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page inside the front cover.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of financial risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments comprise the following: investments in Russian equity shares which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: a US$ liquidity fund: and debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market risk is given in parts i to iii of this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks, and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.
i Currency risk Certain of the Companys assets, liabilities and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates may affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowing may be used to limit the Companys exposure to anticipated changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments.
This borrowing would be limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company may use short term forward currency contracts to manage working capital requirements.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st October are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments, which are not monetary items, are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2011 Swedish US$ Rouble Krona Total 000 000 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 7,666 7,666 Net current liabilities 869 869 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 6,797 6,797 Equity investments held at fair value 294,972 9,276 304,248 Total net foreign currency exposure 301,769 9,276 311,045 2010 Swedish US$ Rouble Krona Total 000 000 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 6,395 6,395 Net current assets 4,807 158 4,965 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 11,202 158 11,360 Equity investments held at fair value 356,422 7,973 364,395 Total net foreign currency exposure 367,624 158 7,973 375,755 The above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to foreign currency risk during the year.
Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss have all been included under US$ exposure in the tables above, because they are priced in that currency.
However it should be noted that these companies are primarily exposed to the rouble.
Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys overseas income and monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and assumes a 10% 2010: 10% appreciation or depreciation in sterling against the US$, the rouble and the swedish krona.
The Companys monetary currency financial instruments are predominantly exposed to the US$ and this is deemed a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of the sterling US$ exchange rate during the year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 If sterling had weakened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2011 2010 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 755 603 Capital return 680 1,136 Total return after taxation for the year 1,435 1,739 Net assets 1,435 1,739 Conversely if sterling had strengthened by 10% this would have had the following effect: 2011 2010 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 755 603 Capital return 680 1,136 Total return after taxation for the year 1,435 1,739 Net assets 1,435 1,739 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analysis is broadly representative of the whole year.
ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable from cash deposits and the liquidity fund.
The Company has no exposure to fair value interest rate risk.
Management of interest rate risk The Company does not normally hold significant cash balances.
Short term borrowings may be used when required, however the Company currently has no loan facility in place.
Interest rate exposure The exposure of financial assets and liabilities to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is shown below.
2011 2010 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates JPM US Dollar Liquidity Fund 7,666 6,395 Cash and short term deposits 102 2,998 Total exposure 7,768 9,393 The target interest earned on the JPM US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day US Dollar London Interbank Bid Rate.
Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR.
The exposure to floating interest rates during the year fluctuated as follows: JPMorgan Russian Securities plc.

This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objective and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Other price risk exposure The Companys exposure to changes in market prices at 31st October comprises its holdings in equity investments as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Equity investments held at fair value through profit or loss 304,496 364,854 The above data is broadly representative of the exposure to other price risk during the current and comparative year.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Concentration of exposure to other price risk An analysis of the Companys investments is given on pages 13 to 15.
The equity portfolio entirely comprises Russian companies.
Accordingly there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should be noted that an investment may not be wholly exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2010: 10% in the fair value of the Companys equity investments.
This level of change does not reflect the unusual market volatility over the past three years and is presented purely as an illustration.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equity investments and adjusting for change in the management fee, but with all other variables held constant.
2011 2010 10% increase 10% decrease 10% increase 10% decrease in fair value in fair value in fair value in fair value 000 000 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 457 457 547 547 Capital return 30,450 30,450 36,485 36,485 Total return after taxation for the year and net assets 29,993 29,993 35,938 35,938 b Liquidity risk This is the risk that the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities that are settled by delivering cash or another financial asset.

Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.
