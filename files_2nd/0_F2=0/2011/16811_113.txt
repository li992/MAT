The Company has covenanted to provide security in favour of the Trustee of the Vodafone Group UK Pension Scheme whilst there is a funding deficit in the scheme.
The initial security was in the form of a Japanese law share pledge over 400,000 class 1 preferred shares of 200,000 in BB Mobile Corp. During the year, the Company and trustee agreed to replace the initial security with a charge over UK index linked gilts ILG held by the Company.
A charge in favour of the Trustee was agreed over ILG 2016 with a notional value of 100 million and ILG 2013 with a notional value of 48.9 million.
The security may be replaced either on a voluntary or mandatory basis.
As and when alternative security is provided, the Company has agreed that the security cover should include additional headroom of 33%, although if cash is used as the security asset the ratio will revert to 100% of the relevant liabilities or where the proposed replacement security asset is listed on an internationally recognised stock exchange in certain defined core jurisdictions, the trustee may decide to agree a lower ratio than 133%.
