Certain property leases contain an option for renewal.
25 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments comprise cash and short-term deposits, treasury deposits and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group also enters into forward foreign currency contracts to manage currency risks arising from the Groups operations.
It is, and has been, throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing such risks on a regular basis as summarised below: a Market risk Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holding of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters.
Interest rate risk The Group holds net funds, and hence its interest rate risk is associated with short-term cash deposits and treasury deposits.
The Groups overall objective with respect to holding these deposits is to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return.
For the presentation of market risks, IFRS 7 requires sensitivity analyses that show the effects of hypothetical changes of relevant risk variables on profit or loss and shareholders equity.
The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits.
The Group does not have any borrowings.
The impact is determined by applying sensitised interest rates to the cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposit balances.
A 1% decrease in the Sterling and US Dollar interest rate would have reduced interest income by approximately 925,000 2010 670,000 and profit after tax by 666,000 2010 480,000.
Foreign currency risk Foreign currency risk arises from the Group undertaking a significant number of foreign currency transactions in the course of operations.
These exposures arise from sales by business units in currencies other than the Groups functional currency of Sterling.
The majority of costs are denominated in the functional currency of the business unit.
The main exposures relate to the US Dollar and Euro reflecting the fact that a significant proportion of the Groups revenue and cash receipts are denominated in these currencies whilst a large proportion of its costs, such as Research and Development, are settled in Sterling and Swedish Krona.
The Group manages these exchange risks, where possible, by using currency exchange contracts for the sale of US Dollar, Euro and Yen as appropriate.
The Group enters into specific forward foreign exchange contracts for individually significant revenue contracts when the timing of forecast cash flows is reasonably certain.
In addition, the Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to sell US Dollars, Euro and Yen to match forecast cash flows arising from its recurring revenue base.
These are renewed on a revolving basis as required.
At 31 March 2011, the Group had outstanding currency exchange contracts to sell $17.75 million 2010 $24.5 million, 9.5 million 2010 12.8 million and JPY nil 2010 JPY 120 million.
The Group has not applied hedge accounting during the current year and therefore all gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts have been included in the Consolidated income statement.
The Group has investments in foreign operations whose net assets are exposed to currency translation risk.
There is currently no requirement for borrowings and therefore this risk is not managed through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income.

The impact is determined by applying the sensitised foreign exchange rate to the monetary assets and liabilities at the Balance sheet date.
Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of financial instruments being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency and being of a monetary nature: differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Groups presentation currency are not taken into consideration.
A 10% change in the US Dollar against Sterling, Euro against Sterling and Swedish Krona against Sterling would have impacted equity and profit after tax by the amounts shown below as at the reporting date shown.
In managements opinion, this is a reasonably possible change given current market conditions.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates and other foreign currencies, remain constant.
The analysis is performed on the same basis for 2009 10.

Counterparties for cash and cash equivalents and treasury deposits are governed by the treasury policy, which has been approved by the Board, and are limited to financial institutions which have a high credit rating assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit of 70 million as set out in the Groups treasury policy.
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties and provides credit to customers in the normal course of business.
The amounts presented in the Consolidated balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event, which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group has credit control functions to monitor receivable balances on an ongoing basis.
Credit checks are performed before credit is granted to new customers.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of customers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset.
The exposure to credit risk is mitigated where necessary by either letters of credit or payments in advance.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of its financial assets.
Disclosures relating to the credit associated with trade receivables are in note 20. c Liquidity risk The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash reserves and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity of financial assets and liabilities.
The Group has no significant borrowings from third parties and therefore liquidity risk is not considered a significant risk at this time.

The carrying amounts of these financial assets and liabilities in the Groups financial statements approximates their fair values.
In addition the Groups financial liabilities also include forward foreign exchange contracts.
Financial instruments which are recognised at fair value subsequent to initial recognition are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
The 3 levels are defined as follows: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
