Unavoidable lease payments represent the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let.
The provision is expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
This is expected to occur within the next 20 years.
Property provisions released during the year were as a result of the sub-letting of previously vacant properties or lease exits where dilapidations and other exit costs were less than previously provided for.
Additional provisions and amounts reversed were all in respect of exceptional items.
Redundancy In the periods presented, redundancy provisions included the total employee related costs of redundancies announced prior to the reporting date.
Amounts provided for during the year were non-exceptional in nature, relating to the cost of redundancies arising in the normal course of business.
The provision is expected to be used within one year.
Amounts reversed were previously set up as exceptional charges and were credited to exceptional items in the year.
Network and asset retirement obligations In the periods presented, provision was made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant leased network capacity.
These provisions are expected to be used over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
Provision has also been made for the best estimate of the asset retirement obligation associated with office sites, technical sites, domestic and sub-sea cabling.
This provision is expected to be used at the end of the life of the related asset on which the obligation arose.
Amounts utilised in the periods presented related predominantly to cash expenditure against unavoidable costs associated with redundant network capacity.
Additional provisions and amounts reversed in the year that impacted the income statement were all in respect of exceptional items.
Other Other provisions include the costs of integration of the THUS Group, business transformation initiatives and specific legal claims against the Group.
Additional amounts charged in the year comprised 10 million in respect of exceptional items and 3 million of ordinary operating costs.
Amounts reversed of 6 million were previously set up as non-exceptional charges.
30 Retirement benefits obligations The Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group operates pension schemes for its current and former UK and overseas employees.
These schemes include both defined benefit schemes, where retirement benefits are based on employees remuneration and length of service, and defined contribution schemes, where retirement benefits reflect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are made in accordance with recommendations from independent actuaries who value the schemes.
Demerger Prior to demerger, a number of the Groups current and former employees participated in the defined benefit portion of the Cable &Wireless Superannuation Fund CWSF, operated by the Cable & Wireless Group now Cable & Wireless Communications Group.
Amounts related to the defined benefit net expense or credit in the CWSF prior to the transfer were recharged to the Group by the Cable & Wireless Communications Group as Cable&Wireless Worldwide did not have a legal obligation to the CWSF for these amounts.
These amounts have been recorded as though they were defined contribution expenses.
As a result of the demerger see note 4, a portion of the assets and pension obligations of the CWSF were transferred to the Cable &Wireless Worldwide Retirement Plan CWWRP, a new plan operated by the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group.
The obligations transferred to the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group were determined based on members last known employer.
The plan assets transferred to the Cable&Wireless Worldwide Group were determined by reference to the obligations transferred.
Under IAS 19, this resulted in defined benefit plan assets of 1.2 billion and defined benefit pension obligations of 1.3 billion being transferred to the Group on 26 March 2010.
