162 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2011 GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 37 PAYABLES AND OTHER FINANCIAL LIABILITIES Trail commission The Group operates distribution agreements with intermediaries where further commission costs are payable in each period in which a relevant policy remains in-force.
For relevant non-participating investment contracts, a liability for the present value of this future commission cost is recognised in the balance sheet on inception of the contract.
The present value of future commission costs is deferred as an asset and amortised over the period during which the related revenue will be recognised.
At each subsequent reporting date the liability is re-measured to fair value because this financial liability is part of a portfolio of unit linked assets and liabilities whose performance is evaluated on a fair value basis.
Any increase in the liability is recognised as an additional deferred cost.
Any change in lapse assumptions or revisions to the underlying assumptions for future cash ows will be reected in the fair value movement for a period.
If the future commission liability decreases, a corresponding adjustment is made to the amortisation ofthe asset.

This liability has been determined using the net present value of the future commission which will be payable on fund values.
This valuation technique uses assumptions which are consistent with the Groups effective rate of interest, investment return assumptions and persistency assumptions used in other valuations, but it is not determined by reference to published price quotations.
The undiscounted value which is expected to be paid at maturity in respect of such commission is 259m 2010: 248m.
Payables and other financial liabilities settled after 12 months are expected to be settled within five years with the exception of derivative liabilities, as disclosed in Note 23.

Level 3 derivative liabilities of 203m 2010: nil comprise non profit non-linked interest rate contracts, which have been transferred into Level 3 during the year due to the use of measurement inputs that are not based on observable market data.
The pricing of these derivatives is dependant on interest rate assumptions.
Using reasonably alternative assumptions would result in an increase or decrease in fair value of 10m.
Following review, the prior year disclosure has been amended to more appropriately reect the measurement basis used, resulting in a reclassication of 1,662m of derivative liabilities from Level 1 to Level 2.
Trail commissions are modelled using expected cash ows, incorporating expected future persistency.
They have therefore beenclassied as level 3 liabilities.
The entire movement in the balance has been reected in the income statement during the year.
Areasonably possible alternative persistency assumption would have the effect of increasing or decreasing the liability by 5m 2010: 5m.
