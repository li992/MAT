Unit trusts Private SICAV clients Single investment platform Investment Segregated trusts mandates Benefits of a single platform Operating on a single platform gives us the flexibility to allocate business demands evolve.
It also underpins our ability to grow our resources across products and distribution channels with the business volumes across existing or new product lines with limited ability to change the relative focus in any area as market trends or cost increases.
Jupiter Fund Management plc a r e d p n o a e l g d n i n S a r s l e b n n a h e c n l o i t u g b i r t s n i d i d n a S s t c u d o r p e l p i t l u M Business review 11 Our operating model: Fund management We have a single investment platform comprising 39 fund managers, who manage a range of funds for a variety of clients.
Private client assets are managed separately by 13 dedicated private client managers.
Our investment philosophy seeks to generate 1 investment outperformance against relevant benchmarks over the medium to long term without exposing our clients to unnecessary risk.
While our fund managers work as a closely knit team, sharing stock ideas and debating market prospects, each manager has individual responsibility for their own portfolios and is held accountable for the investment performance of the funds they manage.
We also believe that fund management is an industry where experience counts and we are always looking to balance the requirement for experience with the necessary focus on the development of fresh talent.
Distribution While we operate across a number of different geographies and markets, each of which has its own characteristics, we maintain a consistent brand and distribution approach and structure our distribution efforts on a product neutral basis.
2 Our current UK distribution effort is primarily focused on the intermediary, with our advertising effort designed to build brand awareness amongst both intermediaries and end clients.
Our market share is particularly strong among IFAs and on fund platforms.
Given the predominance of bank distribution internationally, our approach outside the UK is focused on building relationships with wealth managers in our chosen territories, such as France and Germany.
Infrastructure We operate a single infrastructure platform, designed to support a growing business and its governance requirements while implementing operational efficiencies where appropriate, such as outsourcing or improved technologies.
3 This single platform ensures the fund management, distribution and marketing areas have the appropriate tools with which to do their jobs, provides executive management with the performance and risk monitoring information required to manage the business and supports the requirements of external stakeholders such as clients, shareholders and regulators.
