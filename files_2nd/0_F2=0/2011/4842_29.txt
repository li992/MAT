ii Net restructuring charges strategic reorganisation: 2010 11 2009 10 million million Asset impairments 1.6 3.3 Property charges 7.4 2.3 Other charges 8.1 17.1 5.6 Net restructuring charges relate predominantly to the renewal and transformation of the UK & Ireland business which has been focused mainly on the reformatting and re-organisation of the UK & Ireland store portfolio and the reorganisation of the service offering.
Asset impairments relate to intangible assets and items of property, plant & equipment which are to be eliminated from the business over a shorter period than their current useful expected lives and arise from restructuring initiatives which commenced in 2007 08.
Such impairments comprise incremental accelerated depreciation charges associated with the economic useful life of these assets being shortened.
Property charges comprise onerous lease costs and charges related to vacating properties.
Other charges predominantly comprise employee severance.
iii Net business impairment charges: Goodwill Other assets Property Other impairment impairment charges charges Total million milion million million million Business to be closed 15.1 31.8 6.1 17.6 70.6 PIXmania 106.3 106.3 Greek business 53.2 53.2 Associate 21.5 21.5 174.6 53.3 6.1 17.6 251.6 Dixons Retail plc 74 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements Business to be closed relates to PC City Spain following the announcement of the closure of the store operations of this business and comprises the full impairment of goodwill as well as other asset impairments which include other intangible assets, property, plant & equipment and inventory.
Other charges relate predominantly to employee severance.
PIXmania: Weakness in the Southern European economies, investment in developing new web platforms and changes in the internet retailing market have caused profit performance to be behind that envisaged at the time of the acquisition of the business and this has therefore led to an impairment to the goodwill being charged as described further in note 9.
Greek business: Following an extended period of economic difficulty and the expectation that a full recovery will be prolonged, an impairment to the goodwill has been charged as described further in note 9.
Associate: Relates to a long period of decline in the results of F-Group leading to the conclusion that the carrying value of the investment which incorporates prior year dividends received is impaired.
Further information is provided in note 12. iv The change in pension benefits in 2009 10 arose from the closure to future accrual of the defined benefit section of the UK pension scheme which occurred on 30 April 2010. v Other items comprise the following: 2010 11 2009 10 million million Impairment of other intangibles work in progress 14.9 Exceptional supplier balance write offs 12.0 Credits in respect of prior restructurings 2.0 24.9 Write off of other intangibles work in progress relates to capitalised system costs in the UK from 2008 following the decision to defer the project in order to focus on existing process improvements.
This has caused the conclusion that the as yet unamortised work in progress is impaired.
The exceptional supplier balance write offs relate to supplier receivables in PIXmania, dating back to 2008 09 and prior years.
This write off has arisen due to the culmination of a reconciliation process following the implementation of new systems highlighting the extent of the receivables outstanding and a detailed review of the Groups ability to recover these balances.
Owing to historical nature of the origin of the amounts, coupled with their only recent quantification, the write off has been treated as a non-underlying item.
Credits relate mainly to closed businesses and represent cash recoveries from third parties which due to their contingent nature had not previously been recognised.
vi Net fair value remeasurement gains and losses on revaluation of financial instruments: Items excluded from underlying finance income and expense represent the gains and losses arising from the revaluation of derivative financial instruments under methodologies stipulated by IAS 39 compared with those on an accruals basis the basis upon which all other items in the financial statements are prepared.
Such a treatment is a form of revaluation gain or loss created by an assumption that the derivatives will be settled before their maturity.
Such gains and losses are unrealised and in the directors view also conflict with both the commercial reasons for entering into such arrangements as well as Group Treasury policy whereby early settlement in the majority of cases would amount to speculative use of derivatives.
vii On 12 May 2010, the Group signed a new 360 million Revolving Credit Facility the 360 million Facility which came into effect on 9 July 2010 when the Groups pre-existing 400 million Sterling Committed Facility the 400 million Facility was cancelled.
This cancellation triggered the acceleration of the amortisation of fees from the 400 million Facility which would otherwise have been charged evenly over the period to the pre-existing facilitys maturity in October 2011. viii On 23 July 2010, the Group conditionally accepted tenders to repurchase 140 million in nominal amount of its 300 million 6.125% Guaranteed Bonds due November 2012 the 2012 Bonds, subject to the successful completion of appropriate financing to fund the repurchase.
This repurchase was financed by a new issue of 150 million 8.75% Guaranteed Notes due 3 August 2015 and for which proceeds were received on 30 July 2010.
As a result of the repurchase, charges relating to the acceleration of the amortisation of fees from the 2012 Bonds which would otherwise have been charged evenly over the period to the 2012 Bonds maturity in November 2012 has occurred together with a redemption premium.
These have been more than offset by gains arising on the notional cancellation of interest rate swaps which were in place on the portion of the 2012 Bonds which have now been redeemed.

Further details of these charges is shown in note 4 and the methodology used in their calculation is set out below.
Disposals relate to the business to be closed 2009 10 mainly related to closed businesses resulting from there being no ongoing business attaching to the goodwill.
b Impairment testing As required by IAS 36, goodwill is subject to annual impairment reviews.
These reviews are carried out using the following criteria: business acquisitions generate an attributed amount of goodwill: the manner in which these businesses are run and managed is used to determine the Cash Generating Unit CGU grouping as defined in IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: the recoverable amount of each CGU group is determined based on calculating its value in use VIU : the VIU is calculated by applying discounted cash flow modelling to managements own projections covering a five year period: cash flows beyond the five year period are extrapolated using a long term growth rate equivalent to the relevant markets Gross Domestic Product GDP : and the VIU is then compared to the carrying amount in order to determine whether impairment has occurred.
The key assumptions used in calculating value in use are: managements five year projections: the growth rate beyond five years: and the pre-tax adjusted discount rate.
Dixons Retail plc 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 9 Goodwill continued The five year projections, which have been approved by management, have been prepared using risk adjusted strategic plans which have regard to the relative performance of competitors and knowledge of the current market together with managements views on the future achievable growth in market share and impact of the committed initiatives under the Renewal and Transformation plan which includes upgrade of the store network.
The cash flows which derive from these five year projections include ongoing capital expenditure required to develop and upgrade the store network in order to maintain and operate the businesses and to compete in their markets.
In forming the five year projections, management draws on past experience as a measure to forecast future performance.
Key assumptions used in determining the five year projections comprise the growth in sales and costs over this period.
These, when combined, accordingly drive the resulting profit margins and the profit in year five of the projections which is in turn used to calculate the terminal value in the VIU calculation.
Historical amounts for both the businesses under impairment review as well as from other parts of the Group are used to generate the values attributed to these assumptions.
The growth rate beyond five years is based on the GDP for the territories in which these businesses operate.
The discount rates applied to cash flows are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital having regard to the strategic five year plans themselves already being risk adjusted to take account of specific risks in the relevant market or region.
The values attributed to these assumptions is as follows: 2011 2010 Compound Compound Growth rate Compound Compound Growth rate annual growth annual growth beyond five Pre-tax annual growth annual growth beyond five Pre-tax in sales in costs years discount rate in sales in costs years discount rate Elkjp 4.3% 4.4% 2.6% 11.7% 6.4% 6.3% 3.0% 10.9% Unieuro 11.8% 11.1% 0.9% 12.5% 9.8% 8.7% 1.0% 12.3% PIXmania 8.7% 8.3% 1.8% 12.7% 14.2% 13.5% 1.8% 13.0% Kotsovolos 1.8% 0.9% 2.0% 11.7% 1.9% 1.6% 2.1% 12.1% c Sensitivities A sensitivity analysis had been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held constant.
Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.
For 2010 11, the presentation of sensitivities to the compound annual growth rate in sales and costs represents such a change from the sensitivity to the operating profit in year five of the five year projections which was presented in 2009 10.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Elkjp there are no reasonably possible changes in any key assumption which would cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its value in use.
In the case of Unieuro, despite the continuing success of the turnaround referred to in the Performance Review section of the Directors Report, it is reasonably possible that a change in a key assumption could occur.
Similarly, in the case of PIXmania and Kotsovolos, it is also reasonably possible that a change in a key assumption could occur and because the value in use equals the respective carrying value after impairment, any adverse change in a key assumption would, in isolation, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.
The following sensitivities are therefore presented, which are calculated leaving all other variables constant: decrease in the compound annual growth rate in sales: increase in the compound annual growth rate in costs: decrease in the growth rate beyond five years: and increase in the pre-tax discount rate.
In addition to the above, a further sensitivity is presented which shows the effect of a decrease in the compound annual growth rate in sales combined with an equivalent reduction in the compound annual growth rate in costs in order to reflect how sales and costs are interconnected.

The principal scheme which operates in the UK includes a funded defined benefit section whose assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme is valued by a qualified actuary at least every three years and contributions are assessed in accordance with the actuarys advice so as to spread the pension cost over the normal expected service lives of members.
Since 1September 2002, the defined benefit section of the scheme has been closed to new entrants and on 30 April 2010 was closed to future accrual with automatic entry into the defined contribution section being offered to those active members of the defined benefit section at that time.
Membership of the defined contribution section is offered to eligible employees.
In the Nordic region, the Group operates two funded secured defined benefit pension schemes with assets held by a life insurance company as well as an unsecured pension arrangement.
In addition, contributions are made to a state pension scheme.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 0.8 million 2009 10 1.0 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period, actuarial gains losses and currency retranslation.
In other territories, the Group also provides other post-employment benefits which are largely governed by statute, in particular in Italy and Greece.
a Defined contribution pension schemes The pension charge in respect of defined contribution schemes was 12.3 million 2009 10 5.5 million.
Dixons Retail plc 89 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations continued b UK Defined benefit pension scheme actuarial valuation and assumptions A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was last carried out as at 31 March 2010 and showed a shortfall of assets compared with liabilities of 239.0 million.
This shortfall and the associated recovery plan have been agreed in principle with the trustee of the scheme with formal agreement expected shortly.
The proposed recovery plan based on this valuation commenced in 2010 11 with special contributions of 12.0 million which rise to 16.0 million in 2011 12, 20.0 million for 2012 13 and 2013 14 and rising approximately annually thereafter to 35.0 million by 2020 21.
The next triennial valuation will be as at 31 March 2013.
The Groups regular contribution rate for 2009 10 was 12.4%, which ceased on 30 April 2010 following the closure of the scheme to future accrual as described above.
The principal actuarial assumptions as at 31 March 2010 were: Rate per annum Discount rate for accrued benefits Pre retirement 6.4% Post-retirement 5.1% 5.3% Rate of increase to pensions Guaranteed Minimum Pension 0% 2.8% Pension in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pension 2.4% 4.1% Inflation 3.7% Expected return on assets 6.6% At 31 March 2010, the market value of the schemes investments was 672.0 million and, based on the above assumptions, the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 74% of the benefits accrued to members with the liabilities amounting to 911.0 million.
c UK Defined benefit pension scheme IAS 19 The following summarises the components of net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement, the funded status and amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
The methodologies set out in IAS 19 are different from those used by the scheme actuaries in determining funding arrangements.
i Principal assumptions adopted The assumptions used in calculating the expenses and obligations are set by the directors after consultation with the independent actuaries.
Rates per annum 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.4% 5.5% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries n a 3.6% Rate of increase in pensions in payment deferred pensions pre post April 2006 accrual 3.3% 2.2% 3.5% 2.3% Inflation 3.4% 3.6% The Group uses certain demographic assumptions when calculating scheme obligations which are those underlying the last formal actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2010.
In particular, post-retirement mortality has been assumed to follow the standard mortality tables S1 All Pensioners tables, based on the experience of Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS from 2000 to 2006 with medium cohort improvements up to 2009 and multipliers of 105% for males and 110% for females.
In addition, an allowance has been made for future improvements in longevity by using the new CMI 2009 Core projections with a long term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum for men and 1.0% per annum for women.
Applying such tables results in an average expected longevity of between 87.2 years and 89.5 years for men and between 88.6 years and 90.2 years for women 2010 between 87.1 years and 87.9 years for men and between 90 years and 90.7 years for women for those becoming 65 at the measurement date.
ii Amounts recognised in consolidated income statement 2010 11 2009 10 million million Current service cost charged to underlying operating profit 4.7 Non-underlying curtailment 33.4 Total operating credit 28.7 Expected return on plan assets 44.7 37.6 Interest cost on benefit obligations 50.3 45.6 Net other finance costs 5.6 8.0 Total charged credited to profit before tax 5.6 20.7 Dixons Retail plc 90 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements Other than the payments under the recovery plan, the Group does not expect to make any further contributions to its UK defined benefit pension scheme in 2011 12.
The curtailment in 2009 10 arose from the closure to future accrual of the scheme which occurred on 30 April 2010.
The effect of the closure meant that all active members of the scheme became treated as if they were deferred members.
The effect of the closure is that these members are no longer entitled to future salary increases other than in line with inflation.
This amounted to a change in benefits accruing to these members and resulted in a one off reduction in the ultimate liabilities in respect of these individuals.
iii Amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 million million million million million Present value of defined benefit obligations 949.7 929.4 693.3 740.7 726.7 Fair value of plan assets 705.7 665.9 544.5 689.7 688.3 Net obligation 244.0 263.5 148.8 51.0 38.4 Changes in the present value of the defined benefit obligation: 2011 2010 million million Opening obligation 929.4 693.3 Current service cost 4.7 Employee contributions 4.8 Interest cost 50.3 45.6 Actuarial gains losses 3.7 241.4 Benefits paid 26.3 27.0 Curtailment gain 33.4 Closing obligation 949.7 929.4 Changes in the fair value of the scheme assets: 2011 2010 million million Opening fair value 665.9 544.5 Expected return 44.7 37.6 Employer contributions regular 8.6 special 12.0 12.0 Employee contributions 4.8 Actuarial gain 9.4 85.4 Benefits paid 26.3 27.0 Closing fair value 705.7 665.9 Dixons Retail plc 91 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 21 Retirement and other post-employment benefit obligations continued Analysis of scheme assets: 2011 2010 % of fair value % of fair value Long term of total Long term of total expected rate scheme expected rate scheme of return million assets of return million assets Equities 7.3% 471.8 67% 8.1% 400.2 60% Property 5.8% 33.3 5% 6.4% 30.6 5% Bonds gilts 4.3% 185.7 26% 4.6% 222.4 33% Cash 3.4% 14.9 2% 4.0% 12.7 2% 705.7 665.9 The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined based on the market prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, applicable to the period over which the obligation is to be settled.
Actual return on the scheme assets was a gain of 54.1 million 2009 10 gain of 123.0 million.
The actual return on other post-employment benefit scheme assets was not significant.

Changes in assumptions used for determining retirement benefit costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the 2011 12 income statement and the balance sheet.
The main assumptions are the discount rate, the rate of inflation and the assumed mortality rate.
The following table provides an estimate of the potential impacts of each of these variables if applied to the current period consolidated income statement and balance sheet.
Net finance costs Net deficit 2010 11 2009 10 2011 2010 Positive negative effect: million million million million Discount rate: 0.25% increase 0.3 0.5 49.6 52.5 Inflation rate: 0.25% increase 2.4 2.5 42.9 45.3 Mortality rate: 1 year increase 1.4 1.9 25.4 33.4 The increase in scheme benefits provided to members on retirement is subject to an inflation cap.
e Other post-employment benefits IAS 19 The Group offers other post-employment benefits to employees in overseas locations.
At 30 April 2011 the net obligation in relation to these benefits was 11.6 million 2010 11.5 million.
The net movement in the obligation comprises a charge to operating profit of 4.3 million 2009 10 4.2 million with the remaining movements relating to the benefits paid in the period and currency retranslation.
Dixons Retail plc 92 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements 22 Financial instruments a Financial risk management objectives and policies Treasury operations are managed centrally within policies approved by the Board and are subject to periodic independent internal and external reviews.
Group Treasury reports regularly to the Audit Committee and the Tax & Treasury Committee.
The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed relate to market risks movements in foreign exchange and interest rates, liquidity risk and credit risk.
Areas where risks are most likely to occur are evaluated regularly.
The Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks in accordance with defined policies.
Throughout the period under review, in accordance with Group policy, no speculative use of derivatives, foreign exchange or other instruments was permitted.
The Groups accounting policies in relation to derivatives are set out in note 1.16.
Exchange rate risk The Group is exposed to exchange movements on recognised assets and liabilities, overseas earnings and translated values of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
The Groups principal translation currency exposures are the euro and Norwegian krone.
Taking into account the cost of hedging, the Groups policy is to match, in whole or in part, currency earnings with related currency costs and currency assets with currency liabilities through the use of appropriate hedging instruments.
The Group is also exposed to certain transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from purchases in currencies other than in the functional currency of the entity.
The Groups principal transactional currency exposures are the US dollar and euro.
It is Group policy to minimise the currency exposures on such purchases through the use of appropriate hedging instruments such as forward exchange contracts.
Such contracts are designed to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risks of the Group arise in respect of sterling cash, investments and euro and sterling borrowings.
Potential exposure to interest rate movements is mitigated by the Groups policy to match to the extent possible the profile of interest payments with that of its interest receipts.
Taking into account the cost of hedging, further mitigation is achieved with interest based credit commissions received and through the use of interest based hedging instruments.
Such matching is evaluated regularly to ensure that risks are minimised.
Liquidity risk It is Group policy to maintain a balance of funds, borrowings, committed bank and other facilities sufficient to meet anticipated short term and long term financial requirements.
In applying this policy the Group continuously monitors forecast and actual cash flows against the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Uncommitted facilities are used if available on advantageous terms.
It is Group treasury policy to ensure that a specific level of committed facilities is always available based on forecast working capital requirements.
Cash forecasts identifying the Groups liquidity requirements are produced and are stress tested for different scenarios including, but not limited to, reasonably possible decreases in profit margins and increases in interest rates on the Groups borrowing facilities and the weakening of sterling against other functional currencies within the Group.
Credit risk The Groups exposure to credit risk on liquid funds, investments mainly bank deposits and floating rate notes and derivative financial instruments arises from the risk of non-performance of counterparties, with a maximum exposure equal to the book value of these assets.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk through application of Group treasury policy which restricts counterparties to those with a minimum Moodys long term credit rating of A1, bank financial strength rating of C and short term credit rating of P1.
The Group also has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any single financial institution.
The Group continuously reviews the credit quality of counterparties, the limits placed on individual credit exposures and categories of investments.
The Group does not anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk given the policies in place.
The Groups receivable balances comprise a large number of individually small amounts from unrelated customers, spread across diverse industries and geographical areas.
Concentration of risk is therefore limited and maximum exposure is equal to the book value of receivables.
Sales to retail customers are made predominantly in cash or via major credit cards.
It is Group policy that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
New credit customers are assessed using an external rating report which is used to establish a credit limit.
Such limits are reviewed periodically on both a proactive and reactive basis, for example, when a customer wishes to place an order in excess of their existing credit limit.
Receivable balances are monitored regularly with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Management therefore believe that there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
Dixons Retail plc 93 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 22 Financial instruments continued Capital risk management It is the Groups policy to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain the future development of the business.
The Group is subject to certain externally imposed capital requirements in the form of banking covenants involving borrowing ratios which it met throughout the period.
The Board has delegated responsibility for routine capital expenditure to a Capital Committee, which has approval responsibility for: Group long term and budgeted capital spend, setting capital assessment criteria, new store capital approval, subsidiary company funding, business acquisitions, business disposals and contingent liabilities such as guarantees.
The Committee also approves routine statutory and internal delegated powers of authority in relation to capital expenditure.
The Group considers the manner in which funds are distributed to shareholders by assessing the performance of the business, the level of available net funds and the short to medium term strategic plans concerning future capital spend as well as the need to meet banking covenants and borrowing ratios.
Such assessment will influence the level of dividends payable as well as consideration from time to time of market purchases of the Groups own shares.
The Group monitors available net funds on a regular basis and this is affected by Free Cash Flow, one of the Groups key performance indicators as defined further in the Strategic Summary section of the Directors Report.
b Fair values of financial assets and liabilities For receivables and payables classified as financial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in notes 14 and 19, respectively.
The categories of financial assets and liabilities and their related accounting policy are set out in notes 1.11 and 1.15.
For those financial assets and liabilities which bear either a floating rate of interest or no interest, fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
These values are shown in note 22 d. The fair value of the 2012 Bonds is 154.4 million 2010 297.0 million.
The 2012 Bonds are carried at amortised cost, plus a fair value adjustment, as a result of the fair value hedge discussed below.
Excluded from the fair value is 4.5 million 2010 8.4 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
The fair value of the 2015 notes is 129.8 million.
The 2015 Notes are carried at amortised cost.
Excluded from the fair value is 3.2 million of accrued interest which is included in trade and other payables.
Fair value of derivatives is predominantly determined using observable market data such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
As such, derivatives are classified as Level 2 under the requirements of IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures.

Dixons Retail plc 94 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements c Hedging activities The Group manages exposures that arise on purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies predominantly by entering into forward foreign exchange currency contracts.
It also uses swaps and options to manage its interest rate and foreign exchange translation exposure.
At 30 April 2011 the Group had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges for the 2012 Bonds with a notional amount of 125 million 2010 250 million whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR.
At 30 April 2011 the Group also had interest rate swaps in place with a notional amount of 125 million 2010 nil whereby the Group receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR, and which act as a hedge for the 2015 Notes until August 2012.
These swaps are not designated as hedges under IAS 39.
In order to provide a hedge against certain euro denominated fixed asset investments and to finance working capital 200 million 2010 200 million has been swapped into floating rate euro borrowings bearing interest based on EURIBOR.
The Group designates financial instruments as hedges under IAS 39 as follows: Cash flow hedges At 30 April 2011 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts in place with a notional value of 415.5 million 2010 435.6 million that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges.
These contracts are expected to cover exposures ranging from one month to one year.
The fair value of these currency derivatives which have been deferred in equity amounts to a 0.9 million loss 2009 10 7.0 million loss.
In respect of contracts which matured during the period, losses of 7.4 million and losses of 6.7 million have been transferred out of equity into inventory and out of equity into operating profit, respectively 2009 10 losses of 15.1 million and gains of 3.8 million.
Hedge ineffectiveness of 0.2 million loss was recorded in the income statement 2009 10 0.9 million loss.
Fair value hedges As mentioned above the Group had interest rate swaps in place for the 2012 Bonds whereby it receives a fixed interest rate of 6.125% and pays a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR.
The interest rate swaps are used to hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of 125 million 2010 250 million of the 2012 Bonds and have the same critical terms.
The fair value of interest rate swaps entered into as fair value hedges is an asset of 9.9 million 2010 an asset of 25.0 million.
A fair value loss on the interest rate swaps of 1.3 million 2009 10 loss of 1.2 million has been recognised in the income statement and offset by an equivalent fair value gain on the 2012 Bonds.
Hedge ineffectiveness of 0.4 million loss was recorded in the income statement 2010 nil.
Hedge of net investments in foreign operations At 30 April 2011 the Group had forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency swaps in place with a notional value of 200 million 2010 200 million which have been designated as a hedge of the net investments in foreign operations.
Gains and losses on the retranslation of these derivatives are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in the foreign operations.
The fair value of currency derivatives entered into as net investment hedges is a 78.9 million loss 2009 10 74.8 million loss.
No hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in the income statement 2009 10 nil.

Cash at bank earns interest at floating rates based either on daily bank deposit rates or central bank lending rates.
Floating rate notes have an effective yield of 1.07% 2010 1.00%.
Fixed rate cash and cash equivalents, and, short term investments are predominantly money market deposits as shown in note16 and earn interest at an average effective rate of 0.64% 2010 0.54%.
Floating rate borrowings include bank overdrafts and fixed rate bonds after taking into account the effect of interest rates swaps entered into by the Group.
The weighted average effective interest rate on bank overdrafts approximates 1.5% 2010 1.5%.
The Groups interest rate swaps which relate to the 2012 Bonds and the 2015 Notes have a nominal value of 250 million 2010 250 million, receive fixed interest rates of 6.125% 2009 10 6.125% and pay floating rates of LIBOR plus margins which range from 1.59% to 2.03% 2009 10 1.59% to 3.35%.
Currency swaps with a nominal value of 200 million 2010 200 million receive LIBOR plus a margin and pay EURIBOR plus a margin.
Other swaps which matured in the prior period exchanged Norwegian krone and sterling at fixed interest rates of 5.06% and 5.67%.
The other major component of floating rate borrowings is drawings under the New Facility 2009 10 the Old Facility.
Interest on drawn amounts on the New Facility is payable at LIBOR plus a margin of 3.75%.
The commitment fee on undrawn amounts is 1.875%.
A utilisation fee of 0.25% is payable on drawings greater than 120 million but less than 240 million and a rate of 0.5% on drawings greater than 240 million.
The terms of the Old Facility were similar, but with a utilisation fee of 0.5% payable on drawings greater than 200 million but less than 300 million and 1.5% payable on drawings greater than 300 million.
Both the New Facility and the Old Facility are described further in note 17.
Dixons Retail plc 96 Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11 Financial Statements 56 -- 119 Financial Statements Sterling fixed rate borrowings relate to 50 million of the Bonds whereby the remainder have been swapped into floating rate borrowings as described in note 22 c. Amounts in respect of other currencies relate to funds held within subsidiary companies, operating in the Nordic region and Central Europe.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
e Sensitivity analysis The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, shows the sensitivity of profit before tax and total equity to changes in specified market variables on monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments as listed below.
As a consequence, the sensitivity reflects the position as at 30 April 2011 and 1 May 2010, and is not necessarily representative of actual or future outcomes.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups profit before tax due to changes in the value of monetary assets and liabilities and derivative financial instruments.
Changes in exchange rates affect the Groups total equity due to changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cashflow hedges and net investment hedges.
The table below shows the Groups sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the Groups key currencies of US dollar, euro and Norwegian krone with other variables held constant.
A 10% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.

The Groups principal floating rate interest rate exposures are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The numbers below shows the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates uniform across all currencies, with other variables held constant.
A 1% decrease would have an equal and opposite effect.
A 1% increase in interest rates would decrease profit before tax and equity by 4.1 million 2009 10 a 4.3 million decrease in profit before tax and equity.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: the balance of borrowings, investments and the derivative portfolio are all held constant for the whole year.
all net investment, fair value and cash flow hedges are assumed to be highly effective.
the effect of changes in interest rates on fixed rate bonds is calculated after taking into account the effect of interest rate swaps.
In combination these financial instruments are floating in nature.
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges arising from movements in interest rates are recorded in the income statement.
The impact of movements in exchange rates is recorded directly in equity.
changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments that are not in hedging relationships arising from movements in interest rates and exchange rates only affect the income statement to the extent that they are not offset by changes in an underlying transaction.

The Group reviews regularly its available cash resources and undrawn committed borrowing facilities required to fulfil its objectives and strategy.
Cash flow forecasts are prepared covering a five year period and these are updated annually.
Shorter term forecasts are reviewed and monitored on a regular basis in varying degrees of granularity including, in some cases, daily review.
These forecasts are used in determining both the level of borrowings required for funding purposes as well as planning for repayments of borrowings either at their maturity or sooner where practical.
An appropriate level of headroom is maintained to provide against unexpected outflows or an unforeseen downturn in trading.
Further details of committed borrowing facilities are shown in note 17.

The group reconstruction took the form of introducing a new parent company above the existing group and the merger reserve represents the difference between the capital structure of the new parent company and that of the former parent company.
The Placing and Rights Issue was effected through a structure which resulted in a merger reserve arising under section 612 of the Companies Act 2006.
Following receipt of the cash proceeds through the structure, the excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of the share capital issued was transferred from the merger reserve to retained earnings.

Share option plans Employee Share Option Scheme ESOS and Executive Share Option Plan ESOP Options are normally granted annually to executive directors and other senior executives.
In September 2008, the Group adopted a new share option plan ESOP which replaced the existing ESOS.
Options granted after this date have only been granted under the new ESOP.
The ESOS and ESOP permit making awards with a market value on the date of grant of not more than twice the recipients salary.
Options are also granted to other employees in the UK and overseas on the basis of management grade.
Vesting of options is based upon remaining in service with the Group over a three year period, unless specific circumstances apply to a participant as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Depending on grade, vesting is also dependent on the level of growth in underlying diluted earnings per share EPS over a three year period.
Options may be exercised up to seven years after the vesting date.
Save As You Earn SAYE The Group offers to all of its UK and Irish employees having completed the relevant period of service, share-based savings plans whereby amounts may be contributed up to a specified limit per plan and per employee.
Three year and five year plans have been offered annually, with exercise prices set at a 20% discount to the market share price on the date of grant.
Exercise is conditional upon employees remaining employed by the Group for the full term of the plan unless specific circumstances apply to a participant as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Employees can choose to withdraw their contributions in full from the plan at any time, together with any interest earned.
