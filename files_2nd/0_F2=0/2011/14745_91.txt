Scottish and Southern Energy 138 Annual Report 2011 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 31. financial instrumEnts anD risK continued B. risKs from usE of financial instrumEnts i credit risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations.
Credit risk arising from the Groups normal commercial operations is controlled by individual business units operating in accordance with Group policies and procedures.
Generally, for significant contracts, individual business units enter into contracts or agreements with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings only, or where suitable collateral or other security has been provided.
Counterparty credit validation is undertaken prior to contractual commitment.
Credit risk management for the Groups regulated businesses is performed in accordance with industry standards as set out by the Regulator and is controlled by the individual business units.
The Groups greatest credit risks lie with the non-regulated operations of the Generation and Supply business and the activities carried out by the Groups Treasury function, for which specific credit risk controls that match the risk profile of those activities are applied.
Exposure to credit risk in the supply of electricity and gas arises from the potential of a customer defaulting on their invoiced payables.
The financial strength and credit-worthiness of business customers is assessed prior to commencing, and for the duration of, their contract of supply.
Domestic customers credit-worthiness is reviewed from a variety of internal and external information.
Exposure to credit risk in the procurement of wholesale energy and fuel is managed by reference to agreed transaction credit limits which are determined by whether the counterparty: i holds an investment grade credit rating: or ii can be assessed as adequately credit-worthy in accordance with internal credit rules using information from other external credit agencies: or iii can provide a guarantee from an investment grade rated entity or post suitable collateral or provide other acceptable assurances in accordance with Group procedures where they have failed to meet the above conditions: or iv can be allocated a non-standard credit limit approved by the Risk and Trading Committee within its authorised limits as delegated by the Management Board.
Credit support clauses or side agreements are typically included or entered into to protect the Group against counterparty failure or nondelivery.
Within the Generation and Supply business, increasing volumes of commodity derivative products are now traded through cleared exchanges to further mitigate credit risk.
Such exchanges are subject to strict regulation by the UK Financial Services Authority FSA and participants in these exchanges are obliged to meet rigorous capital adequacy requirements.
Individual counterparty credit exposures are monitored by category of credit risk and are subject to approved limits.
At 31 March 2011, the Groups Generation and Supply business had pledged 201.1m 2010 169.9m of cash collateral and letters of credit and had received 38.7m 2010 28.6m of cash collateral and letters of credit principally to reduce exposures on credit risk.
Bank credit exposures, which are monitored and reported on daily, are calculated on a mark-to-market basis and adjusted for future volatility and probability of default.
Any issues relating to these credit exposures are presented for discussion and review by the Risk and Trading Committee.
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and deposits which are readily convertible to cash.
These are subject to insignificant risk of change in value or credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments are entered into to cover the Groups market risks commodity risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and are consequently covered elsewhere in this note.
Trade receivables represent the most significant exposure to credit risk and are stated net of collateral held and other credit enhancements.
The trade receivables total includes an allowance for impairment.
139 Overview Strategy Group performance Segmental performance Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information Concentrations of risk Trade receivables recorded by reported segment held at the 31 March were: 2011 2010 m m Power Systems Scotland 34.9 21.2 England 28.6 21.7 63.5 42.9 Generation and Supply Retail customers 563.7 596.3 Wholesale receivables 2,226.9 1,381.6 Other 366.3 355.6 Other businesses 111.3 129.8 3,331.7 2,506.2 The Generation and Supply segment accounts for 94.8% 2010 93.2% of the Groups trade receivables.
Trade receivables associated with the Groups energy related customers are recorded in this segment.
The Group also has significant receivables associated with its wholesale activities which are generally settled within 2 to 4 weeks from invoicing.
The Groups exposure to credit risk is therefore subject to diversification with no exposure to individual customers totalling 10% of trade receivables.
The biggest customer balance, due from a wholesale customer also a wholesale supplier, is less than 10% 2010 less than 9% of the total trade receivables.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: 2011 2010 m m Not past due 3,053.7 2,258.5 Past due but not individually impaired: 0 30 days 181.7 153.6 31 90 days 69.0 57.9 Over 90 days 171.5 185.1 3,475.9 2,655.1 Less: allowance for impairment 144.2 148.9 Net Trade receivables 3,331.7 2,506.2 The Group has past due debt which has not had an impairment allowance set aside to cover potential credit losses.
The Group has certain procedures to pursue customers in significant arrears and believes its impairment policy in relation to such balances is appropriate.
Those debts which are neither past due nor impaired are considered to be good and are expected to be recoverable.
The Group has other receivables which are financial assets totalling 93.4m 2010 72.1m.
The Company does not have trade receivables.
The movement in the allowance for trade receivables was: 2011 2010 m m Balance at 1 April 148.9 126.7 Increase in allowance for impairment 50.7 81.7 Impairment losses recognised 61.7 70.2 Recovery of impairment loss previously recognised 6.3 9.5 Acquired allowance 1.2 Balance at 31 March 144.2 148.9 At the end of each reporting period a review of the provision for bad and doubtful debts is performed.
It is an assessment of the potential amount of trade receivables which will not be paid by customers after the balance sheet date.
This amount is calculated by reference to the age, status and risk of each receivable.
Scottish and Southern Energy 140 Annual Report 2011 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 31. financial instrumEnts anD risK continued B. risKs from usE of financial instrumEnts continued ii liquidity risk and Going concern Liquidity risk, the risk that the Group will have insufficient funds to meet its liabilities, is managed by the Groups Treasury function.
The Group can have significant movements in its liquidity position due to movement in commodity price, working capital requirements, the seasonal nature of the business and phasing of its capital reduction programme.
Treasury is responsible for managing the banking and liquidity requirements of the Group, risk management relating to interest rate and foreign exchange exposures, and for managing the credit risk relating to the banking counterparties with which it transacts.
Short term liquidity is reviewed daily by Treasury, while the longer term liquidity position is reviewed on a regular basis by the Management Board.
The departments operations are governed by policies determined by the Management Board and any breaches of these policies are reported to the Risk and Trading Committee and the Audit Committee.
In relation to the Groups liquidity risk, the Groups policy is to ensure, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Companys reputation.
The Groups approach to managing liquidity is to seek to ensure that the Group has available committed borrowings and facilities equal to at least 105% of forecast borrowings over a rolling 12 month period.
The Group uses a cash flow forecast to monitor its ongoing borrowing requirements.
Typically, the Group will fund any short term borrowing positions by issuing commercial paper or borrowing from uncommitted bank lines and will invest in money market funds when it has a cash surplus.
In addition to the borrowing facilities listed at note 23, the Group has 70m of uncommitted bank lines and a 20m overdraft facility.
During the year, the Group has extended its existing 900m revolving credit facility and its 100m bilateral facility on reduced terms which will now mature in August 2015.
In the year, the Group borrowed 100m at a fixed price of 3.725% for a period of 10 years and 300m at a floating rate of GBP 6 month LIBOR plus 50.2 basis points also for a period of 10 years from its 400m loan facility with the European Investment Bank.
In addition to these, the Group issued Hybrid Capital of 1,161.4m in the year.
Details are included at note 28.
Under the going concern principle, the Group does not expect to issue medium to long term debt during the year ended 31 March 2012 although it may choose to do so at its discretion.
Taking this and the current liquidity in the commercial paper market and the availability of undrawn committed bank facilities into account, the Directors have concluded that the Group has sufficient headroom to continue as a going concern.
In coming to this conclusion the Directors have taken into account the successful issuance of 4.1bn of medium to long term debt including Hybrid Capital since July 2008, the Groups credit rating, the successful renewal and increase of committed bank facilities and current market conditions.
The statement of going concern is included in the Corporate Governance report on page 75.
Treasury also manage the Groups interaction with its relationship banks defined as those banks that support the Companys financing activities through their ongoing participation in the committed lending facilities that are maintained by the Group.
These are each allocated financial limits, subject to the maintenance of a minimum credit rating of A or equivalent allocated by a recognised major ratings group.
In respect of short-term cash management, counterparties are subject to review and approval according to defined criteria.
As at 31 March 2011, the value of outstanding cash collateral in respect of mark-to-market related margin calls on exchange traded positions was nil 2010 71.2m.
The contractual cash flows shown in the following tables are the contractual undiscounted cash flows under the relevant financial instruments.
Where the contractual cash flows are variable based on a price, foreign exchange rate or index in the future, the contractual cash flows in the following tables have been determined with reference to the relevant price, foreign exchange rate, interest rate or index as at the balance sheet date.
In determining the interest element of contractual cash flows in cases where the Group has a choice as to the length of interest calculation periods and the interest rate that applies varies with the period selected, the contractual cash flows have been calculated assuming the Group selects the shortest available interest calculation periods.
Where the holder of an instrument has a choice of when to redeem, the amounts in the following tables are on the assumption the holder redeems at the earliest opportunity.
The numbers in the following tables have been included in the Groups cash flow forecasts for the purposes of considering liquidity risk as noted above.
It should be noted that cash flows associated with future energy sales and commodity contracts which are not IAS 39 financial instruments are not included in this analysis, which is prepared in accordance with IFRS 7.
This arises from the Groups requirement to source gas or electricity to supply customers, or to procure fuel to produce electricity from its generation assets.
The Groups strategy is to manage all exposures to commodity risk through volumetric limits and to measure the exposure by use of a Value at Risk VaR model.
The exposure is subject to financial limits established by the Management Board and managed by the Risk and Trading Committee.
The exposure is reported to the Committee on a monthly basis and to the Board when certain trigger levels are exceeded.
Within this approach, only certain of the Groups energy commodity contracts are deemed to constitute financial instruments under IAS 39.
As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial commodity contracts, it is only the fair value of IAS 39 financial instruments which represents the exposure of the Groups commodity price risk under IFRS 7.
This is a consequence of the accounting policy which requires that commodity contracts which are designated as financial instruments under IAS 39 should be accounted for on a fair value basis with changes in fair value reflected in profit or equity.
Conversely, commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as own use contracts.
As fair value changes in own use contracts are not reflected through profit or equity, these do not represent the IFRS 7 commodity price risk.
Therefore, as the overall Group VaR associated 143 Overview Strategy Group performance Segmental performance Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information with the Generation and Supply business is monitored for internal risk management purposes and is outside the scope of IAS 39, these measures are not required to comply with IFRS 7.
Operationally, the economic risks associated with this exposure are managed through a selection of longer and shorter term contracts for commodities such as gas, electricity, coal and oil, the acquired exploration and production business and also the flexibility of the Groups fleet of generation assets.
Short-term exposures arise from the requirement to match volumes of procured gas, electricity and power station fuel with demand for gas and electricity by its customers, which can vary from expectations and result in a requirement to close the resulting positions at unfavourable prices.
This aspect of commodity risk is managed through the ability to increase or decrease energy production either in the form of flexible purchase contracts or assets such as pumped storage generating plant, flexible hydro generating plant, standby oil plant and gas storage.
Longer-term exposures are managed through the Groups generation plant and longer term contracts including forwards, futures contracts and other financial instruments.
These, in turn, are used to reduce short-term market exposures.
Certain commodity contracts are entered into primarily for own use purposes to supply to existing customers or to fuel existing power stations.
However, as noted, a number of these contracts do not qualify for own use treatment under IAS 39 and are subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
In addition to this, the Group enters into certain contracts to manage commodity price and volume risk.
These are also subject to fair value measurement through the income statement.
Finally, certain other physical contracts are treated as the hedging instrument in documented cash flow hedging relationships where the hedged item is the forecast future purchase requirement to meet production or customer demand.
The accounting policies associated with such items are explained in note 1.
The consequential commodity risk which derives from these activities is quantified by the use of a Value at Risk VaR model which considers exposures in all commodities and provides an estimate of the potential change to the Groups forecast profits over a given period and to a given confidence level.
The calculated financial risk is controlled through the imposition of a number of risk limits approved by the Board and monitored and managed by the Risk and Trading Committee.
The Groups exposure to commodity risk is reported to and monitored by the Risk and Trading Committee and to the Board by exception.
The Groups exposure to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7 is measured by reference to the Groups IAS 39 commodity contracts.
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of sensitivity analysis for market risks that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Groups financial position and performance to changes in market variables impacting upon the fair value or cash flows associated with the Groups financial instruments.
Therefore, the sensitivity analysis provided discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at the balance sheet date assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant commodity price had occurred, and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date.
The reasonably possible changes in commodity prices used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on calculated or implied volatilities where available, or historical data.
The sensitivity analysis has been calculated on the basis that the proportion of commodity contracts that are IAS 39 financial instruments remains consistent with those at that point.
Excluded from this analysis are all commodity contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39.

This analysis should be used with caution as the impacts disclosed are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced.
It should also be noted that these sensitivities are based on calculations which do not consider all interrelationships, consequences and effects of such a change in those prices.
iv currency risk The Group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling but also conducts business in foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk arising from exchange rate movements which will be reflected in the Groups transaction costs or in the underlying foreign currency assets of its foreign operations.
The Groups policy is to use forward contracts, swaps and options to manage its exposures to foreign exchange risk.
All such exposures are transactional in nature, and relate primarily to procurement contracts, commodity purchasing and related freight requirements, commodity hedging, long term plant servicing and maintenance agreements, and the purchase and sale of carbon emission certificates.
The Groups policy is to seek to hedge 100% of its currency requirements arising under all committed contracts excepting commodity hedge transactions, the requirements for which are significantly less predictable.
The policy for these latter transactions is to assess the Groups requirements on a rolling basis and to enter into cover contracts as appropriate.
The Group has foreign subsidiary operations with significant euro-denominated net assets.
The Groups policy is to hedge its net investment in its foreign operations by ensuring the net assets whose functional currency cash flows are denominated in euros are matched by borrowings in euros.
For the acquired net assets whose functional cash flows are in sterling, the Group will ensure sterling denominated borrowings are in place to minimise currency risk.
Significant exposures are reported to, and discussed by, the Risk and Trading Committee on an ongoing basis and additionally form part of the bi-annual Treasury report to the Audit Committee.
At the balance sheet date, the total nominal value of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts that the Group has committed to is: 2011 2010 m m Forward foreign exchange contracts 2,074.4 1,864.8 The Groups exposure to foreign currency risk was as follows: 2011 2010 DKK cHf DKK CHF m million m $m million m million m $m million Loans and borrowings 28,000.0 664.8 150.0 20.0 28,000.0 1,370.0 210.0 Purchase and commodity contract commitments 1,036.8 415.0 1,859.7 253.4 843.1 627.5 2,818.4 Gross exposure 28,000.0 1,036.8 1,079.8 2,009.7 20.0 28,253.4 843.1 1,997.5 3,028.4 Forward exchange swap contracts 28,000.0 1,036.8 770.0 1,682.3 20.0 28,253.4 843.1 843.2 1,538.9 Net exposure in currency 309.8 327.4 1,154.3 1,489.5 Net exposure in m 273.7 203.8 1,028.1 980.5 145 Overview Strategy Group performance Segmental performance Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information This represents the net exposure to foreign currencies, reported in pounds sterling, and arising from all Group activities.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the relative proportions of instruments in foreign currencies being consistent as at the balance sheet date.
This includes only monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than sterling and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations but not the corresponding impact of the net investment hedge.
The sensitivity analysis is indicative only and it should be noted that the Groups exposure to such market rate changes is continually changing.
The calculations are based on linear extrapolations of rate changes which may not reflect the actual result which would impact upon the Group.
A 10% increase in foreign currency exchange rates would have had the following impact on profit after taxation, based on the assumptions presented above: Equity Income Statement at 31 march At 31 March at 31 march At 31 March 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m US Dollars 16.5 78.4 Euro 68.8 58.4 46.6 23.9 DKK CHF 68.8 58.4 30.1 102.3 The impact of a 10% decrease in rates would be an equal and opposite change in the annual charge.
v interest rate risk Interest rate risk derives from the Groups exposure to changes in the value of an asset or liability or future cash flows through changes in interest rates.
The Groups policy is to manage this risk by stipulating that a minimum of 50% of Group borrowings be subject to fixed rates of interest, either directly through the debt instruments themselves or through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Such instruments include interest rate swaps and options, forward rate agreements and, in the case of debt raised in currencies other than sterling, cross currency swaps.
These practices serve to reduce the volatility of the Groups financial performance.
Although interest rate derivatives are primarily used to hedge risk relating to current borrowings, under certain circumstances they may also be used to hedge future borrowings.
Any such pre-hedging is unwound at the time of pricing the underlying debt, either through cash settlement on a net present value basis or by transacting offsetting trades.
The floating rate borrowings mainly comprise commercial paper issued at interest rates of LIBOR plus a variable margin and cash advances from the European Investment Bank EIB.
The impact of a change in interest rates is dependent on the specific details of the financial asset or liability in question.
Changes in fixed rate financial assets and liabilities, which account for the majority of cash, loans and borrowings, are not measured at fair value through the income statement.
In addition to this, changes to fixed-to-floating hedging instruments which are recorded under cash flow hedge accounting also do not impact the income statement.
Changes in variable rate instruments and hedging instruments and hedged items recorded under fair value hedge accounting are recorded through the income statement.
The exposure measured is therefore based on variable rate debt and instruments.
The net exposure to interest rates at the balance sheet date can be summarised thus: 2011 2010 carrying Carrying amount amount m m Interest bearing earning assets and liabilities: Fixed 4,258.4 4,833.6 Floating 1,016.2 1,090.7 5,274.6 5,924.3 Represented by: Cash and cash equivalents 476.9 261.7 Derivative financial liabilities 116.5 110.5 Loans and borrowings 5,262.8 5,691.1 Finance lease obligations 372.2 384.4 5,274.6 5,924.3 Scottish and Southern Energy 146 Annual Report 2011 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 31. financial instrumEnts anD risK continued B. risKs from usE of financial instrumEnts continued Following from this, the table below represents the expected impact of a change in 100 basis points in short term interest rates at the reporting date in relation to equity and income statement.
The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant.
An increase in exchange rates would be a change to either the income statement or equity.
The assessment is based on a revision of the fair value assumptions included in the calculated exposures in the previous table.
All sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis of the proportion of fixed to floating instruments being consistent as at the balance sheet date and is stated after the effect of taxation.
2011 2010 m m Income statement 10.4 9.9 10.4 9.9 The impact of a decrease in rates would be an identical reduction in the annual charge.
There is no impact on equity as the analysis relates to the Groups net exposure at the balance sheet date.
Contracts qualifying for hedge accounting are, by definition, part of the Groups covered position.
vi primary statement disclosures For financial reporting purposes, the Group has classified derivative financial instruments into two categories, operating derivatives and financing derivatives.
Operating derivatives include all qualifying commodity contracts including those for electricity, gas, oil, coal and carbon.
Financing derivatives include all fair value and cash flow interest rate hedges, non-hedge accounted mark-to-market interest rate derivatives, cash flow foreign exchange hedges and non-hedge accounted foreign exchange contracts.
Non-hedge accounted contracts are treated as held for trading.
The net movement reflected in the Income Statement can be summarised thus: 2011 2010 m m operating derivatives Total result on operating derivatives i 887.9 3,449.6 Less: Amounts settled ii 573.9 3,881.8 Movement in unrealised derivatives 1,461.8 432.2 financing derivatives and hedged items Total result on financing derivatives i 935.9 640.6 Less: Amounts settled ii 891.5 604.1 Movement in unrealised derivatives 44.4 36.5 net income statement impact 1,417.4 395.7 i T otal result on derivatives in the income statement represents the total amounts charged or credited to the income statement in respect of operating and financial derivatives.
ii Amounts settl ed in the year represent the result on derivatives transacted which have matured or been delivered and have been included within the total result on derivatives.
147 Overview Strategy Group performance Segmental performance Corporate governance Financial statements Shareholder information The net derivative financial assets and liabilities are represented as follows: 2011 2010 m m Derivative financial assets Non-current 990.1 466.3 Current 2,525.5 1,468.3 3,515.6 1,934.6 Derivative liabilities Non-current 769.3 899.0 Current 2,307.5 2,020.7 Total derivative liabilities 3,076.8 2,919.7 net asset liability 438.8 985.1 fair Value Hierarchy The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable.
kk Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities.
kk Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly ie as prices or indirectly ie derived from prices.
kk Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.

Cash flow hedges are contracts entered into to hedge a forecast transaction or cash flow risk generally arising from a change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates and which meet the effectiveness criteria prescribed by IAS 39.
The Groups accounting policy on cash flow hedges is explained in note 1.
The following table indicates the contractual maturities of the expected transactions and the qualifying cash flow hedges associated: cash flow hedges 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2011 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 2010 carrying Expected 0-12 1-2 2-5 5 Carrying Expected 0-12 1-2 2-5 5 amount cash flows months years years years amount cash flows months years years years m m m m m m m m m m m m interest rate swaps: Liabilities 4.0 4.0 2.2 1.3 0.5 7.1 7.1 3.2 2.1 1.8 forward exchange contracts: Assets 18.5 237.8 186.2 11.8 19.5 20.3 22.0 543.5 485.5 11.8 19.4 26.8 Liabilities 0.6 10.2 5.5 4.7 1.1 3.3 2.0 1.2 0.1 17.9 248.0 191.7 16.5 19.5 20.3 20.9 546.8 487.5 13.0 19.5 26.8 Scottish and Southern Energy 148 Annual Report 2011 Notes on the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 March 31. financial instrumEnts anD risK continued B. risKs from usE of financial instrumEnts continued net investment hedge The Groups net investment hedge consists of debt issued in the same currency as the net investment in foreign subsidiaries with denominated functional currencies being the Airtricity Supply business and the Ireland and European wind farm portfolios.
The hedge compares the element of these net assets whose functional cash flows are denominated in to the matching portion of the borrowings held by the Group.
This therefore provides protection against movements in foreign exchange rates.
Gains and losses in the hedge are recognised in equity and will be transferred to the income statement on disposal of the foreign operation 2011 4.3m gain, 2010 47.2m loss.
Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the income statement 2011 nil, 2010 nil.
viii capital management The Boards policy is to maintain a strong balance sheet and credit rating so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the business.
The Groups credit ratings are also important in maintaining an efficient cost of capital and in limiting collateral requirements throughout the Group.
As at 31 March 2011, the Groups long term credit rating was A3 stable outlook for Moodys and Astable outlook for Standard & Poors.
These remained unchanged in the year to 31 March 2011.
Further detail of the capital management objectives, policies and procedures are included in the Financial management and balance sheet section of the Financial Overview at pages 20 to 22 of this report.
The maintenance of a medium-term corporate model is a key control in monitoring the development of the Groups capital structure, and allows for detailed scenarios and sensitivity testing.
Key ratios drawn from this analysis underpin regular updates to the Board and include the ratios used by the rating agencies in assessing the Groups credit ratings.
From time-to-time the Group purchases its own shares on the market: the timing of these purchases depends on market prices and economic conditions.
The use of share buy-backs is the Groups benchmark for investment decisions and can be utilised at times when management believe the Groups shares are undervalued.
No share buy-back was made during the year.
The Groups debt requirements are principally met through issuing bonds denominated in sterling and euros as well as medium term bank loans predominately with the European Investment Bank.
The Group also maintains 1bn of committed bank facilities that act as a backstop to the Groups commercial paper programme and these remain undrawn for the majority of the time.
In October 2010 the Group issued its debut Hybrid bond, a financial instrument which brings together features of both debt and equity and is perpetual and subordinate to all senior creditors.
The dual tranche issue comprised 750m and 500m 461m and has an all-in funding cost of around 5.6% per annum.
There is no fixed redemption date but SSE may, at its sole discretion, redeem all, but not part of, these bonds at their principal amount on 1 October 2015 or 1 October 2020 or any subsequent annual coupon payment date.
The issue of the Hybrid bond and the equity placing back in January 2009 reflects the Groups prudent approach to financing investment and has also enhanced the Groups future options by providing additional sources of funding.
In summary, the Groups intent is to balance returns to shareholders between current returns through dividends and long-term capital investment for growth.
In doing so, the Group will maintain its capital discipline and will continue to operate within the correct economic environment prudently.
There were no changes to the Groups capital management approach during the year.
