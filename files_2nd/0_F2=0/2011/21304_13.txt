com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 1 significant accounting policies This section describes Barclays significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates that relate to the financial statements and notes as a whole.
If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a specic note, the applicable accounting policy and or critical accounting estimate is contained within the relevant note.
Reporting entity These financial statements are prepared for Barclays PLC and its subsidiaries the Barclays PLC Group or the Group under Section 399 of the Companies Act 2006.
The Group is a major global financial services provider engaged in retail banking, credit cards, wholesale banking, investment banking, wealth management and investment management services.
In addition, individual financial statements have been presented for the holding company, Barclays PLC the Company.
Barclays PLC is a public limited company, incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales having a registered ofce in England and is the holding company of the Group.
Compliance with International Financial Reporting Standards The consolidated financial statements of the Group, and the individual financial statements of Barclays PLC, have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and interpretations IFRICs issued by the Interpretations Committee, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
They are also in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the European Union.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the consolidated and individual financial statements are set out below, and in the relevant notes to the financial statements.
These policies have been consistently applied.
There were no changes in accounting policy in the year.
Basis of preparation The consolidated and individual financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modied to include the fair valuation of investment property and particular financial instruments to the extent required or permitted under IFRS as set out in the relevant accounting policies.
They are stated in millions of pounds Sterling m, the functional currency of Barclays PLC.
Accounting policies Barclays prepares financial statements in accordance with IFRS.
The Groups significant accounting policies relating to specic financial statement items, together with a description of the accounting estimates and judgements that were critical to preparing them, are set out under the relevant notes.
Accounting policies that affect the financial statements as a whole are set out below.
i Consolidation Barclays applies IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities SPEs.
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Barclays PLC and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities over which it has control of the financial and operating policies through its holdings of voting shares and SPEs, which are consolidated when the substance of the relationship between the Group and the entity indicates control.
The control assessment for special purpose entities includes an assessment of the Groups exposure to the risks and benets of the entity.
The consolidation of SPEs is considered at inception, based on the arrangements in place and the assessed risk exposures at that time.
The initial consolidation analysis is revisited at a later date if: the Group acquires additional interests in the entity: the contractual arrangements of the entity are amended such that the relative exposures to risks and rewards change: and the Group acquires control over the main operating and financial decisions of the entity.
Intra-group transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation and consistent accounting policies are used throughout the Group for the purposes of the consolidation.
Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occur after control has already been obtained and they do not result in loss of control.
Details of the principal subsidiaries are given in Note 40.

com annualreport 205 1 significant accounting policies continued ii Foreign currency translation The Group applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling or the relevant functional currency of foreign operations at the rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances are translated at the period end exchange rates.
Exchange gains and losses on such balances are taken to the income statement.
The Groups foreign operations including subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and branches based mainly outside the UK may have other functional currencies than Sterling.
The functional currency of an operation is the currency of the main economy to which it is exposed.
Prior to consolidation or equity accounting the assets and liabilities of non-Sterling operations are translated at the closing rate and items of income, expense and other comprehensive income are translated into Sterling at the rate on the date of the transactions.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in currency translation reserves within equity.
These are transferred to the income statement when the Group loses control, joint control or significant inuence over the foreign operation or on partial disposal of the operation.
iii Financial assets and liabilities The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39 for the recognition, classication and measurement and derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities, for the impairment of financial assets, and for hedge accounting.
Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities when it becomes a party to the terms of the contract, which is the trade date or the settlement date.
Classication and measurement Financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised at fair value and may be held at fair value or amortised cost depending on the Groups intention toward the assets and the nature of the assets and liabilities, mainly determined by their contractual terms.
The accounting policy for each type of financial asset or liability is included within the relevant note for the item.
The Groups policies for determining the fair values of the assets and liabilities are set out in Note 20.
Derecognition The Group derecognises a financial asset, or a portion of a financial asset, from its balance sheet where the contractual rights to cash ows from the asset have expired, or have been transferred, usually by sale, and with them either substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset or significant risks and rewards, along with the unconditional ability to sell or pledge the asset.
Financial liabilities are fide-recognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms generally a difference of 10% in the present value of the cash ows is accounted for as an extinguishment of the original financial liability and the recognition of a new financial liability.
Transactions in which the Group transfers assets and liabilities, portions of them, or financial risks associated with them can be complex and it may not be obvious whether substantially all of the risks and rewards have been transferred.
It is often necessary to perform a quantitative analysis.
Such an analysis compares the Groups exposure to variability in asset cash ows before the transfer with its retained exposure after the transfer.
A cash ow analysis of this nature may require judgement.
In particular, it is necessary to estimate the assets expected future cash ows as well as potential variability around this expectation.
The method of estimating expected future cash ows depends on the nature of the asset, with market and market-implied data used to the greatest extent possible.
The potential variability around this expectation is typically determined by stressing underlying parameters to create reasonable alternative upside and downside scenarios.
Probabilities are then assigned to each scenario.
Stressed parameters may include default rates, loss severity or prepayment rates.
iv Issued debt and equity instruments The Group applies IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation, to determine whether funding is either a financial liability debt or equity.
Issued financial instruments or their components are classied as liabilities if the contractual arrangement results in the Group having a present obligation to either deliver cash or another financial asset, or a variable number of equity shares, to the holder of the instrument, if this is not the case, the instrument is generally an equity instrument and the proceeds included in equity, net of transaction costs.
Dividends and other returns to equity holders are recognised when paid or declared by the members at the annual general meeting and treated as a deduction from equity.
Where issued financial instruments contain both liability and equity components, these are accounted for separately.
The fair value of the debt is estimated first and the balance of the proceeds is included within equity.

com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 1 significant accounting policies continued 5.
Future accounting developments As at 31 December 2011 the IASB had issued the following accounting standards.
These are effective on 1 January 2013, subject to EU endorsement, unless otherwise indicated: IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements which replaces requirements in IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements and SIC 12 Consolidation Special Purpose Entities.
This introduces new criteria to determine whether entities in which the Group has interests should be consolidated.
The Group is considering the impact of the new standard and is currently unable to provide an estimate of the financial effects of its adoption: IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, which replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
This species the accounting for joint arrangements whether these are joint operations or joint ventures.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group: IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities This species the required disclosures in respect of interests in, and risks arising, from subsidiaries, joint ventures, associates and structured entities whether consolidated or not.
As a disclosure only standard it will have no financial impact: IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement.
This provides comprehensive guidance on how to calculate the fair value of financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.
It is not expected to have a material impact on the Group financial statements: IAS 19 Employee Benets Revised 2011.
This requires that actuarial gains and losses arising from dened benefit pension schemes are recognised in full.
Previously the Group deferred these over the remaining average service lives of the employees the corridor approach.
See Note 39 for more information and an estimate of the financial effects of adoption: and IAS 32 and IFRS 7 Amendments Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities.
The circumstances in which netting is permitted have been claried and disclosures on offsetting have been considerably expanded.
The amendments on offsetting are effective from 1 January 2014 and those on disclosures from 1 January 2013.
In 2009 and 2010, the IASB issued IFRS 9 Financial Instruments which contains new requirements for accounting for financial assets and liabilities, and will contain new requirements for impairment and hedge accounting, replacing the corresponding requirements in IAS 39.
It will lead to significant changes in the way that the Group accounts for financial instruments.
The key changes issued and proposed relate to: Financial assets.
Financial assets will bet held at either fair value or amortised cost, except for equity investments not held for trading, which may be held at fair value through other comprehensive income: Financial liabilities.
Gains and losses on fair value changes in own credit arising on non-derivative financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss will be excluded from the Income Statement and instead taken to other comprehensive income: Impairment.
Expected losses rather than only incurred losses will be reected in impairment allowances for financial assets that are not classied as fair value through profit or loss: and Hedge accounting.
Hedge accounting will be more closely aligned with financial risk management.
Adoption is not mandatory until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2015, subject to EU endorsement.
Earlier adoption is possible, subject to endorsement and nalisation of the standard.
At this stage, it is not possible to fully determine the potential financial impacts of adoption of IFRS 9 on the Group.
In addition, the IASB has indicated that it will issue a new standard on accounting for leases.
Under the proposals, lessees would be required to recognise assets and liabilities arising from both operating and finance leases on the balance sheet.
The IASB also plans to issue new standards on insurance contracts and revenue recognition.
The Group will consider the financial impacts of these new standards as they are nalised.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires the use of estimates.
It also requires management to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
The key areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions are significant to the consolidated and individual financial statements are highlighted under the relevant note.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements are disclosed in: Page Page Credit in charges and impairment on available for sale assets 210 Goodwill and intangible assets 242 Tax 213 Provisions 246 Available for sale assets 224 Retirement benefit obligations 263 Fair value of financial instruments 225 The strategic report Governance Risk management Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.

Other disclosures To improve transparency and ease of reference, by concentrating related information in one place, and to reduce duplication, certain disclosures required under IFRS have been included within the Risk management and Financial review sections as follows: segmental reporting on pages 173 to 174 and 208: credit risk management on pages 79 to 120 including exposures to selected countries: market risk on pages 121 to 129: funding risk capital on pages 130 to 138: and funding risk liquidity on pages 139 to 150.
These are covered by the Audit opinion included on page 195.
208 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued Performance The notes included in this section focus on the results and performance of Barclays.
Information on the income generated, expenditure incurred, segmental performance, tax, earnings per share and dividends are included here.
2 Segmental reporting Presentation of segmental reporting The Groups segmental reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Executive Committee, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments and has been identied as the chief operating decision maker.
All transactions between business segments are conducted on an arms length basis, with intra-segment revenue and costs being eliminated in Head Ofce.
Income and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining business segment performance.
An analysis of the Groups performance by business segment and income by geographic segment is included on pages 173 and 174.
3 Net interest income Accounting for interest income and expense The Group applies IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Interest income on loans and advances at amortised cost, available for sale debt investments, and interest expense on financial liabilities held at amortised cost, are calculated using the effective interest method which allocates interest, and direct and incremental fees and costs, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest method requires the Group to estimate future cash ows, in some cases based on its experience of customers behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
Due to the large number of products and types both assets and liabilities, there are no individual estimates that are material to the results or financial position.
Other interest income principally includes interest income relating to reverse repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Similarly, other interest expense principally includes interest expense relating to repurchase agreements and hedging activity.
Included in net interest income is hedge ineffectiveness as detailed on page 223.
com annualreport 209 4 Net fee and commission income Accounting for net fee and commission income The Group applies IAS 18 Revenue.
Fees and commissions charged for services provided or received by the Group are recognised as the services are provided, for example on completion of the underlying transaction.
2011 2010 2009 m m m Banking, investment management and credit related fees and commissions 9,958 10,142 9,711 Brokerage fees 87 77 88 Foreign exchange commission 163 149 147 Fee and commission income 10,208 10,368 9,946 Fee and commission expense 1,586 1,497 1,528 Net fee and commission income 8,622 8,871 8,418 5 Net trading income Accounting for net trading income In accordance with IAS 39, trading positions are held at fair value and the resulting gains and losses are included in the income statement, together with interest and dividends arising from long and short positions and funding costs relating to trading activities.
Income arises from the sale and purchase of trading positions, margins which are achieved through market-making and customer business, and from changes in fair value caused by movements in interest and exchange rates, equity prices and other market variables.
Own credit gains losses arise from the fair valuation of financial liabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss.
See Note 19 Financial liabilities designated at fair value.
2011 2010 2009 m m m Trading income 4,952 7,687 8,821 Own credit gains losses 2,708 391 1,820 Net trading income 7,660 8,078 7,001 Included within net trading income were losses of 16m 2010: 32m gain, 2009: 2,349m loss on financial assets designated at fair value and gains of 3,850m 2010: 903m loss, 2009: 3,158m loss on financial liabilities designated at fair value.
6 Net investment income Accounting for net investment income Dividends are recognised when the right to receive the dividend has been established.
Other accounting policies relating to net investment income are set out in Note 18, Available for sale financial assets, and Note 16, Financial assets designated at fair value.
2011 2010 2009 m m m Net gain from disposal of available for sale assets 1,645 1,027 349 Dividend income 129 116 6 Net gain loss from financial instruments designated at fair value 287 274 208 Other investment income losses 244 60 91 Net investment income 2,305 1,477 56 210 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 7 Credit impairment charges and impairment on available for sale assets Accounting for the impairment of financial assets Loans and other assets held at amortised cost In accordance with IAS 39, the Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that loan assets or available for sale financial investments debt or equity will not be recovered in full and, wherever necessary, recognises an impairment loss in the income statement.
An impairment loss is recognised if there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of events that have occurred and these have adversely impacted the estimated future cash ows from the assets.
These events include: becoming aware of significant financial difficulty of the issuer or obligor: a breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments: the Group, for economic or legal reasons relating to the borrowers financial difficulty, grants a concession that it would not otherwise consider: it becomes probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation: the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties: and observable data at a portfolio level indicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash ows, although the decrease cannot yet be ascribed to individual financial assets in the portfolio such as adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers in the portfolio or national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaults on the assets in the portfolio.
Impairment assessments are conducted individually for significant assets, which comprise all wholesale customer loans and larger retail business loans and collectively for smaller loans and for portfolio level risks, such as country or sectoral risks.
For the purposes of the assessment, loans with similar credit risk characteristics are grouped together generally on the basis of their product type, industry, geographical location, collateral type, past due status and other factors relevant to the evaluation of expected future cash ows.
The impairment assessment includes estimating the expected future cash ows from the asset or the group of assets, which are then discounted using the original effective interest rate calculated for the asset.
If this is lower than the carrying value of the asset or the portfolio, an impairment allowance is raised.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed by adjusting the allowance account.
The amount of the reversal is recognised in the income statement.
Following impairment, interest income continues to be recognised at the original effective interest rate on the restated carrying amount.
Uncollectable loans are written off against the related allowance for loan impairment on completion of the Groups internal processes and all recoverable amounts have been collected.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited to the income statement.
Available for sale financial assets Impairment of available for sale debt instruments Debt instruments are assessed for impairment in the same way as loans.
If impairment is deemed to have accrued, the cumulative decline in the fair value of the instrument that has previously been recognised in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
This may be reversed if there is evidence that the circumstances of the issuer have improved.
Impairment of available for sale equity instruments Where there has been a prolonged or significant decline in the fair value of an equity instrument below its acquisition cost, it is deemed to be impaired.
The cumulative net loss that has been previously recognised directly in equity is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
Increases in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
Further declines in the fair value of equity instruments after impairment are recognised in the income statement.
2011 2010 2009 m m m Loan impairment 3,790 5,625 7,358 Available for sale assets excluding BlackRock, Inc. 60 51 670 Reverse repurchase agreements 48 4 43 Credit impairment charges and other provisions 3,802 5,672 8,071 Impairment of investment in BlackRock, Inc. 1,800 More information on the impairment assessment and the measurement of credit losses is included on page 89-91.
The movements on the impairment allowance and the charge for the year is shown on page 94.
com annualreport 211 7 Credit impairment charges and impairment on available for sale assets continued As at 30 September 2011, an impairment charge of 1,800m was recognised resulting from an assessment that there was objective evidence that the Groups available for sale equity investment in BlackRock, Inc. was impaired.
The impairment reects the recycling through the income statement of the cumulative reduction in market value previously recognised in the available for sale reserve, since the Groups acquisition of its holding in BlackRock, Inc. as part of the sale of Barclays Global Investors on 1 December 2009.
The fair value of the holding at 31 December 2011 was 4.1bn and the 0.7bn increase in the value of the investment since 30 September 2011 has been recognised in the available for sale reserve.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The calculation of the impairment allowance involves the use of judgement, based on the Groups experience of managing credit risk.
Within the retail and small businesses portfolios, which comprise large numbers of small homogeneous assets with similar risk characteristics where credit scoring techniques are generally used, statistical techniques are used to calculate impairment allowances on a portfolio basis, based on historical recovery rates and assumed emergence periods.
These statistical analyses use as primary inputs the extent to which accounts in the portfolio are in arrears and historical information on the eventual losses encountered from such delinquent portfolios.
There are many such models in use, each tailored to a product, line of business or customer category.
Judgement and knowledge is needed in selecting the statistical methods to use when the models are developed or revised.
The impairment allowance reected in the financial statements for these portfolios is therefore considered to be reasonable and supportable.
The impairment charge reected in the income statement for these retail portfolios is 2,422m 2010: 3,296m: 2009: 3,919m and amounts to 64% 2010: 59%: 2009: 53% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances in 2011.
For individually significant assets, impairment allowances are calculated on an individual basis and all relevant considerations that have a bearing on the expected future cash ows are taken into account for example, the business prospects for the customer, the realisable value of collateral, the Groups position relative to other claimants, the reliability of customer information and the likely cost and duration of the work-out process.
The level of the impairment allowance is the difference between the value of the discounted expected future cash ows discounted at the loans original effective interest rate, and its carrying amount.
Subjective judgements are made in the calculation of future cash ows.
Furthermore, judgements change with time as new information becomes available or as work-out strategies evolve, resulting in frequent revisions to the impairment allowance as individual decisions are taken.
Changes in these estimates would result in a change in the allowances and have a direct impact on the impairment charge.
The impairment charge reected in the financial statements in relation to wholesale portfolios is 1,368m 2010: 2,329m: 2009: 3,439m and amounts to 36% 2010: 41%: 2009: 47% of the total impairment charge on loans and advances.
Further information on impairment allowances and related credit information is set out within the Credit Risk Management section.

com annualreport 213 9 UK bank levy UK legislation was enacted in July 2011 to introduce an annual bank levy, which applies to elements of the Groups consolidated liabilities and equity held as at the year end.
The levy has resulted in an additional charge to the income statement of 325m, which was recognised as at 31 December 2011 and is presented within operating expenses.
The IFRS Interpretations Committee is considering the timing of recognition of the levy going forward.
10 Loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures On 25 October 2011, Barclays completed the disposal of Barclays Bank Russia as part of refocusing its Russian activities.
A loss on disposal of 73m has been recognised in the income statement within Barclays Corporate and the accumulated foreign exchange losses of 23m, previously recognised directly in equity, have been recycled through the income statement within Head Ofce Functions.
11 Tax Accounting for income taxes Barclays applies IAS 12 Income Taxes in accounting for taxes on income.
Income tax payable on taxable profits Current Tax is recognised as an expense in the period in which the profits arise.
Withholding taxes are also treated as income taxes.
Income tax recoverable on tax allowable losses is recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offset against taxable profits arising in the current or prior period.
Current tax is measured using tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising from the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and legislation enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset when there is both a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.

Barclays voluntarily disclosed the transaction to HMRC and, as at 31 December 2011, held a provision for the potential tax payable in relation to the debt buy-back.
If the legislation had been enacted as at 31 December 2011 it would not have had a material impact on the Groups 2011 results.
Tax relating to each component of other comprehensive income can be found in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, which includes within Other a tax credit of 74m 2010: 59m: 2009: 218m, principally relating to share based payments.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities The deferred tax amounts on the balance sheet, after offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis, were as follows: 2011 2010 m m Barclays Group US Inc. tax group BGUS 1,039 875 US Branch of Barclays Bank PLC US Branch 704 197 Spanish tax group 696 496 Other 571 949 Deferred tax asset 3,010 2,517 Deferred tax liability 695 514 Net deferred tax 2,315 2,003 The deferred tax asset increased by 20% in 2011 largely due to the improved financial performance in the US Branch resulting in a deferred tax asset in 2011 not previously recognised.
There is no net deferred tax asset in the UK.
Notes a In 2010 205m 2009: nil was previously included in the effect of non-UK profits or losses at local statutory rates that differ from the UK rate and related to a deferred tax benefit on the reorganisation of Spanish securitisation nancing.
This benefit is now included in other items including non-deductible expenses.
b This is a new item in the reconciliation to show the impact of non-creditable taxes mainly relating to the impact of withholding taxes.
In 2010 420m 2009: 175m was previously included in non-taxable gains and income, 72m 2009: nil was previously included in other items including non-deductible expenses and 38 m 2009: nil was previously included in the effect of non-UK profits or losses at local statutory rates that differ from the UK rate.
c This is a new item in the reconciliation to show the impact of non-deductible impairments charges, loss on disposals and the UK bank levy.
In 2010 non-deductible impairment charges of 68m 2009: 19m was previously included in other items including non-deductible expenses.
com annualreport 215 11 Tax continued US deferred tax assets in BGUS and the US Branch The deferred tax asset in BGUS and the US Branch includes amounts relating to tax losses of 329m and 603m respectively, which first arose in 2007.
In accordance with US tax rules tax losses can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 20 years and therefore any unused tax losses may begin to expire in 2028.
The remaining balance primarily relates to temporary differences which are not time limited.
The deferred tax asset for the US Branch has been measured using a marginal tax rate being the excess of the US tax rate a combination of Federal, City and State taxes over the UK statutory rate.
BGUS is forecast to return to profitability in 2012, primarily driven by BCI, its US Broker Dealer, with tax losses expected to be fully utilised by 2014.
2011 losses were driven in a large part by macroeconomic conditions, affected by the European sovereign debt crisis and regulatory uncertainty, as opposed to underlying business strategy.
A significant proportion of prior period losses related to real estate portfolios and businesses that have now been sold or liquidated.
profit forecasts reect the continued focus on operating as a premier full service global investment bank.
They also reect markets re-stabilising and returning to conditions similar to those in 2010.
Included in these projections are revenue assumptions based on maintaining our current share in FICC and certain growth prospects that exist in IBD and Equities.
Cost projections reect savings based on continuing initiatives in this area as well as further costs associated with increased levels of liquidity for the US business.
As with any current forecast, there are significant uncertainties in relation to macroeconomic conditions and regulatory requirements.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profit would not extend the recovery period.
The assumptions used in the profit forecasts do not include any incremental tax planning strategies.
The tax losses in the US Branch primarily relate to losses on legacy credit market exposures, the majority of which the US Branch no longer holds.
The tax losses are projected to be fully utilised by 2016, based on profit forecasts covering the period from 2012 to 2014, with no profit growth assumed after 2014.
The underlying assumptions used in the forecast are consistent with those used for BGUS.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profit would extend the recovery period by 1 year to 2017.
Spain deferred tax asset The deferred tax asset in Spain includes 417m relating to tax losses incurred in 2010 and 2011.
In accordance with Spanish tax rules tax losses can be carried forward and offset against profits for a period of 18 years.
The 2010 losses are expected to be fully utilised by 2021 and the 2011 losses by 2024.
Additional tax losses are anticipated to arise in 2012 and 2013.
The recoverability of the deferred tax asset has been determined using business profit forecasts covering the period from 2012 to 2015, with a subsequent annual growth rate of 1% p. a.
The forecasts are consistent with those used for the purposes of the goodwill impairment assessment.
They reect the expected benets from changes in product mix and improved product pricing following the restructuring of the business during 2011, as well as impairment levels coming back into line with historical loan loss rates.
A 20% reduction in forecasted profits from 2015 would extend the recovery period of the 2010 and 2011 losses by 2 years to 2023 and 2026, respectively.
A reduction in profits of more than this may result in a partial impairment of the deferred tax asset, depending upon the timing of the reversal of deductible temporary differences.
The forecast assumptions do not include any incremental tax planning strategies.
216 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 11 Tax continued Other deferred tax assets The deferred tax asset of 571m 2010: 949m in other entities includes 144m 2010: 700m relating to tax losses carried forward.
Entities which have suffered a loss in either the current or prior year have a total deferred tax asset of 189m 2010: 344m relating to tax losses carried forward and temporary differences.
Recognition is based on profit forecasts which indicate that it is probable that the entities will have future taxable profits against which the losses and temporary differences can be utilised.
The table below shows movements on deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year.
The amounts are different from those disclosed in the balance sheet as they are presented before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
The amount of deferred tax liability expected to be settled after more than 12 months is 1,044m 2010: 911m.
The amount of deferred tax asset expected to be recovered after more than 12 months is 2,050m 2010: 1,645m.
These amounts are before offsetting asset and liability balances where there is a legal right to set-off and an intention to settle on a net basis.
Unrecognised deferred tax Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of gross deductible temporary differences of 1,163m 2010: 506m, and gross tax losses of 2,299m 2010: 6,178m which includes capital losses of 2,034m 2010: 1,607m.
Tax losses of 97m 2010: 70m expire within 5 years, 101m 2010: 239m expire within 6 to 10 years, 5m 2010: 4,262m expire within 11 to 20 years and 2,096m 2010: 1,607m can be carried forward indefinitely.
Unrecognised losses that expire within 11 to 20 years have decreased because of an increased recognition of the deferred tax asset in the US Branch as a result of improved financial performance.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits and gains will be available against which the Group can utilise benets.
Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of the Groups investments in subsidiaries and branches where remittance is not contemplated and for those associates and interests in joint ventures where it has been determined that no additional tax will arise.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is 703m 2010: 530m.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the Groups tax charge and worldwide provisions for income taxes necessarily involves a degree of estimation and judgement.
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain and cannot be determined until resolution has been reached with the relevant tax authority.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due after taking into account external advice where appropriate.
Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
These risks are managed in accordance with the Groups Tax Risk Framework.
Deferred tax assets have been recognised based on business profit forecasts.
Further detail on the recognition of deferred tax assets are provided on page 213.

The basic weighted average number of shares in issue for 2011 reects the full year impact of the exercise of 758 million warrants in 2010.
No warrants were exercised in 2011.
When calculating the diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares held in respect of Barclays PLC, totalling 538 million 2010: 733 million shares.
In addition, the profit attributable to equity holders of the parent is adjusted for the dilutive impact of the potential conversion of outstanding options held in respect of Absa Group Limited.
The decrease in the number of potential ordinary shares is primarily driven by the impact of the decrease in the average share price to 2.34 2010: 3.06 on both the 379 million 2010: 379 million unexercised warrants and the 867 million 2010: 795 million outstanding options granted under employee share schemes, which have strike prices ranging from 1.41 to 5.49 with an average of 3.71 2010: 4.01.
Of the total number of employee share options and share awards at 31 December 2011, 248 million were anti-dilutive 2010: 59 million.
13 Dividends on ordinary shares The Directors have approved a final dividend in respect of 2011 of 3.0p per ordinary share of 25p each, amounting to 366m 2010: 298m, which will be paid on 16 March 2012.
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 do not reect this dividend, which will be accounted for in shareholders equity as an appropriation of retained profits in the year ending 31 December 2012.
The 2011 financial statements include the 2011 interim dividends of 362m 2010: 355m and final dividend declared in relation to 2010 of 298m 2009: 176m.
14 Discontinued operations On 1 December 2009 the Group completed the sale of BGI to BlackRock, Inc. recognising a profit on disposal before tax of 6,331m.
The tax charge on the profit on disposal was 43m reecting the application of UK substantial shareholdings relief in accordance with UK tax law.
The consideration at completion was $15.2bn 9.5bn, including 37.567 million new BlackRock, Inc. shares.
Under the terms of the transaction Bob Diamond and John Varley were appointed to the BlackRock, Inc. Board, which comprises 17 directors.
As at 31 December 2011 the Group held an economic interest of 19.7% of BlackRock, Inc. and 2.2% of the voting rights.
Barclays may not acquire additional voting rights and must vote in accordance with the recommendations of the BlackRock, Inc. Board of Directors.
The Group is not deemed to exercise significant inuence and the investment has been accounted for as an available for sale equity investment.
The Group has provided BlackRock, Inc. with customary warranties and indemnities in connection with the sale.
Barclays will also continue to indemnify securities lending arrangements until 30 November 2012 included within contingent liabilities in Note 30 and provide support to certain BGI cash funds until December 2013 in the form of credit derivatives included within derivative liabilities in Note 17 and financial guarantees included within provisions in Note 29.
In addition, Barclays, BlackRock, Inc. and their respective afliates also enter into agreements and transactions with one another in the ordinary course of their respective businesses and on an arms length commercial basis, subject to applicable regulation and agreements with relevant regulators.

Fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price that would be paid to transfer a liability in an arms length transaction with a willing counterparty which may be an observable market price or, where there is no quoted price for the instrument, may be estimated based on available market data.
Detail regarding the Groups approach to managing market risk can be found on pages 121 to 129.

The carrying value of the total portfolio assets equals the carrying value of liabilities to customers under investment contracts shown in Note 19.
Any change in the value of assets results in an equal but opposite change in the value of amounts due to the policyholders.
Therefore, the Group is not exposed to the financial risks inherent in the investments.

They include swaps, forward rate agreements, futures, options and combinations of these instruments and primarily affect the Groups net interest income, net trading income, net fee and commission income and derivative assets and liabilities.
Notional amounts of the contracts are not recorded on the balance sheet.
The Groups objectives and policies on managing the risks that arise in connection with derivatives, including the policies for hedging, are discussed in the Risk Management section on pages 67 to 158.
Trading derivatives are managed within the Groups market risk management policies, which are outlined on pages 121 to 129.
The Groups exposure to credit risk arising from derivative contracts, as well as the Groups participation in exchange traded and over the counter derivatives markets are outlined in the Credit Risk section on page 107.
Accounting for derivatives The Group applies IAS 39.
All derivative instruments are held at fair value through profit or loss, except for derivatives held for risk management purposes in an effective hedge relationship see hedge accounting below.
This includes terms included in a contract or other financial asset or liability the host, which, had it been a standalone contract, would have had met the denition of a derivative.
These are separated from the host and accounted for in the same way as a derivative.
Hedge accounting The Group applies hedge accounting to represent, to the maximum possible extent permitted under accounting standards, the economic effects of its interest and currency risk management strategies.
Derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, exchange rate, commodity, and equity exposures and exposures to certain indices such as house price indices and retail price indices related to non-trading positions.
Where derivatives are held for risk management purposes, and when transactions meet the required criteria for documentation and hedge effectiveness, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting, cash ow hedge accounting, or hedging of a net investment in a foreign operation, as appropriate to the risks being hedged.
Fair value hedge accounting Changes in fair value of derivatives that qualify and are designated as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
The fair value changes adjust the carrying value of the hedged asset or liability held at amortised cost.
If hedge relationships no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
For fair value hedges of interest rate risk, the fair value adjustment to the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity of the previously designated hedge relationship using the effective interest method.
If the hedged item is sold or repaid, the unamortised fair value adjustment is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Cash ow hedge accounting For qualifying cash ow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash ow hedge is recognised initially in other comprehensive income, and then recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement immediately.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the hedged item is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was recognised in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments The Groups net investments in foreign operations, including monetary items accounted for as part of the net investment, are hedged for foreign currency risks using both derivatives and foreign currency borrowings.
Hedges of net investments are accounted for similarly to cash ow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is being recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion being recognised immediately in the income statement.
The cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in the income statement on the disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation, or other reductions in the Groups investment in the operation.
com annualreport 221 17 Derivative financial instruments continued Types of derivatives held Foreign exchange derivatives The Groups principal exchange rate related contracts are forward foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and currency options.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are agreements to buy or sell a specified quantity of foreign currency, usually on a specified future date at an agreed rate.
A currency swap generally involves the exchange, or notional exchange, of equivalent amounts of two currencies and a commitment to exchange interest periodically until the principal amounts are re-exchanged on a future date.
Currency options provide the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a xed amount of a currency at a specified exchange rate on or before a future date.
As compensation for assuming the option risk, the option writer generally receives a premium at the start of the option period.
Currency derivatives are primarily designated as hedges of the foreign currency risk of net investments in foreign operations.
Interest rate derivatives The Groups principal interest rate related contracts are interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements, basis swaps, caps, oors and swaptions.
Included in this product category are transactions that include combinations of these features.
An interest rate swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange xed rate and oating rate interest by means of periodic payments based upon a notional principal amount and the interest rates dened in the contract.
Certain agreements combine interest rate and foreign currency swap transactions, which may or may not include the exchange of principal amounts.
A basis swap is a form of interest rate swap, in which both parties exchange interest payments based on oating rates, where the oating rates are based upon different underlying reference indices.
In a forward rate agreement, two parties agree a future settlement of the difference between an agreed rate and a future interest rate, applied to a notional principal amount.
The settlement, which generally occurs at the start of the contract period, is the discounted present value of the payment that would otherwise be made at the end of that period.
Interest rate derivatives, designated as cash ow hedges, primarily hedge the exposure to cash ow variability from interest rates of variable rate loans to banks and customers, variable rate debt securities held and highly probable forecast nancing transactions and reinvestments.
Interest rate derivatives designated as fair value hedges primarily hedge the interest rate risk of xed rate borrowings in issue, xed rate loans to banks and customers and investments in xed rate debt securities held.
Credit derivatives The Groups principal credit derivative-related contracts include credit default swaps and total return swaps.
A credit derivative is an arrangement whereby the credit risk of an asset the reference asset is transferred to the seller of protection.
A credit default swap is a contract where the protection seller receives premium or interest-related payments in return for contracting to make payments to the protection buyer upon a dened credit event.
Credit events normally include bankruptcy, payment default on a reference asset or assets, or downgrades by a rating agency.
A total return swap is an instrument whereby the seller of protection receives the full return of the asset, including both the income and change in the capital value of the asset.
The buyer of the protection in return receives a predetermined amount.
Equity derivatives The Groups principal equity-related contracts are equity and stock index swaps and options including warrants, which are equity options listed on an exchange.
An equity swap is an agreement between two parties to exchange periodic payments, based upon a notional principal amount, with one side paying xed or oating interest and the other side paying based on the actual return of the stock or stock index.
An equity option provides the buyer with the right, but not the obligation, either to purchase or sell a specified stock, basket of stocks or stock index at a specified price or level on or before a specified date.
The Group also enters into fund-linked derivatives, being swaps and options whose underlings include mutual funds, hedge funds, indices and multi-asset portfolios.
Commodity derivatives The Groups principal commodity-related derivative contracts are swaps, options, forwards and futures.
The main commodities transacted are base metals, precious metals, oil and oil-related products, power and natural gas.
The Groups total derivative asset and liability position as reported on the balance sheet is as follows: Total derivatives 2011 2010 Notional Notional Fair value Fair value contract contract amount Assets Liabilities amount Assets Liabilities m m m m m m Total derivative assets liabilities held for trading 43,095,991 535,306 524,552 48,517,204 418,586 403,163 Total derivative assets liabilities held for risk management 243,534 3,658 3,358 240,353 1,733 2,353 Derivative assets liabilities 43,339,525 538,964 527,910 48,757,557 420,319 405,516 222 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.

The Group uses this classication for assets that are not derivatives and are not held for trading purposes or otherwise designated at fair value through profit or loss, or at amortised cost.
Dividends and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in the income statement in net interest income Note 3 or, net investment income Note 6.
On disposal, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is also included in net investment income.
For impairment of available for sale debt and equity investments, see Note 7, Credit impairment charges and impairment on available for sale assets.

Approximately US$3.0bn 2.0bn of this amount was recognised as part of the acquisition accounting and is included as an available for sale asset in the balance sheet.
As discussed in Note 31, Barclays entitlement to these assets was the subject of legal proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York the Court between the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. the Trustee and Barclays.
On 22 February 2011, the Court issued its Opinion in relation to the legal proceedings deciding some of the claims in the Trustees favour and some in favour of Barclays.
On 15 July 2011, the Court entered final Orders implementing its Opinion.
The final Orders provide that Barclays is not entitled to receive approximately US$2.4bn 1.6bn, and is only conditionally entitled to receive approximately US$0.8bn 0.5bn, of the undelivered assets.
In addition, the final Orders provide that Barclays is not entitled to approximately US$2.1bn 1.3bn of assets it had already received.
Barclays and the Trustee have each led a notice of appeal from the Courts adverse rulings.
There continues to be significant judgement involved in the valuation of this asset and uncertainty relating to the outcome of the appeal process.
The Group takes the view that the effective provision of US$1.2bn 0.8bn that is reected in its estimate of fair value is appropriate.
If the final Orders were to be unaffected by the appeals, Barclays estimates that after taking into account the US$1.2bn 0.8bn effective provision, its loss would be approximately US$4.3bn 2.8bn.
The valuation of this asset will be kept under review as legal proceedings progress.
19 Financial liabilities designated at fair value Accounting for liabilities designated at fair value through profit and loss In accordance with IAS 39, financial liabilities may be designated at fair value, with gains and losses taken to the income statement within net trading income Note 5 and net investment income Note 6.

com annualreport 225 20 Fair value of financial instruments Accounting for financial assets and liabilities fair values The Group applies IAS 39.
All financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date of initial recognition and, depending on the classication of the asset, may continue to be held at fair value either through profit or loss or other comprehensive income.
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, in an arms length transaction between knowledgeable willing parties.
Wherever possible, fair value is determined by reference to a quoted market price for that instrument.
For many of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, especially derivatives, quoted prices are not available, and valuation models are used to estimate fair value.
The models calculate the expected cash ows under the terms of each specic contract and then discount these values back to a present value.
These models use as their basis independently sourced market parameters including, for example, interest rate yield curves, equities and commodities prices, option volatilities and currency rates.
For financial liabilities measured at fair value, the carrying amount reects the effect on fair value of changes in own credit spreads derived from observable market data, such as spreads on Barclays issued bonds or credit default swaps.
Most market parameters are either directly observable or are implied from instrument prices.
The model may perform numerical procedures in the pricing such as interpolation when input values do not directly correspond to the most actively traded market trade parameters.
On initial recognition, it is presumed that the transaction price is the fair value unless there is observable information available in an active market to the contrary.
For valuations that have made use of significant unobservable inputs, the difference between the model valuation and the initial transaction price Day One profit is recognised in profit or loss either: on a straight-line basis over the term of the transaction, or over the period until all model inputs will become observable where appropriate: or released in full when previously unobservable inputs become observable.
Various factors inuence the availability of observable inputs and these may vary from product to product and change over time.
Factors include the depth of activity in the relevant market, the type of product, whether the product is new and not widely traded in the marketplace, the maturity of market modelling and the nature of the transaction bespoke or generic.
To the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are not observable in the market, the determination of fair value can be more subjective, dependant on the signicance of the unobservable input to the overall valuation.
Unobservable inputs are determined based on the best information available, for example by reference to similar assets, similar maturities or other analytical techniques.
The sensitivity of valuations used in the financial statements to reasonably possible changes in variables is shown on page 236.

The classication of a financial instrument is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are dened below.
Quoted market prices Level 1 Financial instruments are classied as Level 1 if their value is observable in an active market.
Such instruments are valued by reference to unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets where the quoted price is readily available, and the price represents actual and regularly occurring market transactions on an arms length basis.
An active market is one in which transactions occur with sufficient volume and frequency to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis.
This category includes liquid government bonds actively traded through an exchange or clearing house, actively traded listed equities and actively exchange-traded derivatives.
Valuation technique using observable inputs Level 2 Financial instruments classied as Level 2 have been valued using models whose inputs are observable in an active market.
Valuations based on observable inputs include financial instruments such as swaps and forwards which are valued using market standard pricing techniques, and options that are commonly traded in markets where all the inputs to the market standard pricing models are observable.
This category includes most investment grade and liquid high yield bonds, certain asset backed securities, US agency securities, government bonds, less actively traded listed equities, bank, corporate and municipal obligations, certain OTC derivatives, certain convertible bonds, certicates of deposit, commercial paper, collateralised loan obligations CLOs, most commodities based derivatives, credit derivatives, certain credit default swaps CDSs, most fund units, certain loans, foreign exchange spot and forward transactions and certain issued notes.
Notes a The carrying value of financial assets measured at amortised cost including loans and advances, and other lending such as reverse repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities borrowed is determined in accordance with the accounting policy noted on pages 238 to 239.
Fair value is determined using discounted cash ows, applying market derived interest rates.
Alternatively, the fair value is determined by applying an average of available regional and industry segmental credit spreads to the loan portfolio, taking the contractual maturity of the loan facilities into consideration.
b The carrying value of financial liabilities measured at amortised cost including customer accounts and other deposits such as repurchase agreements and cash collateral on securities lent, debt securities in issue and subordinated liabilities is determined in accordance with the accounting policy noted on page 238.
Fair values of other debt securities in issue are based on quoted prices where available, or where these are unavailable, are estimated using a valuation model.
Fair values for dated and undated convertible and non convertible loan capital are based on quoted market rates for the issue concerned or similar issues with terms and conditions.
com annualreport 227 20 Fair value of financial instruments continued Valuation technique using significant unobservable inputs Level 3 Financial instruments are classied as Level 3 if their valuation incorporates significant inputs that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.
Such inputs are generally determined based on observable inputs of a similar nature, historical observations on the level of the input or other analytical techniques.
This category includes certain corporate debt securities, distressed debt, private equity investments, commercial real estate loans, certain OTC derivatives requiring complex and unobservable inputs such as correlations and long dated volatilities, certain convertible bonds, certain CDS, derivative exposures to monoline insurers, certain fund units, certain asset backed securities, certain issued notes, certain CDOs synthetic and some cash underlyings, certain CLOs and certain loans.

This process covers all fair value positions and is a key control in ensuring the material accuracy of valuations.
Price verication uses independently sourced data that is deemed most representative of the market.
The characteristics against which the data source is assessed are independence, reliability, consistency with other sources and evidence that the data represents an executable price.
The most current data available at balance sheet date is used.
Where significant variances are noted in the independent price verication process, an adjustment is taken to the fair value position.
Additional fair value adjustments may be taken to reect such factors as bid-offer spreads, market data uncertainty, model limitations and counterparty risk.
Independent price verication results and fair value adjustments are reported on a monthly basis to the Valuation Committee.
This committee is responsible for overseeing valuation and fair value adjustment policy within Corporate and Investment Banking and this is the forum to which valuation issues are escalated.
The Valuation Committee delegates more detailed review to the following five Sub-Committees: Independent Valuations, Legacy and Other Assets, Litigation Risk, Models, and Governance.
The Independent Valuations Sub-Committee reviews the results of the independent price verication and fair value adjustments process on a monthly basis.
This includes, but is not limited to, reviewing fair value adjustments and methodologies, independent price verication results, limits and valuation uncertainty.
The Legacy and Other Assets Sub-Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation and measurement issues arising in legacy assets, certain AFS positions and other assets as delegated by the Valuation Committee.
The Litigation Risk Sub-Committee is responsible for overseeing the valuation and measurement issues arising from legal risks within Barclays Corporate and Investment Banking.
The Models Sub-Committee is responsible for overseeing policies and controls related to the use of valuation models.
This includes but is not limited to review of global model risk reports, the trade approval process and model validation, model-related fair value adjustments, and independent price verication variances or collateral disputes relating to model usage.
The Governance Sub-Committee is responsible for overseeing the governance of valuation processes, policies and procedures.
This Sub-Committee monitors the development of the Valuation control framework, completeness of balance sheet oversight and appropriate representation of Senior Management at the Valuation Committee and each of the above referenced Sub-Committees.

com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 20 Fair value of financial instruments continued Valuation techniques Current year valuation methodologies were consistent with the prior year unless otherwise noted below.
These methodologies are commonly used by market participants.
The valuation techniques used for the main products that are not determined by reference to unadjusted quoted prices Level 1, are described below.
Commercial real estate loans This category includes lending on a range of commercial property types including retail, hotel, ofce, multi-family and industrial properties.
Performing loans are valued using a spread-based approach, with consideration of characteristics such as property type, geographic location, yields, credit quality and property performance reviews.
Where there is significant uncertainty regarding loan performance, valuation is based on the underlying collateral, whose value is determined through property-specic information such as third party valuation reports and bids for the underlying properties.
Since each commercial real estate loan is unique in nature and the secondary commercial loan market is relatively illiquid, valuation inputs are generally considered unobservable.
Asset backed products These are debt and derivative products that are linked to the cash ows of a pool of referenced assets via securitisation.
This category includes residential mortgage backed securities, commercial mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, CDOs collateralised debt obligations, CLOs collateralised loan obligations and derivatives with cash ows linked to securitisations.
Where available, valuations are based on observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes and inter-dealer prices.
Otherwise, valuations are determined using industry standard cash ow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These inputs are determined by reference to a number of sources including proxying to observed transactions, market indices or market research, and by assessing underlying collateral performance.
Proxying to observed transactions, indices or research requires an assessment and comparison of the relevant securities underlying attributes including collateral, tranche, vintage, underlying asset composition historical losses, borrower characteristics, and loan attributes such as loan-to-value ratio and geographic concentration and credit ratings original and current.
Other credit products These products are linked to the credit spread of a referenced entity, index or basket of referenced entities.
This category includes synthetic CDOs, single name and index CDS and Nth to default basket swaps.
Within this population, valuation inputs are unobservable for CDS with illiquid reference assets and certain synthetic CDOs.
CDS are valued using a market standard model that incorporates the credit curve as its principal input.
Credit spreads are observed directly from broker data, third party vendors or priced to proxies.
Where credit spreads are unobservable, they are determined with reference to recent transactions or bond spreads from observable issuances of the same issuer or other similar entities as a proxy.
Synthetic CDOs are valued using a model that calculates fair value based on observable and unobservable parameters including credit spreads, recovery rates, correlations and interest rates and is calibrated daily.
For index and bespoke synthetic CDOs with unobservable inputs, correlation is set with reference to the index tranche market.
Derivative exposure to monoline insurers These products are derivatives through which credit protection has been purchased on structured debt instruments primarily CLOs from monoline insurers.
The value of the CDS is derived from the value of the cash instrument that it protects.
A valuation adjustment is then applied to reect the counterparty credit risk associated with the relevant monoline.
This adjustment is calculated using an assessment of the likely recovery of the protected cash security, which is derived from a scenario-based calculation of the mark-to-market of the instrument using an appropriate valuation model: and the probability of default and loss given default of the monoline counterparty, as estimated from independent fundamental credit analysis.
Due to the counterparty credit risk associated with these insurers, derivative exposure to monoline counterparty insurers is generally considered unobservable.
com annualreport 233 20 Fair value of financial instruments continued Non-asset backed debt instruments These are government bonds, US agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper, certicates of deposit, convertible bonds, notes and other non-asset backed bonds.
Within this population, valuation inputs are unobservable for certain convertible bonds and corporate bonds.
Liquid government bonds actively traded through an exchange or clearing house are marked to the closing levels observed in these markets.
Less liquid government bonds, US agency bonds, corporate bonds, commercial paper and certicates of deposit are valued using observable market prices which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services.
Where there are no observable market prices, fair value is determined by reference to either issuances or CDS spreads of the same issuer as proxy inputs to obtain discounted cash ow amounts.
In the absence of observable bond or CDS spreads for the respective issuer, similar reference assets or sector averages are applied as a proxy the appropriateness of proxies being assessed based on issuer, coupon, maturity and industry.
Convertible bonds are valued using prices observed through broker sources, market data services and trading activity.
Where reliable external sources are not available, fair value is determined using a spread to the equity conversion value or the value of the bond without the additional equity conversion.
The spread level is determined with reference to similar proxy assets.
Fair valued issued notes are valued using discounted cash ow techniques and industry standard models incorporating various observable input parameters depending on the terms of the instrument.
Any unobservable inputs generally have insignicant impact on the overall valuation.
Equity products This category includes listed equities, exchange traded equity derivatives, OTC equity derivatives, preference shares and contracts for difference.
OTC equity derivatives valuations are determined using industry standard models.
The models calculate fair value based on input parameters such as stock prices, dividends, volatilities, interest rates, equity repo curves and, for multi-asset products, correlations.
In general, input parameters are deemed observable up to liquid maturities which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying instrument.
Unobservable model inputs are determined by reference to liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk prole.
Private equity Private equity investments are valued in accordance with the International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines.
This requires the use of a number of individual pricing benchmarks such as the prices of recent transactions in the same or similar entities, discounted cash ow analysis, and comparison with the earnings multiples of listed comparative companies.
Unobservable inputs include earnings estimates, multiples of comparative companies, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Model inputs are based on market conditions at the reporting date.
The valuation of unquoted equity instruments is subjective by nature.
However, the relevant methodologies are commonly applied by other market participants and have been consistently applied over time.
Full valuations are performed at least bi-annually, with the portfolio reviewed on a monthly basis for material events that might impact upon fair value.
Funds and fund-linked products This category includes holdings in hedge funds, funds of funds, and fund derivatives.
Fund derivatives are derivatives whose underlyings include mutual funds, hedge funds, fund indices and multi-asset portfolios.
They are valued using underlying fund prices, yield curves and other available market information.
In general, fund holdings are valued based on the latest available valuation received from the fund administrator.
Funds are deemed unobservable where the fund is either suspended, in wind-down, has a redemption restriction that severely affects liquidity, or where the latest net asset value from the fund administrators is more than three months old.
In the case of illiquid fund holdings the valuation will take account of all available information in relation to the underlying fund or collection of funds and maybe adjusted relative to the performance of relevant index benchmarks.
Foreign exchange products These products are derivatives linked to the foreign exchange market.
This category includes forward contracts, FX swaps and FX options.
Exotic derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models.
Input parameters include FX rates, interest rates, FX volatilities, interest rate volatilities, FX interest rate correlations and others as appropriate.
Certain correlations and long dated forward and volatilities are unobservable.
Unobservable model inputs are set by referencing liquid market instruments and applying extrapolation techniques to match the appropriate risk prole.
234 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 20 Fair value of financial instruments continued Interest rate products These are products linked to interest rates or ination indices.
This category includes interest rate and ination swaps, swaptions, caps, oors, ination options, balance guaranteed swaps and other exotic interest rate derivatives.
Interest rate products are valued using standard discounted cash ow techniques.
Interest rate derivative cash ows are valued using interest rate yield curves whereby observable market data is used to construct the term structure of forward rates.
This is then used to project and discount future cash ows based on the parameters of the trade.
Instruments with optionality are valued using a volatility surface constructed from market observable inputs.
Exotic interest rate derivatives are valued using industry standard and bespoke models based on observable market parameters which are determined separately for each parameter and underlying instrument.
Where unobservable, a parameter will be set with reference to an observable proxy.
Ination forward curves and interest rate yield curves are extrapolated beyond observable tenors.
Balance guaranteed swaps are valued using cash ow models that calculate fair value based on loss projections, prepayment, recovery and discount rates.
These parameters are determined by reference to underlying asset performance, independent research, ABX indices, broker quotes, observable trades on similar securities and third party pricing sources.
Prepayment is projected based on observing historic prepayment.
During 2010, in line with changes in market practice, the methodology for valuing certain collateralised interest rate products was updated to make use of more relevant interest rate yield curves to discount cash ows.
For certain collateralised derivatives, Overnight Indexed Swap OIS rates were used rather than other market reference rates such as LIBOR.
During 2011, in line with market practice, the methodology for valuing certain collateralised interest rate products was further amended to reect the impact of cheapest to deliver collateral on discounting curves, where counterparty CSA Credit Support Annex agreements specify the right of the counterparty to choose the currency of collateral posted.
Commodity products These products are exchange traded and OTC derivatives based on underlying commodities such as metals, crude oil and rened products, agricultural, power and natural gas.
The valuations of certain commodity swaps and options are determined using models incorporating discounting of cash ows and other industry standard modelling techniques.
Valuation inputs include forward curves, volatility surfaces and tenor correlation.
Within this population, certain forward curves and volatility surfaces for longer dated exposures are unobservable.
These unobservable inputs are set with reference to similar observable products or by applying extrapolation techniques from the observable market.
Other This category is largely made up of xed rate loans, which are valued using models that discount expected future cash ows.
These models calculate fair value based on observable interest rates and unobservable credit spreads.
Unobservable credit spreads are determined by extrapolating observable spreads.
The receivables resulting from the acquisition of the North American businesses of Lehman Brothers is included within Other.
For more details, refer to Note 31 Legal Proceedings.
Complex derivative instruments Valuation estimates made by counterparties with respect to complex derivative instruments, for the purpose of determining the amount of collateral to be posted, often differ, sometimes signicantly, from Barclays own estimates.
In almost all cases, Barclays has been able to successfully resolve such differences or otherwise reach an accommodation with respect to collateral posting levels, including in certain cases by entering into compromise collateral arrangements.
Due to the ongoing nature of collateral calls, Barclays will often be engaged in discussions with one or more counterparties in respect of such differences at any given time.
Valuation estimates made by counterparties for collateral purposes are, like any other third-party valuation, considered when determining Barclays own fair value estimates.
Fair value adjustments The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are described below: Bid-Offer valuation adjustments For assets and liabilities where the rm is not a market maker, mid prices are adjusted to bid and offer prices respectively.
Bid-offer adjustments reect expected close out strategy and, for derivatives, the fact that they are managed on a portfolio basis.
The methodology for determining the bid-offer adjustment for a derivative portfolio will generally involve netting between long and short positions and the bucketing of risk by strike and term in accordance with hedging strategy.
Bid-offer levels are derived from market sources, such as broker data.
For those assets and liabilities where the rm is a market maker and has the ability to transact at, or better than, mid price which is the case for certain equity, bond and vanilla derivative markets, the mid price is used, since the bid-offer spread does not represent a transaction cost.
Uncertainty adjustments Market data input for exotic derivatives may not have a directly observable bid offer spread.
In such instances, an uncertainty adjustment is applied as a proxy for the bid offer adjustment.
An example of this is correlation risk where an adjustment is required to reect the possible range of values that market participants apply.
The uncertainty adjustment may be determined by calibrating to derivative prices, or by scenario analysis or historical analysis.
com annualreport 235 20 Fair value of financial instruments continued Model valuation adjustments New valuation models are reviewed under the rms model governance framework.
This process identies the assumptions used and any model limitations for example, if the model does not incorporate volatility skew.
Where necessary, fair value adjustments will be applied to take these factors into account.
Model valuation adjustments are dependant on the size of portfolio, complexity of the model, whether the model is market standard and to what extent it incorporates all known risk factors.
All models and model valuation adjustments are subject to review on at least an annual basis.
Credit and debit valuation adjustments Credit valuation adjustments CVAs and debit valuation adjustments DVAs are incorporated into derivative valuations to reect the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and Barclays own credit quality respectively.
These adjustments are modelled for OTC derivatives across all asset classes.
Calculations are derived from estimates of exposure at default, probability of default and recovery rates, on a counterparty basis.
Counterparties include but are not limited to corporates, monolines, sovereigns and sovereign agencies, supranationals, and special-purpose vehicles.
Whereas in 2010 certain highly-rated sovereigns, supra-nationals and government agencies were excluded from the CVA calculation, following the sovereign debt crisis it has been considered appropriate to include these entities, for which the impact of doing so was a 79m increase in the CVA.
Exposure at default is generally based on expected positive exposure, estimated through the simulation of underlying risk factors.
For some complex products, where this approach is not feasible, simplifying assumptions are made, either through proxying with a more vanilla structure, or using current or scenario-based mark-to-market as an estimate of future exposure.
Where strong collateralisation agreement exists as a mitigant to counterparty risk, the exposure is set to zero.
Probability of default and recovery rate information is generally sourced from the CDS markets.
For counterparties where this information is not available, or considered unreliable due to the nature of the exposure, alternative approaches are taken based on mapping internal counterparty ratings onto historical or market-based default and recovery information.
In particular, this applies to sovereign related names where the effect of using the recovery assumptions implied in CDS levels would imply a 300m increase in CVA.
Correlation between counterparty credit and underlying derivative risk factors may lead to a systematic bias in the valuation of counterparty credit risk, termed wrong-way or right-way risk.
This is not incorporated into the CVA calculation, but is monitored regularly via scenario analysis and has been found to be immaterial.
Own credit adjustments The carrying amount of issued notes that are designated under the IAS 39 fair value option is adjusted to reect the effect of changes in own credit spreads.
The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement.
For funded instruments such as issued notes, mid-level credit spreads on Barclays issued bonds are the basis for this adjustment.
At 31 December 2011, the own credit adjustment arose from the fair valuation of Barclays financial liabilities designated at fair value.
Barclays credit spreads widened during 2011, leading to a profit of 2,708m 2010: 391m from the fair value of changes primarily in own credit itself but also reecting the effects of foreign exchange rates, time decay and trade activity.
Unrecognised gains as a result of the use of valuation models using unobservable inputs The amount that has yet to be recognised in income that relates to the difference between the transaction price the fair value at initial recognition and the amount that would have arisen had valuation models using unobservable inputs been used on initial recognition, less amounts subsequently recognised, is as follows: Year ended 31 December 2011 2010 m m Opening balance 137 99 Additions 93 56 Amortisation and releases 113 18 Closing balance 117 137 Critical accounting estimates and judgements Quoted market prices are not available for many of the financial assets and liabilities that are held at fair value and the Group uses a variety of techniques to estimate the fair value.
The above note describes the more judgemental aspects of valuation in the period, including: credit valuation adjustments on monoline exposures, commercial real estate loans, private equity investments, and fair value loans to government and business and other services.
The following sensitivity analysis is performed on products with significant unobservable parameters Level 3 to generate a range of reasonably possible alternative valuations.
These numbers are calculated before taking advantage of any diversication in the portfolio.

The methodologies applied take account of the nature of valuation techniques used, as well as the availability and reliability of observable proxy and historical data.
Sensitivities are calculated without reecting the impact of any diversication in the portfolio.
The effect of stressing unobservable inputs to a range of reasonably possible alternatives would be to increase fair values by up to 2.0bn 2010: 1.7bn or to decrease fair values by up to 2.1bn 2010: 1.8bn with substantially all the potential effect impacting profit and loss rather than equity.
Sensitivities are dynamically calculated on a monthly basis.
The calculation is based on a range, standard deviation or spread data of a reliable reference source or a scenario based on alternative market views.
The level of shift or scenarios applied is considered for each product and varied according to the quality of the data and variability of underlying market.
The approach adopted in determining these sensitivities has continued to evolve during the year, in the context of changing market conditions.
Commercial real estate loans Sensitivity is determined by applying an adjusted spread of 15% for each loan both up and down.
The adjusted spread is derived from loan origination spreads provided by independent market research.
For non-performing loans, a plausible worst-case valuation is determined from the history of third-party valuation reports or bids received.
Asset backed products The sensitivity analysis for asset backed products is based on bid offer ranges dened at the asset class level which take into account security level liquidity.
Half of the observed bid offer range is multiplied by the market value of the position to calculate the valuation sensitivity.
Where there is no observable bid offer data, price movements on appropriate indices are used.
Sensitivity is based on the average of the largest upward and downward price movement in the preceding 12 month period.
com annualreport 237 20 Fair value of financial instruments continued Other credit products The sensitivity of valuations of the illiquid CDS portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each underlying reference asset.
The shift is based upon the average bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar CDS.
Bespoke Collateralised Synthetic Obligation CSO sensitivity is calculated using correlation levels derived from the range of contributors to a consensus bespoke service.
Derivative exposure to monoline insurers Sensitivity is measured by stressing inputs to the counterparty valuation adjustment including our expected exposures and the probability of default of the monoline derivative counterparty.
The modelled expected exposures are stressed by shifting the recovery rate assumptions on the underlying protected assets.
The probability of default of the monoline derivative counterparty is stressed by shifting the internal default curve, which is generated through the analysis performed by credit risk management.
Non-asset backed debt instruments The sensitivity for convertible bonds is determined by applying a shift to each underlying position based upon the bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar bonds.
The sensitivity for corporate bonds portfolio is determined by applying a shift to each underlying position driven by average bid offer spreads observed in the market for similar bonds.
Equity products Sensitivity is estimated based on the dispersion of consensus data services either directly or through proxies.
Private equity The relevant valuation models are each sensitive to a number of key assumptions, such as projected future earnings, comparator multiples, marketability discounts and discount rates.
Valuation sensitivity is estimated by exing such assumptions to reasonable alternative levels and determining the impact on the resulting valuation.
Funds and fund-linked products Sensitivity is calculated on an individual fund basis using a loss based scenario approach which factors in the underlying assets of the specic fund and assumed recovery rates.
Foreign exchange products Sensitivity relating to unobservable valuation inputs is based on the dispersion of consensus data services.
Interest rate products Sensitivity relating to the valuation of the products is mainly driven from the dispersion of the consensus data.
Commodity products Sensitivity is determined primarily by measuring historical variability over two years.
The estimate is calculated using data for short dated parameter curves to generate best and worst case scenarios.
Where historical data is unavailable or uncertainty is due to volumetric risk, sensitivity is measured by applying appropriate stress scenarios or using proxy bid-offer spread levels.
Other The sensitivity for xed rate loans is calculated by applying a 25% shift in borrower credit spreads.
No stress has been applied to the receivables relating to the Lehman acquisition refer to Note 18.
Due to the uncertainty inherent in legal proceedings, it is not possible to identify reasonable upside and downside stresses on a basis comparable with the other assets analysed.
The sensitivity for credit valuation adjustments is calculated by assessing the impact on the counterparty credit spreads of stressing their credit ratings by two ratings notches.

For more information about the Groups funding and liquidity position, see Liquidity risk and Capital risk on pages 139 to 150 and pages 130 to 138.
Accounting for financial instruments held at amortised cost Loans and advances to customers and banks, customer accounts, debt securities and the majority of other financial liabilities, are held at amortised cost.
That is, the initial fair value which is normally the amount advanced or borrowed is adjusted for repayments and the amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the asset or liability.

22 Finance leases Accounting for finance leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases in accounting for finance leases, both where it is the lessor or the lessee.
A finance lease is a lease which confers substantially all the risks and rewards of the leased asset on the lessee.
Where the Group is the lessor, the leased asset is not held on the balance sheet: instead a finance lease receivable is recognised representing the minimum lease payments receivable under the terms of the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Where the Group is the lessee, the leased asset is recognised in property, plant and equipment and a finance lease liability is recognised, representing the minimum lease payments payable under the lease, discounted at the rate of interest implicit in the lease.
Interest income or expense is recognised in interest receivable or payable, allocated to accounting periods to reect a constant periodic rate of return.
Finance lease receivables Finance lease receivables are included within loans and advances to customers.
The Group specialises in asset-based lending and works with a broad range of international technology, industrial equipment and commercial companies to provide customised finance programmes to assist manufacturers, dealers and distributors of assets.

As at 31 December 2011, the carrying amount of assets held under finance leases was 28m 2010: 29m.
23 Reclassication of financial assets held for trading Accounting for the reclassication of financial assets held for trading In accordance with IAS 39, where the Group no longer intends to trade in financial assets it may transfer them out of the held for trading classication and measure them at amortised cost if they meet the denition of a loan.
The initial value used for the purposes of establishing amortised cost is fair value on the date of the transfer.
Prior to 2010, the Group reclassied certain financial assets, originally classied as held for trading that were deemed to be not held for trading purposes to loans and receivables.
There were no reclassications of financial assets during 2011 or 2010.
The carrying value of the securities previously reclassied into loans and receivables has decreased from 8,625m to 7,652m primarily as a result of sales, paydowns and maturities of the underlying securities, and increases due to the reversal of the discount on reclassication.
Sales of securities from the 16 December 2008 reclassication totalled 91m 31 December 2010: 390m and sales of securities from the 25 November 2009 reclassication totalled 482m 31 December 2010: 178m.

The reclassied financial assets contributed 396m 2010: 359m to interest income.
24 Reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing Reverse repurchase agreements and stock borrowing or similar transaction are a form of secured lending whereby the Group provides a loan or cash collateral in exchange for the transfer of collateral, generally in the form of marketable securities subject to an agreement to transfer the securities back at a xed price in the future.
Repurchase agreements are where the Group obtains such loans or cash collateral, in exchange for the transfer of collateral.
Accounting for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements including other similar lending and borrowing The Group purchases a reverse repurchase agreement or borrows securities subject to a commitment to resell or return them.
The securities are not included in the balance sheet as the Group does not acquire the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration paid or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a loan asset at amortised cost.
The Group may also sell a repurchase agreement or lend securities subject to a commitment to repurchase or redeem them.
The securities are retained on the balance sheet as the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Consideration received or cash collateral provided is accounted for as a financial liability at amortised cost.

25 Property, plant and equipment Accounting for property, plant and equipment The Group applies IAS 16 Property Plant and Equipment and IAS 40 Investment Properties.
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, which includes direct and incremental acquisition costs less accumulated depreciation and provisions for impairment, if required.
Subsequent costs are capitalised if these result in the enhancement to the asset.
Depreciation is provided on the depreciable amount of items of property, plant and equipment on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful economic lives.
Depreciation rates, methods and the residual values underlying the calculation of depreciation of items of property, plant and equipment are kept under review to take account of any change in circumstances.
Following a review in 2011, the depreciation rates for certain categories of xed assets were revised to reect their currently expected useful lives.
The impact of the change was not material.
The Group uses the following annual rates in calculating depreciation: Annual rates in calculating depreciation Depreciation rate Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings and long-leasehold property more than 50 years to run 2-3.3% Leasehold property over the remaining life of the lease less than 50 years to run Over the remaining life of the lease a Costs of adaptation of freehold and leasehold property 6-10% a Equipment installed in freehold and leasehold property 6-10% Computers and similar equipment 17-33% Fixtures and ttings and other equipment 9-20% Investment property The Group initially recognises investment property at cost, and subsequently at their fair value at each balance sheet date reecting market conditions at the reporting date.

The fair value of investment property is determined by reference to current market prices for similar properties, adjusted as necessary for condition and location, or by reference to recent transactions updated to reect current economic conditions.
Discounted cash ow techniques may be employed to calculate fair value where there have been no recent transactions, using current external market inputs such as market rents and interest rates.
Valuations are carried out by management with the support of appropriately qualied independent valuers.
242 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 26 Goodwill and intangible assets Accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill is determined in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations and IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Goodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the Groups share of the assets acquired and the liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed on the date of the acquisition.
Goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently when there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
The test involves comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the present value of the pre-tax cash ows, discounted at a rate of interest that reects the inherent risks, of the cash generating unit to which the goodwill relates, or the cash generating units fair value if this is higher.
Intangible assets The accounting standard that the Group applies in accounting for intangible assets other than goodwill is IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Intangible assets include brands, customer lists, licences and other contracts, core deposit intangibles and mortgage servicing rights.
They are initially recognised when they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights, the cost can be measured reliably and, in the case of intangible assets not acquired in a business combination, where it is probable that future economic benets attributable to the assets will ow from their use.
Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when there are indications that impairment may have incurred.
They are stated at cost which is, in the case of assets acquired in a business combination, the acquisition date fair value less amortisation and provisions for impairment, if any, and are amortised over their useful lives in a manner that reects the pattern to which they contribute to future cash ows, generally over 4-25 years.
com annualreport 243 26 Goodwill and intangible assets continued Goodwill Goodwill is allocated to business operations according to business segments as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK RBB 3,145 3,148 Europe RBB 64 505 Africa RBB 1,078 1,307 Barclaycard 505 585 Barclays Capital 102 133 Barclays Corporate 20 150 Barclays Wealth 391 391 Total net book value of goodwill 5,305 6,219 Impairment testing of goodwill Total impairment charges of 597m 2010: 243m charge relating to Barclays Bank Russia have been recognised during the year as the recoverable amount of goodwill in FirstPlus and Spain was not supported based on the value-in-use calculations.
The impairment charge of 47m 2010: nil in respect of all of the goodwill held by Barclaycard arising from the acquisition of FirstPlus reected the continued run-off of the loan portfolio and the impact of the payment protection insurance redress.
Further details on the impairment of Spain goodwill are set out below.
Key assumptions The key assumptions used for impairment testing are set out below for each significant goodwill balance.
Other goodwill of 1,133m 2010: 1,253m was allocated to multiple cash-generating units which are not considered individually significant.
UK RBB At 31 December 2011, goodwill relating to Woolwich was 3,130m 2010: 3,130m of the total UK RBB balance.
The recoverable amount of Woolwich has been determined using cash ow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five year period, with a terminal growth rate of 3% 2010: 2% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash ows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 13% 2010: 13%.
Based on these assumptions, the recoverable amount exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 8.7bn 2010: 4.0bn.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate would reduce the recoverable amount by 1.4bn 2010: 1.0bn and 0.9bn 2010: 0.8bn respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash ows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 1.5bn 2010: 1.1bn.
Africa RBB At 31 December 2011, goodwill relating to the Absa Group was 1,042m 2010: 1,271m of the total Africa RBB balance.
The recoverable amount of the Absa Group has been determined using cash ow predictions based on financial budgets approved by management and covering a five year period, with a terminal growth rate of 6% 2010: 6% applied thereafter.
The forecast cash ows have been discounted at a pre-tax rate of 14% 2010: 14%.
The recoverable amount calculated based on value in use exceeded the carrying amount including goodwill by 4.7bn 2010: 5.0bn.
A one percentage point change in the discount rate or the terminal growth rate would reduce the recoverable amount by 0.9bn 2010: 1.0bn and 0.7bn 2010: 0.8bn respectively.
A reduction in the forecast cash ows of 10% per annum would reduce the recoverable amount by 0.8bn 2010: 0.9bn.
Spain At 31 December 2011, Barclays recognised an impairment charge of 550m 2010: nil in respect of the whole goodwill balance held by Barclays Corporate 123m and Europe RBB 427m arising from the acquisitions of the Iberia Woolwich business in 2000 and Zaragozano in 2003.
The cashow forecasts were reassessed during the fourth quarter as a result of uncertainty in economic conditions in Spain and increased risk associated with the future cash ows.
The pre-tax discount rate was increased to 16% 2010: 12% and the long term growth rate was reduced to 1% 2010: 2%.
Based on these assumptions the value-in-use was no longer able to support the recognition of the goodwill and it was fully impaired as at 31 December 2011.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements Goodwill Testing goodwill for impairment involves a significant amount of estimation.
This includes the identication of independent cash generating units and the allocation of goodwill to these units based on which units are expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The allocation is reviewed following business reorganisation.
Cash ow projections necessarily take into account changes in the market in which a business operates including the level of growth, competitive activity and the impacts of regulatory change.
Determining both the expected pre-tax cash ows and the risk adjusted interest rate appropriate to the operating unit require the exercise of judgement.
The estimation of pre-tax cash ows is sensitive to the periods for which detailed forecasts are available and to assumptions regarding the long-term sustainable cash ows.
Other intangible assets Determining the estimated useful lives of intangible assets such as those arising from contractual relationships requires an analysis of circumstances and judgement.
The assessment of whether an asset is exhibiting indicators of impairment as well as the calculation of impairment, which requires the estimation of future cash ows and fair values less costs to sell, also requires the preparation of cash ow forecasts and fair values for assets that may not be regularly bought and sold.
The most significant amounts of intangible assets relate to Absa and Lehman Brothers North American businesses.
244 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 27 Operating leases Accounting for operating leases The Group applies IAS 17 Leases, for operating leases.
An operating lease is a lease where substantially all of the risks and rewards of the leased assets remain with the lessor.
Where the Group is the lessor, lease income is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
The Group holds the leased assets on balance sheet within property, plant and equipment.
Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term unless another systematic basis is more appropriate.
Operating lease receivables The Group acts as lessor, whereby items of plant and equipment are purchased and then leased to third parties under arrangements qualifying as operating leases.
The future minimum lease payments expected to be received under non-cancellable operating leases as at 31 December 2011 was 14m 2010: 43m.
Operating lease commitments The Group leases various ofces, branches and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
With such operating lease arrangements, the asset is kept on the lessors balance sheet and the Group reports the future minimum lease payments as an expense over the lease term.
The leases have various terms, escalation and renewal rights.
There are no contingent rents payable.
Operating lease rentals of 659m 2010: 637m have been included in administration and general expenses.
The future minimum lease payments by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 2011 2010 Property Equipment Property Equipment m m m m Not more than one year 585 12 628 7 Over one year but not more than five years 1,673 2 1,477 2 Over five years 2,830 3,146 Total 5,088 14 5,251 9 Total future minimum sublease payments to be received under non-cancellable subleases as at 31 December 2011 was 121m 2010: 111m.
com annualreport 245 Accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities The section describes the Groups accruals, provisions and contingent liabilities arising from its banking and insurance businesses.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation, and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities reect potential liabilities that are not recognised on the balance sheet.
28 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities 2011 2010 m m Accruals and deferred income 4,959 5,539 Other creditors 5,171 5,198 Obligations under finance leases see Note 22 64 87 Insurance contract liabilities, including unit-linked liabilities 2,386 2,409 Accruals, deferred income and other liabilities 12,580 13,233 Insurance liabilities relate principally to the Groups long-term business.
Insurance contract liabilities associated with the Groups short-term non-life business are 118m 2010: 131m.
The maximum amounts payable under all of the Groups insurance products, ignoring the probability of insured a a events occurring and the contribution from investments backing the insurance policies were 104bn 2010: 114bn or 82bn 2010: 95bn after a a reinsurance.
Of this insured risk 89bn 2010: 99bn or 69bn 2010: 82bn after reinsurances was concentrated in short-term insurance contracts in Africa.
The impact to the income statement and equity under a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used to calculate the insurance liabilities would be 8m 2010: 12m.
Accounting for insurance contracts The Group applies IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts to its insurance contracts.
An insurance contract is a contract that protects a third party against a loss from non-financial risk.
Some wealth management and other products, such as life assurance contracts, combine investment and insurance features: these are treated as insurance contracts when they pay benets that are at least 5% more than they would pay if the insured event does not occur.
Insurance liabilities include current best estimates of future contractual cash ows, claims handling, and administration costs in respect of claims.
Liability adequacy tests are performed at each balance sheet date to ensure the adequacy of contract liabilities.
Where a deficiency is highlighted by the tests, insurance liabilities are increased, any deficiency being recognised in the income statement.
Insurance premium revenue is recognised in the income statement in the period earned, net of reinsurance premiums payable, in net premiums from insurance contracts.
Increases and decreases in insurance liabilities are recognised in the income statement in net claims and benets on insurance contracts.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS The FSCS is the UKs compensation fund for customers of authorised financial services rms that are unable to pay claims.
The FSCS raises levies on all UK deposit taking institutions.
Previously compensation has been paid out by loan facilities provided by HM Treasury to FSCS in support of FSCSs obligations to the depositors of banks declared in default.
The outstanding loan facilities, totalling approximately 18.5bn, are to be reviewed from 1 April 2012 and the ongoing terms are still to be agreed with HM Treasury.
While it is anticipated that the substantial majority of these loans will be repaid wholly from recoveries from the institutions concerned, there is the risk of a shortfall, such that the FSCS may place additional levies on all FSCS participants.
Barclays has included an accrual of 58m in other liabilities as at 31 December 2011 2010: 63m in respect of levies raised by the FSCS, based on the indicative costs published by the FSCS.

com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 29 Provisions Accounting for provisions The Group applies IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets in accounting for non-financial liabilities.
Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is more likely than not that a transfer of economic resources will be necessary to settle the obligation, which can be reliably estimated.
Provision is made for the anticipated cost of restructuring, including redundancy costs when an obligation exists, i. e. when the Group has a detailed formal plan for restructuring a business and has raised valid expectations in those affected by the restructuring by announcing its main features or starting to implement the plan.
Provision is made for undrawn loan commitments if it is probable that the facility will be drawn and result in the recognition of an asset at an amount less than the amount advanced.
Provisions expected to be recovered or settled within no more than 12 months after 31 December 2011 were 1,260m 2010: 658m.
Provisions relating to taxation are included in current and deferred tax disclosures on pages 213 to 216.

On 9 May 2011, Barclays announced that it would not be participating in any application for permission to appeal against the High Court judgment and that Barclays had agreed with the FSA that it would process all on-hold and any new complaints from customers about PPI policies that they hold.
Barclays also announced that, as a goodwill gesture, it would pay out compensation to customers who had PPI complaints put on hold during the judicial review.
Barclays took a provision of 1bn in the second quarter of 2011 to cover the cost of future redress and administration.
As at 31 December 2011, following payments made during the year, the provision was 565m, and represents managements best estimate of the remaining anticipated costs of related customer redress, including administration expenses.
The provision requires significant judgement by management in determining appropriate assumptions.
The key assumptions include: Customer claims the volume and timing of actual customer claims.
The assumption is based upon recent experience of claims received and has factored in a component for the amount of duplicate or non-PPI eligible requests that have been submitted.
In addition, expectations in relation to claims management companies and other such activity have been considered.
Uphold rates the percentage of claims that are upheld as being valid upon review.
The rate considers recent experience and excludes gestures of goodwill paid without challenge by the Group for claims received during the Judicial Review period and not processed until the Review was completed.
A verage payment this is the expected average payment to customers for upheld claims.
The assumption is based upon recent experience and the calculation of payment requirements as dened by the agreements and the FSA Policy Paper.
com annualreport 247 29 Provisions continued There are a large number of inter-dependent assumptions under-pinning the PPI provision.
Many of those assumptions remain highly subjective, and trends have been difficult to ascertain across all portfolios.
Therefore, it is possible that the eventual outcome could differ from current management estimates, resulting in a material change to the amounts provided in the 2011 financial statements.
When considering the key assumptions independently, the most significant driver of the provision is complaint ow.
If the level of complaints were 10% higher lower than the estimated level for all policies, assuming no change in other assumptions, then the provision would have increased decreased by approximately 100m.
The Group will re-evaluate the assumptions underlying its analysis at each reporting date as more information becomes available.
30 Contingent liabilities and commitments Accounting for contingent liabilities and commitments Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured, are not recognised but are disclosed unless they are remote.
The following table summarises the nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities and commitments which are not recorded on balance sheet: 2011 2010 m m Securities lending arrangements 35,996 27,672 Guarantees and letters of credit pledged as collateral security 14,181 13,783 Performance guarantees, acceptances and endorsements 8,706 9,175 Contingent liabilities 58,883 50,630 Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions 1,358 1,194 Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments 240,282 222,963 In common with other banks, the Group conducts business involving acceptances, performance bonds and indemnities.
The majority of these facilities are offset by corresponding obligations of third parties.
Contingent liabilities Up to the disposal of Barclays Global Investors on 1 December 2009, the Group facilitated securities lending arrangements for its managed investment funds whereby securities held by funds under management were lent to third parties.
Borrowers provided cash or investment grade assets as collateral equal to 100% of the market value of the securities lent plus a margin of 2% -10%.
The Group agreed with BlackRock, Inc. to continue to provide indemnities to support these arrangements for three years following the disposal.
As at 31 December 2011 the fair value of collateral held was 37,072m 2010: 28,465m compared to the fair value of stock lent of 35,996m 2010: 27,672m.
Guarantees and letters of credit are given as security to support the performance of a customer to third parties.
In addition, the Group issues guarantees on its own behalf.
The main types of guarantees provided are: financial guarantees given to banks and financial institutions on behalf of customers to secure loans: overdrafts: and other banking facilities, including stock borrowing indemnities and standby letters of credit.
Other guarantees provided include performance guarantees, advance payment guarantees, tender guarantees, guarantees to Her Majestys Revenue and Customs and retention guarantees.
As the Group will only be required to meet these obligations in the event of the customers default, the cash requirements of these instruments are expected to be considerably below their nominal amounts.
Performance guarantees are generally, short-term commitments to third parties which are not directly dependent on the customers creditworthiness.
An acceptance is an undertaking by a bank to pay a bill of exchange drawn on a customer.
The Group expects most acceptances to be presented, but reimbursement by the customer is normally immediate.
Endorsements are residual liabilities of the Group in respect of bills of exchange, which have been paid and subsequently rediscounted.
Documentary credits and other short-term trade related transactions Documentary credits commit the Group to make payments to third parties, on production of documents, which are usually reimbursed immediately by customers.
Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments Standby facilities, credit lines and other commitments to lend are agreements to lend to a customer in the future, subject to certain conditions.
Such commitments are either made for a xed period, or have no specic maturity but are cancellable by the lender subject to notice requirements.
248 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 30 Contingent liabilities and commitments continued Barclays Capital US Mortgage Activities Barclays activities within the US residential mortgage sector during the period of 2005 through 2008 included: sponsoring and underwriting of approximately US$39bn of private-label securitisations: underwriting of approximately US$34bn of other private-label securitisations: sales of approximately US$150m of loans to government sponsored enterprises GSEs : and sales of approximately US$3bn of loans to others.
In addition, Barclays sold approximately US$4bn of loans to Protium in 2009.
As a result of Barclays acquisition of Protium in April 2011, Barclays reacquired the loans previously sold to Protium.
Some of the loans sold by Barclays were originated by a Barclays subsidiary.
Barclays also performed servicing activities through its US residential mortgage servicing business which Barclays acquired in Q4 2006 and subsequently sold in Q3 2010.
In connection with Barclays loan sales and some of its sponsored private-label securitisations, Barclays made certain loan level representations and warranties R&Ws generally relating to the underlying borrower, property and or mortgage documentation.
Under certain circumstances, Barclays may be required to repurchase the related loans or make other payments related to such loans if the R&Ws are breached.
As at 31 December 2011, Barclays R&Ws in respect of approximately US$1bn of loans sold to others which excludes the reacquired loans previously sold to Protium and loans sold to GSEs had expired.
The R&Ws with respect to the balance of the loans sold to others were not subject to expiration provisions.
However, such loans were generally sold at significant discounts and contained more limited R&Ws than loans sold to GSEs.
Third party originators provided loan level R&Ws directly to the securitisation trusts for approximately US$34bn of the US$39bn in Barclays sponsored securitisations.
Barclays or a subsidiary provided loan level R&Ws to the securitisation trusts for approximately US$5bn of the Barclays sponsored securitisations.
R&Ws made by Barclays in respect of such securitised loans, and the loans sold by Barclays to GSEs, are not subject to expiration provisions.
Total unresolved repurchase requests associated with all loans sold to others and private-label activities were US$21m at 31 December 2011.
Current provisions are adequate to cover estimated losses associated with outstanding repurchase claims.
However, based upon a large number of defaults occurring in US residential mortgages, there is a potential for additional claims for repurchases.
Claims against Barclays as an underwriter of RMBS offerings have been brought in certain civil actions see page 249.
Additionally, Barclays has received inquiries from various regulatory and governmental authorities regarding its mortgage-related activities and is cooperating with such inquiries.
It is not practicable to provide an estimate of the financial impact of the potential exposure in relation to Barclays Capital US Mortgage activities.
31 Legal Proceedings Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. On 15 September 2009, motions were led in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York the Court by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. LBHI, the SIPA Trustee for Lehman Brothers Inc. the Trustee and the Ofcial Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. the Committee.
All three motions challenged certain aspects of the transaction pursuant to which BCI and other companies in the Group acquired most of the assets of Lehman Brothers Inc. LBI in September 2008 and the court order approving such sale.
The claimants were seeking an order voiding the transfer of certain assets to BCI: requiring BCI to return to the LBI estate alleged excess value BCI received: and declaring that BCI is not entitled to certain assets that it claims pursuant to the sale documents and order approving the sale the Rule 60 Claims.
On 16 November 2009, LBHI, the Trustee and the Committee led separate complaints in the Court asserting claims against BCI based on the same underlying allegations as the pending motions and seeking relief similar to that which is requested in the motions.
On 29 January 2010, BCI led its response to the motions and also led a motion seeking delivery of certain assets that LBHI and LBI have failed to deliver as required by the sale documents and the court order approving the sale together with the Trustees competing claims to those assets, the Contract Claims.
Approximately US$4.2bn 2.7bn of the assets acquired as part of the acquisition had not been received by 31 December 2011, approximately US$3.0bn 2.0bn of which were recognised as part of the accounting for the acquisition and are included in the balance sheet as at 31 December 2011.
This results in an effective provision of US$1.2bn 0.8bn against the uncertainty inherent in the litigation.
On 22 February 2011, the Court issued its Opinion in relation to these matters, rejecting the Rule 60 Claims and deciding some of the Contract Claims in the Trustees favour and some in favour of BCI.
BCI and the Trustee have each led a notice of appeal from the Courts adverse rulings on the Contract Claims.
LBHI and the Committee have withdrawn their notices of appeal from the Courts ruling on the Rule 60 Claims, rendering the Courts Order on the Rule 60 Claims final.
If the final Orders relating to the Contract Claims were to be unaffected by future proceedings, Barclays estimates that after taking into account the effective provision of US$1.2bn 0.8bn, its loss would be approximately US$4.3bn 2.8bn.
Any such loss, however, is not considered probable and Barclays is satisfied with the current level of provision.
In addition, LBHI had been pursuing a claim for approximately US$500m relating to bonuses that BCI was allegedly obligated to pay to former Lehman employees.
On 14 September 2011, the Court issued a decision dismissing that claim and entered a final Order to that effect on 21 September 2011.
LBHI has stated that it will not appeal that decision, rendering the Order dismissing that claim final.
com annualreport 249 31 Legal Proceedings continued American Depositary Shares Barclays Bank PLC, Barclays PLC and various current and former members of Barclays PLCs Board of Directors have been named as defendants in five proposed securities class actions which have been consolidated pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York the Court.
The consolidated amended complaint, dated 12 February 2010, alleges that the registration statements relating to American Depositary Shares representing Preferred Stock, Series 2, 3, 4 and 5 the ADS offered by Barclays Bank PLC at various times between 2006 and 2008 contained misstatements and omissions concerning amongst other things Barclays portfolio of mortgage-related including US subprime-related securities, Barclays exposure to mortgage and credit market risk and Barclays financial condition.
The consolidated amended complaint asserts claims under Sections 11, 12 a 2 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933.
On 5 January 2011, the Court issued an order and, on 7 January 2011, judgment was entered, granting the defendants motion to dismiss the complaint in its entirety and closing the case.
On 4 February 2011, the plaintiffs led a motion asking the Court to reconsider in part its dismissal order.
On 31 May 2011, the Court denied in full the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration.
The plaintiffs have appealed both decisions the grant of the defendants motion to dismiss and the denial of the plaintiffs motion for reconsideration to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Barclays considers that these ADS-related claims against it are without merit and is defending them vigorously.
It is not practicable to estimate Barclays possible loss in relation to these claims or any effect that they might have upon operating results in any particular financial period.
US Federal Housing Finance Agency and Other Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Litigation The United States Federal Housing Finance Agency FHFA, acting for two US government sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collectively, the GSEs, led lawsuits against 17 financial institutions in connection with the GSEs purchases of residential mortgage-backed securities RMBS.
The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the RMBS offering materials contained materially false and misleading statements and or omissions.
Barclays Bank PLC and or certain of its afliates or former employees are named in two of these lawsuits, relating to sales between 2005 and 2007 of RMBS, in which Barclays Capital Inc. was lead or co-lead underwriter.
Both complaints demand, among other things: rescission and recovery of the consideration paid for the RMBS: and recovery for the GSEs alleged monetary losses arising out of their ownership of the RMBS.
The complaints are similar to other civil actions led against Barclays Bank PLC and or certain of its afliates by other plaintiffs, including the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle, Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston, Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago, Cambridge Place Investment Management, Inc. HSH Nordbank AG and afliates and Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, relating to their purchases of RMBS.
Barclays considers that the claims against it are without merit and intends to defend them vigorously.
The original amount of RMBS related to the claims against Barclays in these cases totaled approximately US$6.8bn, of which approximately US$2.0bn was outstanding as at 31 December 2011.
Cumulative losses reported on these RMBS as at 31 December 2011 were approximately US$0.1bn.
If Barclays were to lose these cases it could incur a loss of up to the outstanding amount of the RMBS at the time of judgment taking into account further principal payments after 31 December 2011 plus any cumulative losses on the RMBS at such time and any interest, fees and costs, less the market value of the RMBS at such time.
Barclays has estimated the total market value of the RMBS as at 31 December 2011 to be approximately US$1.1bn.
Barclays may be entitled to indemnification for a portion of any losses.
Devonshire Trust On 13 January 2009, Barclays commenced an action in the Ontario Superior Court seeking an order that its early terminations earlier that day of two credit default swaps under an ISDA Master Agreement with the Devonshire Trust Devonshire, an asset-backed commercial paper conduit trust, were valid.
On the same day, Devonshire purported to terminate the swaps on the ground that Barclays had failed to provide liquidity support to Devonshires commercial paper when required to do so.
On 7 September 2011, the court ruled that Barclays early terminations were invalid, Devonshires early terminations were valid and, consequently, Devonshire was entitled to receive back from Barclays cash collateral of approximately C$533m together with accrued interest thereon.
Barclays is appealing the courts decision.
If the courts decision were to be unaffected by future proceedings, Barclays estimates that its loss would be approximately C$500m, less any impairment provisions taken by Barclays for this matter.
Other Barclays is engaged in various other legal proceedings both in the United Kingdom and a number of overseas jurisdictions, including the United States, involving claims by and against it which arise in the ordinary course of business, including debt collection, consumer claims and contractual disputes.
Barclays does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these proceedings to which Barclays is party to have a material adverse effect on its results of operations, cash ows or the financial position of the Group and Barclays has not disclosed the contingent liabilities associated with these claims either because they cannot reliably be estimated or because such disclosure could be prejudicial to the conduct of the claims.
Provisions have been recognised for those cases where Barclays is able reliably to estimate the probable loss where the probable loss is not fide minimis.
In addition, the Bank has been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits, including class actions, led in US federal courts involving claims by purported classes of purchasers and sellers of LIBOR-based derivative products or Eurodollar futures or option contracts between 2006 and 2009: further details are provided on the following page.
250 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 32 Competition and regulatory matters This note highlights some of the key competition and regulatory challenges facing Barclays, many of which are beyond our control.
The extent of the impact of these matters on Barclays cannot always be predicted but may materially impact our businesses and earnings.
Regulatory change The scale of regulatory change remains challenging with a significant tightening of regulation and changes to regulatory structures globally, especially for banks that are deemed to be of systemic importance.
Concurrently, there is continuing political and regulatory scrutiny of the operation of the banking and consumer credit industries which, in some cases, is leading to increased or changing regulation which is likely to have a significant effect on the industry.
Examples include Basel 3, the emerging proposals on bank resolution regimes and proposals relating to over-the-counter derivatives clearing and global systemically important banks.
In the UK, the FSAs current responsibilities are to be reallocated between the Prudential Regulatory Authority a subsidiary of the Bank of England and a new Financial Conduct Authority.
In addition, the Independent Commission on Banking the ICB completed its review of the UK banking system and published its final report on 12 September 2011.
The ICB recommended amongst other things that: i the UK and EEA retail banking activities of a UK bank or building society should be placed in a legally distinct, operationally separate and economically independent entity so-called ring-fencing : and ii the loss-absorbing capacity of ring-fenced banks and UK-headquartered global systemically important banks such as Barclays Bank PLC should be increased to levels higher than the Basel 3 proposals.
The UK Government published its response to the ICB recommendations in December 2011 and indicated that primary and secondary legislation relating to the proposed ring-fence will be completed by May 2015, with UK banks and building societies expected to be compliant as soon as practicable thereafter, and the requirements relating to increased loss-absorbing capacity of ringfenced banks and UK-headquartered global systemically important banks will be applicable from 1 January 2019.
The US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains far reaching regulatory reform.
The full impact on Barclays businesses and markets will not be known until the principal implementing rules are adopted in final form by governmental authorities, a process which is underway and which will take effect over several years.
Payment Protection Insurance PPI See Note 29.
Interchange The Ofce of Fair Trading, as well as other competition authorities elsewhere in Europe, continues to investigate Visa and MasterCard credit and debit interchange rates.
These investigations may have an impact on the consumer credit industry as well as having the potential for the imposition of fines.
Timing is uncertain but outcomes may be known within the next 2-4 years.
London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR The FSA, the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC, the US Department of Justice Fraud Section of the Criminal Division and Antitrust Division and the European Commission are amongst various authorities conducting investigations into submissions made by Barclays and other panel members to the bodies that set various interbank offered rates.
Barclays is co-operating in the relevant investigations and is keeping regulators informed.
In addition, Barclays has been named as a defendant in a number of class action lawsuits led in US federal courts involving claims by purported classes of purchasers and sellers of LIBOR-based derivative products or Eurodollar futures or options contracts between 2006 and 2009.
The complaints are substantially similar and allege, amongst other things, that Barclays and other banks individually and collectively violated US antitrust and commodities laws and state common law by suppressing LIBOR rates during the relevant period.
Barclays has been informed by certain of the authorities investigating these matters that proceedings against Barclays may be recommended with respect to some aspects of the matters under investigation, and Barclays is engaged in discussions with those authorities about potential resolution of those aspects.
It is not currently possible to predict the ultimate resolution of the issues covered by the various investigations and lawsuits, including the timing and the scale of the potential impact on the Group of any resolution.

Interest All undated loan capital bears a xed rate of interest until the initial call date, with the exception of the 9% Bonds which are xed for the life of the issue, and the Junior and Series 3 Undated Notes which are oating rate.
After the initial call date, in the event that they are not redeemed, the 6.875%, 6.375%, 7.125%, 6.125% Undated Notes, the 9.25% Bonds and the 6.140% Perpetual Notes will bear interest at rates xed periodically in advance for five year periods based on market rates.

Payment of interest Barclays Bank PLC is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its Undated Notes, Bonds and Loans excluding the 7.7% Undated Notes, 8.25% Undated Notes, 9.25% Bonds and 6.140% Perpetual Notes if, in the preceding six months, a dividend has not been declared or paid on any class of shares of Barclays PLC or, in certain cases, any class of preference shares of the Bank.
The Bank is not obliged to make a payment of interest on its 9.25% Perpetual Subordinated Bonds if, in the immediately preceding 12-months interest period, a dividend has not been paid on any class of its share capital.
Interest not so paid becomes payable in each case if such a dividend is subsequently paid or in certain other circumstances.
During the year, the Bank declared and paid dividends on its ordinary shares and on all classes of preference shares.
No payment of principal or any interest may be made unless the Bank satisfies a specified solvency test.
The Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the 7.7% Undated Notes and 8.25% Undated Notes.
Until such time as any deferred interest has been paid in full, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of its ordinary shares, preference shares, or other share capital or satisfy any payments of interest or coupons on certain other junior obligations.
The Issuer and the Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the 6.140% Perpetual Notes.
However, any deferred interest will automatically become immediately due and payable on the earlier of: i the date on which any dividend or other distribution or interest or other payment is made in respect of any pari passu or any junior obligations or on which any pari passu or any junior obligations are purchased, ii the date of redemption or purchase of the 6.140% Perpetual Notes and iii certain other events including bankruptcy, liquidation or winding up of the Issuer or the Bank.

Whilst such deferral is continuing, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of its ordinary shares or preference shares.
The Bank may elect to defer any payment of interest on the TONs if it determines that it is, or such payment would result in it being, in non-compliance with capital adequacy requirements and policies of the FSA.
Any such deferred payment of interest will only be payable on a redemption of the TONs.
Until such time as the Bank next makes a payment of interest on the TONs, neither the Bank nor Barclays PLC may i declare or pay a dividend, subject to certain exceptions, on any of their respective ordinary shares or Preference Shares, or make payments of interest in respect of the Banks Reserve Capital Instruments and ii certain restrictions on the redemption, purchase or reduction of their respective share capital and certain other securities also apply.

Any repayments prior to maturity require, in the case of the Bank, the prior notication to the FSA, or in the case of the overseas issues, the approval of the local regulator for that jurisdiction.
There are no committed facilities in existence at the balance sheet date which permit the renancing of debt beyond the date of maturity.

com annualreport 255 35 Reserves Currency translation reserve The currency translation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on the retranslation of the Groups net investment in foreign operations, net of the effects of hedging.
Currency translation movements in 2011 of 1,607m 2010: 1,184m, including 598m 2010: 442m associated with non-controlling interests, are largely due to the depreciation of the Rand, Euro and Indian Rupee against Sterling.
The impact of the currency translation reserve recognised in the income statement during the year was nil 2010: 279m, as the 23m loss from the disposal of Barclays Bank Russia was offset by other movements.
Available for sale reserve The available for sale reserve represents the unrealised change in the fair value of available for sale investments since initial recognition.
The reserve increased 1,380m 2010: decreased 1,245m, largely driven by 2,748m gains from changes in fair value, offset by 1,557m of net gains transferred to the income statement after recognition of impairment on the Groups investment in BlackRock, Inc. Cash ow hedge reserve The cash ow hedge reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on effective cash ow hedging instruments that will be recycled to the income statement when hedged transactions affect profit or loss.
Movements in the cash ow hedge reserve principally reected increases in the fair value of interest rate swaps held for hedging purposes, partially offset by related gains transferred to net profit.
Other reserves and treasury shares Other reserves represent the excess of the repurchase price over the nominal of redeemed ordinary and preference shares issues by the Group.
Treasury shares are deducted from shareholders equity within other reserves and treasury shares.
A transfer is made to retained earnings in line with the vesting of treasury shares held for the purposes of share based payments.
The treasury shares primarily relate to Barclays PLC shares held by employee benefit trusts in relation to the Groups various share schemes.
These schemes are described in Note 38.

The reduction in Reserve Capital Instruments as at 31 December 2011 to nil 2010: 1,418m is due to the buy back, at the Groups option, of instruments with a nominal value of $1.25bn and $0.75bn during June and December 2011 respectively.

com annualreport 257 Employee benets Employee benets outlines the costs and commitments associated with employing our staff.
37 Staff costs Accounting for staff costs The Group applies IAS 19 Employee benets in its accounting for most of the components of staff costs.
Short-term employee benets salaries, accrued performance costs, social security and the Bonus Payroll Tax are recognised over the period in which the employees provide the services to which the payments relate.
Performance costs recognised to the extent that the Group has a present obligation to its employees that can be measured reliably and are recognised over the period of service that employees are required to work to qualify for the services.
Deferred cash bonus awards and deferred share bonus awards are made to employees to incentivise performance over the vesting period.
To receive payment under an award, employees must provide service over the vesting period, typically three years from the grant date.
The period over which the expense for deferred cash and share bonus awards is recognised is based upon the common understanding between the employee and the Group and the terms and conditions of the award.
The Group considers that it is appropriate to recognise the awards over the period from the date of grant to the date that the awards vest as this is the period over which the employees understand that they must provide service in order to receive awards.
The table on page 64 details the relevant award dates, payment dates and the period in which the income statement charge arises for bonuses.
No expense has been recognised in 2011 for the deferred bonuses granted in March 2012, as they are dependent upon future performance rather than performance during 2011.
The accounting policies for share based payments and pensions and other post retirement benets are under Note 38 and Note 39 respectively.

com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 38 Share based payments Accounting for share based payments The Group applies IFRS 2 Share Based Payments in accounting for employee remuneration in the form of shares.
Employee incentives include awards in the form of shares and share options, as well as offering employees the opportunity to purchase shares on favourable terms.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in the income statement over the period that employees provide services, generally the period in which the award is granted or notied and the vesting date of the shares or options.
The overall cost of the award is calculated using the number of shares and options expected to vest and the fair value of the shares or options at the date of grant.
The number of shares and options expected to vest takes into account the likelihood that performance and service conditions included in the terms of the awards will be met.
Failure to meet the non-vesting condition is treated as a cancellation, resulting in an acceleration of recognition of the cost of the employee services.
The fair value of shares is the market price ruling on the grant date, in some cases adjusted to reect restrictions on transferability.
The fair value of options granted is determined using option pricing models to estimate the numbers of shares likely to vest.
These take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the share price over the life of the option and other relevant factors.
Market conditions that must be met in order for the award to vest are also reected in the fair value of the award, as are any other non-vesting conditions such as continuing to make payments into a share based savings scheme.
The charge for the year arising from share based payment schemes was as follows: Charge for the year 2011 2010 2009 m m m Share Value Plan 634 361 Executive Share Award Scheme 101 304 178 Others 137 172 100 Total equity settled 872 837 278 Cash settled 34 23 8 Total continuing operations 906 860 286 Discontinued operations 12 Total share based payments 906 860 298 The terms of the main current plans are as follows: Share value plan SVP The SVP was introduced in March 2010 and approved by shareholders for Executive Director participation and use of new issue shares at the AGM in April 2011.
SVP awards are granted to participants in the form of a conditional right to receive Barclays shares awards granted prior to May 2011 were granted as provisional allocations of Barclays shares which vest over a period of three years in equal annual tranches.
Participants do not pay to receive an award or to receive a release of shares.
The grantor may also make a dividend equivalent payment to participants on vesting of a SVP award.
SVP awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under schedule 1 to the SVP.
From 2010, the portion of a business unit LTIP award that was previously granted under ESAS is normally granted under SVP.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture in certain leaver scenarios.
Executive Share Award Scheme ESAS For certain employees of the Group an element of their annual bonus is in the form of a deferred award of a provisional allocation of Barclays PLC shares under ESAS.
The total value of the bonus made to the employee, of which ESAS is an element, is dependent upon the business unit, Group and individual employee performance.
The ESAS element of the annual bonus must normally be held for at least three years.
Additional bonus shares are subsequently awarded to recipients of the provisional allocation and vest upon achieving continued service for three and five years from the date of award.
ESAS awards are also made to eligible employees for recruitment purposes under JSAP Joiners Share Award Plan.
All awards are subject to potential forfeiture if the individual resigns and commences work with a competitor business.
LTIP plans are cash and equity performance plans which after 3 years dependant on performance pay half in cash and the remaining half in shares which are placed into ESAS for a further 1 or 2 years.
Other schemes In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a number of other schemes including schemes operated by and settled in the shares of subsidiary undertakings, none of which are individually or in aggregate material in relation to the charge for the year or the dilutive effect of outstanding share options.
Included within other schemes are the Performance Share Plan, Incentive Share Plan, Sharesave, Sharepurchase, and the Barclays Long Term Incentive Plan which was introduced and approved at the AGM in April 2011.

Consequently the fair value of these awards options is based on the market value at that date.
As described above, the terms of the ESAS scheme require shares to be held for a set number of years from the date of vesting.
The calculation of the vesting date fair value of such awards includes a reduction for this post-vesting restriction.
This discount is determined by calculating how much a willing market participant would rationally pay to remove the restriction using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The total discount required in 2011 is nil 2010: 22m, 2009: 10m.

Treasury Shares The Group, through various employee benefit trusts, holds shares in Barclays PLC treasury shares to meet its obligations under its share based payment schemes.
The total number of Barclays shares held in Group employee benefit trusts at 31 December 2011 was 3.9 million 2010: 259.0 million.
The reduction is due to a change in the funding approach by the trustee, whereby holdings of treasury shares have been replaced with instruments that hedge the economic exposure to movements in the Barclays share price.

com annualreport 261 39 Pensions and post retirement benets Accounting for pensions and post retirement benets The Group operates a number of pension schemes including dened contribution, dened benefit and post-employment benefit schemes.
Dened contribution schemes the Group recognises contributions due in respect of the accounting period in the income statement.
Any contributions unpaid at the balance sheet date are included as a liability.
Dened benefit schemes the Group recognises its obligation to members of the scheme at the period end, less the fair value of the scheme assets and unrecognised actuarial gains or losses.
Each schemes obligations are calculated using the projected unit credit method on the assumptions set out in the note below.
Scheme assets are stated at fair value as at the period end.
The Group uses the option within IAS 19 Employee Benets to defer actuarial gains and losses over the remaining service lives of the employees.
Actuarial gains and losses comprise experience adjustments differences between previous actuarial assumptions and what has actually occurred and the effects of changes in actuarial assumptions.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses, to the extent that they exceed the greater of: 10% of the fair value of the scheme assets or 10% of the present value of the dened benefit obligation, are deferred and the excess amortised in the income statement over the average service lives of scheme members.
Gains and losses on curtailments are recognised when the curtailment occurs, which may be when a demonstrable commitment to a reduction in benets, or reduction in eligible employees, occurs.
The gain or loss comprises any change in the present value of the obligation, the fair value of the assets and any related unrecognised actuarial gain or loss and past service costs.
Where a schemes assets and its unrecognised actuarial losses exceed its obligation, an asset is recognised to the extent that it does not exceed the present value of future contribution holidays or refunds of contributions.
Post-employment benets the cost of providing health care benets to retired employees is accrued as a liability in the financial statements over the period that the employees provide services to the Group, using a methodology similar to that for dened benefit pension schemes.
Future accounting development From 1 January 2013, in accordance with amendments to IAS 19, the Group balance sheet will fully reect the pension liability or asset, including any unrecognised actuarial losses or gains.
As at 31 December 2011 there were unrecognised actuarial losses of 1.7bn.
In addition, the Group will recognise interest charge or income on the net pension liability or asset, rather than the expected return on the schemes assets and interest cost on the schemes benefit obligation.
The Group will no longer recognise the amortisation of unrecognised actuarial gains or losses which in 2011 gave rise to a charge of 0.1bn.
Given these amendments the charge for 2011 would have been 0.1bn higher under the amended standard, and a charge of 1.7bn would have been recognised in other comprehensive income.
Pension schemes The UK Retirement Fund UKRF is the Groups main scheme, representing 92% of the Groups total retirement benefit obligations.
The UKRF comprises ten sections, the most significant of which are: Afterwork: comprising of a voluntary dened contribution element and a contributory cash balance dened benefit.
The cash balance element is revalued until Normal Retirement Age in line with the increase in Retail Price Index RPI maximum 5%.
An investment related increase of up to 2% a year may also be added at Barclays discretion.
Since 1 October 2003 the majority of new employees outside of Barclays Capital have been eligible to join.
The Pension Investment Plan PIP : a dened contribution section providing benets for Barclays Capital employees from 1 July 2001.
The 1964 Pension Scheme: most employees recruited before July 1997 built up benets in this non-contributory dened benefit scheme in respect of service up to 31 March 2010.
Pensions were calculated by reference to service and pensionable salary.
From 1 April 2010 members became eligible to accrue future service benets in either Afterwork or PIP.
The costs of ill-health retirements and death in service benets are borne by the UKRF.
Governance The UKRF operates under trust law and is managed and administered on behalf of the members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and Rules and all relevant legislation.
The Corporate Trustee is Barclays Pension Funds Trustees Limited, a private limited company incorporated on 20 December 1990 and a wholly owned subsidiary of Barclays Bank PLC.
The Trustee is the legal owner of the assets of the UKRF which are held separately from the assets of the Group.
The Trustee Board comprises six Management Directors selected by Barclays, of whom three are independent Directors with no relationship with Barclays or the UKRF, plus three Member Nominated Directors selected from eligible active staff and pensioner members who apply for the role.
The same principles of pension governance apply to the Groups other pension schemes, although different legislation covers overseas schemes where, in most cases, the Group has the power to determine the funding rate.

com annualreport 263 39 Pensions and post retirement benets continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements Actuarial valuation of the schemes obligation is dependent upon a series of assumptions.
Below is a summary of the main financial and demographic assumptions adopted for UKRF: UKRF financial assumptions 2011 2010 % p. a.
Discount rate 4.74 5.31 Rate of increase in salaries 3.54 4.00 Ination rate 3.04 3.50 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.94 3.35 Rate of increase for pensions in deferment 2.94 3.50 a Afterwork revaluation rate 3.47 3.97 Expected return on scheme assets 5.00 6.30 The UKRF discount rate assumption is based on a liability-weighted rate derived from an AA corporate bond yield curve and the ination assumption reects long-term expectations of RPI.
The UKRFs post-retirement mortality assumptions are based on a best estimate assumption derived from an analysis in 2011 of Barclays own post-retirement mortality experience which was carried out at the time of the latest triennial funding valuation, and taking account of the recent evidence from published mortality surveys.
An allowance has been made for future mortality improvements based on the medium cohort projections published by the Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau subject to a oor of 1% p. a. on future improvements.
The table below shows how the assumed life expectancy at 60, for members of the UKRF, has varied over the last five years: Assumed life expectancy 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 Life expectancy at 60 for current pensioners years Males 27.7 27.6 27.5 27.4 26.7 Females 28.8 28.7 28.7 28.5 27.9 Life expectancy at 60 for future pensioners currently aged 40 years Males 29.1 29.7 29.6 29.5 28.0 Females 30.4 30.7 30.6 30.5 29.1 Sensitivity analysis on actuarial assumptions The following table shows a sensitivity analysis of the most material assumptions on the UKRF benefit obligation: Impact on UKRF benefit Change in key assumptions obligation Decrease Decrease Increase Increase % bn 0.5% increase in: Discount rate 8.7 1.8 Rate of ination 9.1 1.9 1 year increase to life expectancy at 60 2.5 0.5 Note a This is the assumption applied to the Afterwork cash balance element.
264 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 39 Pensions and post retirement benets continued Assets A long term strategy has been set for the asset allocation of the UKRF which comprises a mixture of equities, bonds, property and other appropriate assets.
This recognises that different asset classes are likely to produce different long term returns and some asset classes may be more volatile than others.
The long term strategy ensures that investments are adequately diversied.
Asset managers are permitted some exibility to vary the asset allocation from the long term strategy within control ranges agreed with the Trustee from time to time.
The UKRF also employs derivative instruments, where appropriate, to achieve a desired exposure or return, or to match assets more closely to liabilities.
The value of assets shown reects the actual physical assets held by the scheme, with any derivative holdings reected on a mark to market basis.
The value of the assets of the schemes, their percentage in relation to total scheme assets, and their expected rate of return were as follows: Analysis of scheme assets Total Of which relates to UKRF % of total % of total fair value Expected fair value Expected of scheme rate of of scheme rate of Value assets return Value assets return m % % m % % As at 31 December 2011 Equities 4,979 21.9 7.8 4,452 20.7 7.7 Bonds 11,246 49.4 3.8 10,872 50.5 3.7 Property 1,389 6.1 6.2 1,356 6.3 6.1 Derivatives 1,296 5.7 1,296 6.0 Cash 3,253 14.3 0.6 3,167 14.7 0.5 Other 585 2.6 4.4 397 1.8 2.5 Fair value of scheme assets 22,748 100 5.1 21,540 100 5.0 As at 31 December 2010 Equities 5,865 31.0 8.3 5,349 30.4 8.4 Bonds 9,641 51.0 4.7 9,164 52.0 4.6 Property 1,297 6.9 6.9 1,277 7.2 6.8 Derivatives 410 2.2 410 2.3 Cash 1,215 6.4 1.2 1,057 6.0 0.5 Other 477 2.5 5.6 364 2.1 4.3 Fair value of scheme assets 18,905 100 6.3 17,621 100 6.3 Included within fair value of scheme assets were: 15m 2010: 14m relating to shares in Barclays Group, 12m 2010: 13m relating to bonds issued by the Barclays Group, and 12m 2010: 10m relating to property occupied by Group companies.
The UKRF also invests in pooled investment vehicles which may hold shares or debt issued by the Barclays Group.
The UKRF scheme assets also includes 50m 2010: 58m relating to UK private equity investments and 1,342m 2010: 1,128m relating to overseas private equity investments.
These are disclosed above within Equities.
The expected return on assets is determined by calculating a total return estimate based on weighted average estimated returns for each asset class.
Asset class returns are estimated using current and projected economic and market factors such as ination, credit spreads and equity risk premiums.
The Group actual return on scheme assets was an increase of 2,595m 2010: 2,134m increase.
The overall expected return on assets assumption has recognised that some of the cash holding at 31 December 2011 was due to be reinvested shortly after year end in line with the long term strategy.
The overall expected return on asset assumption has also been based on the portfolio of assets created after allowing for the net impact of the derivatives on the risk and return prole of the holdings.

In compliance with the Pensions Act 2004, the Bank and Trustee agreed a scheme-specic funding target, statement of funding principles, a schedule of contributions and a recovery plan to eliminate the deficit in the Fund.
The recovery plan to eliminate the deficit will result in the Bank paying deficit contributions to the Fund until 2021. deficit contributions of 1.8bn were paid to the fund in December 2011 and a further 0.5bn will be paid in 2012.
Further deficit contributions are payable from 2017 to 2021 starting at 0.65bn in 2017 and increasing by approximately 3.5% per annum until 2021.
These deficit contributions are in addition to the regular contributions to meet the Groups share of the cost of benets accruing over each year.
Including deficit contributions, the Groups estimated contribution to the UKRF in 2012 will be 877m.
Excluding the UKRF, the Group is expected to pay contributions of approximately 1m to UK schemes and 94m to overseas schemes in 2012.
The Scheme Actuary prepares an annual update of the funding position as at 30 September.
The latest annual update was carried out as at 30 September 2011 and showed a deficit of 6.4bn.

This resulted in the general partner interest being acquired by Barclays for a nominal consideration and the remaining interest in Protium held by Protiums investment manager, redeemed for consideration of 50m in accordance with the performance fees that would have been due under the original agreement, based on investment performance to date.
Barclays become the sole owner and controlling party of Protium, which is consolidated by the Group.
There was no gain or loss and no goodwill arising as the impairment on the loan was already calculated by reference to Protiums net asset value of 5,856m.
As part of this transaction, US$750m of proceeds from a partial redemption of the loan to Protium was invested into Helix, an existing fund managed by Protiums investment manager.
This represents a majority interest in the fund, which has also been consolidated by the Group.
The pre-acquisition carrying amounts of the acquired assets and liabilities, stated in accordance with the Groups accounting policies, were equal to their fair value on acquisition as set out below.
There was no gain and no loss arising on the transaction.
Fair values m Assets Trading portfolio assets 4,731 Financial assets designated at fair value 1,004 Derivative financial instruments 5 Loans and advances to banks 472 Reverse repurchase agreements 29 Other assets 46 Total assets 6,287 Liabilities Deposits from banks 1 Trading portfolio liabilities 93 Financial liabilities designated at fair value 76 Derivative financial instruments 23 Repurchase agreements 24 Other liabilities 51 Total liabilities 268 Net assets acquired Group share 100% 6,019 Considerations cash 163 loan 5,856 Total consideration 6,019 The Groups exposure to Protium prior to acquisition represented a loan.
Subsequent to acquisition the underlying assets held by Protium were consolidated by the Group and have been integrated into the corresponding business lines.
The contribution of Protium and related underlying assets on the Groups profit before tax for the year of 55m reected a 223m impairment release and 36m interest income on the loan prior to acquisition, offset by 204m post acquisition fair value reductions in the underlying assets offsets by gains arising on the unwind of structured assets.
Post acquisition losses comprised 27m gain on US sub prime and Alt-A, 249m losses on commercial mortgage backed securities, 92m gains on CDO and other assets, 56m of net interest and other income, 74m of funding charges and 56m of fees to Protiums investment manager.
The 50m consideration paid by Protium to redeem the remaining interest held by its investment manager represents the settlement of an existing liability.
As pre-acquisition impairment was calculated by reference to Protiums net asset value, this amount was reected in the impairment charge and did not give rise to a loss on acquisition.
At the acquisition date, the contractual amounts due to maturity on the acquired assets were 28bn.
These assets are predominantly held for trading purposes so are not expected to be held to maturity.
Acquisition related costs of nil have been included in operating expenses.
The aggregate net outow of cash from acquisition during the year was 163m.
During the year, Barclays acquired 2.1bn gross consumer credit card assets from Egg UK, a 130m corporate card portfolio from MBNA Europe Bank Limited and a $1.4bn Upromise by Sallie Mae credit card portfolio from FIA Card Services, N. A. part of Bank of America.
These acquisitions were asset purchases and therefore, have not been included in the table above.
In addition Barclays acquired the Baubecon portfolio of German residential properties following a debt restructuring transaction for 0.8bn.
The properties have a current fair value of 1bn and are accounted for as investment properties.
268 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 42 Investments in associates and joint ventures Accounting for associates and joint ventures Barclays applies IAS 28 Investments in Associates and IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
Associates are entities in which the Group has significant inuence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
Generally the Group holds more than 20%, but less than 50%, of their voting shares.
Joint Ventures are entities whose activities are governed by a contractual arrangement between the Group and one or more parties to share equally in decisions regarding operating and financial policies.
The Groups investments in associates and joint ventures are initially recorded at cost and increased or decreased each year by the Groups share of the post acquisition profit or loss.
In some cases, investments in these entities may be held at fair value through profit or loss, for example, those held by private equity businesses.
2011 2010 m m Investment in associates 169 261 Investment in joint ventures 258 257 Total 427 518 Summarised financial information for the Groups associates and joint ventures is set out below.
The amounts shown are assets, liabilities and net income of the investees, not just the Groups share, as at and for the year ended 31 December 2011 with the exception of certain undertakings for which the amounts are based on accounts made up to dates not earlier than three months before the balance sheet date.

43 Securitisations Accounting for securitisations The Group uses securitisations as a source of finance and a means of risk transfer.
Such transactions generally result in the transfer of contractual cash ows from portfolios of financial assets to holders of issued debt securities.
Securitisations may, depending on the individual arrangement, result in continued recognition of the securitised assets and the recognition of the debt securities issued in the transaction: lead to partial continued recognition of the assets to the extent of the Groups continuing involvement in those assets or to derecognition of the assets and the separate recognition, as assets or liabilities, of any rights and obligations created or retained in the transfer.
Full derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers both its contractual right to receive cash ows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash ows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash ows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
The Group is party to securitisation transactions for funding purposes, involving its residential mortgage loans, business loans and credit card balances.
In addition, the Group acts as a conduit for commercial paper, whereby it acquires static pools of residential mortgage loans from other lending institutions for securitisation transactions.
In these transactions, the assets, or interests in the assets, or beneficial interests in the cash ows arising from the assets, are transferred to a special purpose entity, or to a trust which then transfers its beneficial interests to a special purpose entity, which then issues oating rate debt securities to third-party investors.
com annualreport 269 43 Securitisations continued The following table shows the carrying amount of securitised assets, stated at the amount of the Groups continuing involvement where appropriate, together with the associated liabilities, for each category of asset on the balance sheet: 2011 2010 Carrying Carrying amount of Associated amount of Associated assets liabilities assets liabilities m m m m Loans and advances to customers Residential mortgage loans 7,946 8,085 9,709 10,674 Credit card receivables 4,059 3,477 801 723 Wholesale and corporate loans and advances 1,391 1,428 2,560 2,878 Total 13,396 12,990 13,070 14,275 Assets designated at fair value through profit or loss Retained interest in residential mortgage loans 1 5 Balances included within loans and advances to customers represent securitisations where substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset have been retained by the Group.
As a result these securitisations represents secured nancing, although for regulatory capital purposes they may give rise to a regulatory capital benefit due to risk sharing with investors.
The excess of total associated liabilities over the carrying amount of assets primarily reects timing differences in the receipt and payment of cash ows, and foreign exchange movements where the assets and associated liabilities are denominated in different currencies.
Foreign exchange movements and associated risks are hedged economically through the use of cross currency swap derivative contracts.
Retained interests in residential mortgage loans are securities which represent a continuing exposure to the prepayment and credit risk in the underlying securitised assets.
The total amount of the loans was 2,299m 2010: 15,458m.
The retained interest is initially recorded as an allocation of the original carrying amount based on the relative fair values of the portion derecognised and the portion retained.
44 Off-balance sheet arrangements In the ordinary course of business and primarily to facilitate client transactions, the Group enters into transactions which may involve the use of off-balance sheet arrangements and special purpose entities SPEs.
These arrangements include the provision of guarantees, loan commitments, retained interests in assets which have been transferred to an unconsolidated SPE or obligations arising from the Groups involvements with such SPEs.
Guarantees The Group issues guarantees on behalf of its customers.
In the majority of cases, the Group will hold collateral against the exposure, have a right of recourse to the customer or both.
The nominal principal amount of contingent liabilities with off-balance sheet risk is set out in Note 30.
Loan commitments The Group enters into commitments to lend to its customers subject to certain conditions.
Such loan commitments are made either for a xed period or are cancellable by the Group subject to notice conditions.
Information on loan commitments and similar facilities is set out in Note 30.
Leasing The Group leases various ofces, branches, other premises and equipment under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements.
Information on leasing can be found in Note 27.
SPEs SPEs are entities that are created to accomplish a narrow and well dened objective.
There are often specic restrictions or limits around their ongoing activities.
The Groups transactions with SPEs take a number of forms, including: the provision of nancing to fund asset purchases, or commitments to provide finance for future purchases: derivative transactions to provide investors in the SPE with a specified exposure: the provision of liquidity or backstop facilities which may be drawn upon if the SPE experiences future funding difficulties: and direct investment in the notes issued by SPEs.
270 Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.
com annualreport Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 44 Off-balance sheet arrangements continued A number of the Groups transactions have recourse only to the assets of unconsolidated SPEs.
Typically, the majority of the exposure to these assets is borne by third parties and the Groups risk is mitigated through , unwind features and other protective measures.
The business activities within the Group where SPEs are used include multi-seller conduit programmes, asset securitisations, client intermediation, credit structuring, asset realisations and fund management.
These activities are described below.
In addition, later sections provide quantitative information on the Groups involvements with CDOs, SIVs, SIV-Lites and conduits.
Multi-seller conduit programmes Barclays creates, administers and provides liquidity and credit enhancements to several commercial paper conduit programmes, primarily in the United States.
These conduits provide clients access to liquidity in the commercial paper markets by allowing them to sell consumer or trade receivables to the conduit, which then issues commercial paper to investors to fund the purchase.
The conduits have sufficient collateral, credit enhancements and liquidity support to maintain an investment grade rating for the commercial paper.
Asset securitisations The Group has assisted its customers with the formation of asset securitisations, some of which are effected through the use of SPEs.
These entities have minimal equity and rely on funding in the form of notes to purchase the assets for securitisation.
As these SPEs are created for other companies, the Group does not usually control these entities and therefore does not consolidate them.
The Group may provide nancing in the form of senior notes or junior notes and may also provide derivatives to the SPE.
These transactions are included on the balance sheet.
The Group has also used SPEs to securitise part of its originated and purchased retail and commercial lending portfolios and credit card receivables.
These SPEs are usually consolidated and derecognition only occurs when the Group transfers its contractual right to receive cash ows from the financial assets, or retains the contractual rights to receive the cash ows, but assumes a contractual obligation to pay the cash ows to another party without material delay or reinvestment, and also transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership, including credit risk, prepayment risk and interest rate risk.
The carrying amount of securitised assets together with the associated liabilities are set out in Note 43.
Client intermediation The Group has structured transactions as a financial intermediary to meet investor and client needs.
These transactions involve entities structured by either the Group or the client and are used to modify cash ows of third party assets to create investments with specic risk or return proles or to assist clients in the efficient management of other risks.
Such transactions will typically result in a derivative being shown on the balance sheet, representing the Groups exposure to the relevant asset.
The Group also invests in lessor entities specically to acquire assets for leasing.
Client intermediation also includes arrangements to fund the purchase or construction of specic assets most common in the property industry.
Credit structuring The Group structures investments to provide specic risk proles to investors.
This may involve the sale of credit exposures, often by way of derivatives, to an entity which subsequently funds those exposures by issuing securities.
These securities may initially be held by Barclays prior to sale outside of the Group.
Asset realisations The Group establishes SPEs to facilitate the recovery of loans in circumstances where the borrower has suffered financial loss.
To the extent that there are guarantees and commitments in relation to SPEs the details are included in Note 30.
Collateralised debt obligations CDOs The Group has structured and underwritten CDOs.
At inception, the Groups exposure principally takes the form of a liquidity facility provided to support future funding difficulties or cash shortfalls in the vehicles.
If required by the vehicle, the facility is drawn with the amount advanced included within loans and advances on the balance sheet.
Upon an event of default or other triggering event, the Group may acquire control of a CDO and, therefore, be required to fully consolidate the vehicle for accounting purposes.
The potential for transactions to hit default triggers before the end of 2011 has been assessed and is included in the determination of a 6m impairment charge 2010: 137m release in relation to ABS CDO Super Senior and other credit market exposures for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The Groups exposure to ABS CDO Super Senior positions before hedging was 1,842m as at 31 December 2011 2010: 1,992m, equivalent to an aggregate 51.68% 2010: 50.97% decline in value on average for all investors.
This represents the Groups exposure to High Grade CDOs, stated net of write downs and charges.
These facilities are fully drawn and included within loans and advances on the balance sheet.
Collateral The collateral underlying unconsolidated CDOs comprised 78% 2010: 78% residential mortgage-backed securities, 2% 2010: 3% non-residential asset-backed securities and 20% 2010: 19% in other categories a proportion of which will be backed by residential mortgage collateral.
The remaining Weighted Average Life WAL of all collateral is 7.41 years 2010: 6.25 years.
The combined Net Asset Value NAV for all of the CDOs was 1bn 2010: 1bn.
Funding The CDOs were funded with senior unrated notes and rated notes up to AAA.
The capital structure senior to the AAA notes on cash CDOs was supported by a liquidity facility provided by the Group.
The senior portion covered by liquidity facilities is on average 82% of the capital structure.
The initial WAL of the notes in issue averaged 6.7 years 2010: 6.7 years.
The full contractual maturity is 38.2 years 2010: 38.2 years The strategic report Governance Risk management Financial review Financial statements Shareholder information Barclays PLC Annual Report 2011 www.

These interests are held as trading assets or liabilities on the Groups balance sheet and measured at fair value.
The Group has not provided liquidity facilities or similar agreements to third party CDOs.
Structured investment vehicles SIVs The Group does not structure or manage SIVs.
Group exposure to third party SIVs comprised: nil 2010: nil of senior liquidity facilities and derivative exposures included on the balance sheet at their net fair value of 6m 2010: 46m.
SIV-Lites The Group has no exposure to a SIV-Lite transaction.
The Group is not involved in its ongoing management.
Exposures have decreased to nil 2010: 345m representing assets designated at fair value.
Commercial paper CP and medium-term note conduits The Group provided 14bn 2010: 17bn in undrawn backstop liquidity facilities to its own sponsored CP conduits.
The Group fully consolidates these entities such that the underlying assets are reected on the Group balance sheet.
These consolidated entities in turn provide facilities of 717m 2010: 740m to third party conduits containing prime UK buy-to-let Residential Mortgage Backed Securities RMBS assets.
As at 31 December 2011, the entire facility had been drawn and is included in available for sale financial investments.
The Group provided backstop facilities to support the paper issued by one third party conduit.
This facility totalled 259m 2010: 129m, with underlying collateral comprising 100% auto loans.
There were no drawings on this facility as at 31 December 2011.
The Group provided backstop facilities to five third party SPEs that fund themselves with medium term notes.
These notes are sold to investors as a series of 12 month securities and remarketed to investors annually.
If investors decline to renew their holdings at a price below a pre-agreed spread, the backstop facility requires the Group to purchase the outstanding notes at scheduled maturity.
The Group has provided facilities of 0.9bn 2010: 1.2bn to SPEs holding prime UK and Australian owner-occupied RMBS assets.
As at the balance sheet date these facilities had been drawn and were included in loans and advances.
45 Assets pledged Assets are pledged as collateral to secure liabilities under repurchase agreements, securitisations and stock lending agreements or as security deposits relating to derivatives.
