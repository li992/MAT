Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand.
Cash equivalents comprise money market funds which are realisable on demand and loans and advances to banks with a maturity of less than three months from the date of acquisition.
For the purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Share-based payments The Group engages in share-based payment transactions in respect of services received from certain employees.
In relation to equity settled share-based payments, the fair value of the services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares or share options granted on the date of the grant.
The cost of the employee services received in respect of the shares or share options granted is recognised in profit or loss over the vesting period, with a corresponding credit to equity.
The fair value of the options granted is determined using option pricing models, which take into account the exercise price of the option, the current share price, the risk-free interest rate, the expected volatility of the Companys share price over the life of the option award and other relevant factors.
Except for those which include terms related to market conditions, vesting conditions included in the terms of the grant are not taken into account in estimating fair value.
Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of shares or share options included in the measurement of the cost of employee services so that ultimately, the amount recognised in profit or loss reflects the number of vested shares or share options, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
Where vesting conditions are related to market conditions, the charges for the services received are recognised regardless of whether or not the market related vesting condition is met, provided that the non-market vesting conditions are met.
Shares purchased and issued are charged directly to equity.
For cash-settled share-based payments, a liability is recognised for the services received, measured initially at the fair value of the liability.
At the date on which the liability is settled, and at each balance sheet date between grant date and settlement, the fair value of the liability is remeasured with any changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss for the year.
Segmental reporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Group executive committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components, whose operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group executive committee to make decisions about resources allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Operating segments are organised around the services provided to clients: a description of the services provided by each segment is given in Rathbones at a glance on page 9.
No operating segments have been aggregated in the Groups financial statements.
Transactions between operating segments are reported within the income or expenses for those segments.
Indirect costs are allocated between segments in proportion to the principal cost driver for each category of indirect costs that is generated by each segment.
Fiduciary activities The Group commonly acts as trustee and in other fiduciary capacities that result in the holding or placing of assets on behalf of individuals, trusts, retirement benefit plans and other institutions.
Such assets and income arising thereon are excluded from these financial statements, as they are not assets of the Group.
The Group holds money on behalf of some clients in accordance with the Client Money Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
Such monies and the corresponding amounts due to clients are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled to them.
Financial guarantees The Group provides a limited number of financial guarantees which are fully backed by assets in clients portfolios.
Financial guarantees are initially recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Guarantees are subsequently measured at the higher of the best estimate of any amount to be paid to settle the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisation, which is recognised over the life of the contract.
76 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty The Group makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Financial Services Compensation Scheme levies note 7 The arrangements put in place by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS to protect depositors and investors from loss in the event of failure of financial institutions have resulted in significant levies on the industry in recent years.
The financial impact of FSCS levies are largely out of the Groups control as they result from other industry failures.
In February 2011, the Group received invoices totalling 3.2 million in relation to interim levies by the FSCS following the failure of Keydata Investment Services Limited Keydata and other intermediaries.
These charges were presented as an exceptional levy in the financial statements in 2010.
No such exceptional levies have been accrued in 2011 as no further large and unexpected levies have been made by the FSCS.
Levies of 353,000 have been included within administrative expenses in 2011.
There is a significant degree of uncertainty over the level of future FSCS levies as this depends on the ultimate cost to the FSCS of the failure of other entities in the financial services industry.
The FSCS announced in its December 2011 Outlook Statement that it expects to have to raise an interim levy of 40 million against the investment intermediary class of firms, which includes a number of Group companies, following additional compensation costs incurred from Keydata and other stockbrokers.
An accrual of 36,000 has been charged to profit or loss in 2011 for the Groups share of this.
Against this, the FSCS is pursuing recoveries from parties found to be responsible for mis-selling Keydata investments.
Whilst any recoveries are expected to reduce future levies, the amount and timing of these reductions is unknown.
The FSCS has also announced that it is considering whether it will be able to pay claims to investors who have incurred losses on investments with CF Arch Cru Funds and MF Global Investors, following the failure of both entities.
The FSCS has not yet quantified the likely cost of compensation to affected investors but it notes that, if such compensation is payable, the additional levies would likely trigger a cross-subsidy by the investment management class of firms, which would be a cost to the Group.
It is currently not possible to quantify the impact of these failures.
We understand that the FSCS 15 in the process of re-negotiating the terms of the 18 billion of loans that it took out in 2008 09 to cover the costs of five major depositor failures, and that the FSCS hopes to bring these negotiations to a conclusion before the end of June 2012.
Any increase in the interest cost of these loans will result in an increase in the annual costs of the FSCS levies borne by the Group.
Vendor loan notes note 14 The Group holds vendor loan notes Notes with a nominal value of 5,000,000 issued by the acquirer of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008.
The Notes are repayable on the occurrence of certain events, principally the refinancing of the operations disposed of.
The carrying value of the Notes has been calculated as 3,268,000 using a discounted cash flow model based on the estimated repayment date, using a discount rate equal to the initial effective interest rate of the loan.
Changing the estimated repayment date of the Notes by one year would result in an increase or decrease in their carrying value of approximately 294,000.
A 1% increase decrease in the assumed rate at which interest accrues under the loan would increase decrease the carrying value of the loan by approximately 100,000, with a consequent equal change in profit before tax.
Client relationship intangibles note 19 The Group makes estimates about the expected duration of client relationships to determine the period over which related intangible assets are amortised.
The amortisation period is estimated with reference to historical data on account closure rates and managements expectations for the future.
During the year client relationship intangible assets were amortised over a 10 15 year period.
Amortisation of 5,134,000 was charged during the year.
A reduction in the average amortisation period of one year would increase the amortisation charge by approximately 453,000.
In determining whether a client relationship is lost, management consider factors such as the level of funds withdrawn and the existence of other retained family relationships.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation and uncertainty continued Retirement benefit obligations note 24 The Group makes estimates about a range of long term trends and market conditions to determine the value of the deficit on its retirement benefit schemes, based on the Groups expectations of the future and advice taken from qualified actuaries.
The principal assumptions underlying the reported deficit of 7,340,000 are given in note 24.
Long term forecasts and estimates are necessarily highly judgemental and subject to risk that actual events may be significantly different to those forecast.
If actual events deviate from the assumptions made by the Group then the reported surplus or deficit in respect of retirement benefit obligations may be materially different.
The history of experience adjustments and information on the sensitivity of the retirement benefit obligations to changes in underlying estimates is set out in note 24.
3 Segmental information For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into two operating divisions: Investment Management and Unit Trusts.
The products and services from which each reportable segment derives its revenues are described in Rathbones at a glance on page 9.
These segments are the basis on which the Group reports its performance to the executive committee, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
Certain items of income are presented within different categories of operating income in the financial statements compared to the presentation for internal reporting.
Following the completion of the disposal of the Groups overseas trust businesses, the presentation of segmental information has been amended to include the remaining trust and tax operations within the Investment Management segment.
This change reflects managements view that the retained trust-related activities support the investment management business and are not sufficiently material in their own right to constitute a separate segment of the business.

The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated as follows: 2010 2011 000 000 Investment management 45,287 45,287 Trust and tax 1,954 1,954 47,241 47,241 The recoverable amounts of goodwill allocated to the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on industry growth forecasts.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management, covering the forthcoming year based on flat market assumptions and organic growth in line with historical rates.
Budgets are extrapolated for up to ten years based on a medium to long term growth rate of 3% for the investment management CGU and 2% for the trust and tax CGU based on managements expectation of future industry growth rates.
A ten year extrapolation period is chosen based on managements expectation of the duration of client relationships.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 10% for investment management and 12% for trust and tax 2010: 10% and 12% respectively, based on a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital.
Management judge these discount rates to appropriately reflect the markets in which the CGUs operate and, in particular, the relatively small size of the trust and tax CGU.

Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 91 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 23 Other provisions continued During the ordinary course of business the Group may be subject to complaints, threatened and actual legal proceedings which may include lawsuits brought on behalf of clients or other third parties both in the UK and overseas.
Any such material matters are periodically reassessed, with the assistance of external professional advisors where appropriate, to determine the likelihood of the Group incurring a liability.
In those instances where it is concluded that it is more likely than not that a payment will be made, a provision is established to managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the obligation at the relevant balance sheet date.
The timing of settlement of provisions for client compensation or litigation is dependent, in part, on the duration of negotiations with third parties.
Property related and other provisions include 920,000 2010: nil in relation to dilapidation costs and 276,000 2010: nil of onerous lease costs arising from the relocation of the current head office premises from New Bond Street to 1 Curzon Street, London W1J 5FB note 8.
The non-current element of provisions totals 5,745,000 as at 31 December 2011 2010: 3,158,000.
Non-current provisions are expected to be settled within 24 months of the balance sheet date.
24 Long term employee benefits The Group operates a defined contribution group personal pension scheme and contributes to various other personal pension arrangements for certain directors and employees.
The total of contributions made to this scheme during the year was 1,750,000 2010: 1,295,000.
The Group also operates a defined contribution scheme for overseas employees, for which the total contributions were 21,000 2010: 21,000.
The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes: the Rathbone 1987 Scheme and the Laurence Keen Scheme.
The schemes are currently both clients of Rathbone Investment Management, with investments managed on a discretionary basis, in accordance with the statements of investment principles agreed by the trustees.
Scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group.
The trustees of the schemes are required to act in the best interest of the schemes beneficiaries.
The appointment of trustees is determined by the schemes trust documentation and legislation.
The Group has a policy that one third of all trustees should be nominated by members of the schemes.
The Laurence Keen Scheme was closed to new entrants and future accrual with effect from 30 September 1999.
Past service benefits continue to be calculated by reference to final pensionable salaries.
From 1 October 1999, all the active members of the Laurence Keen Scheme were included under the Rathbone 1987 Scheme for accrual of retirement benefits for further service.
The Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 31 March 2002.
The Group provides death in service benefits to all employees through the Rathbone 1987 Scheme.
Third party insurance is purchased for the benefits where possible and 539,000 of related insurance premiums were expensed to profit or loss in the year 2010: 519,000.
The estimated present value of the uninsured death in service benefits is included in long term employee benefits liabilities.
The schemes are valued by independent actuaries at least every three years using the projected unit credit method, which looks at the value of benefits accruing over the years following the valuation date based on projected salary to the date of termination of services, discounted to a present value using a rate that reflects the characteristics of the liability.
The valuations are updated at each balance sheet date in between full valuations.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: Rathbone 1987 Scheme 31 December 2010 Laurence Keen Scheme 31 December 2010 92 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24 Long term employee benefits continued The assumptions used by the actuaries, in preparing this note, are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered by the liability, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The expected rate of return on debt instruments is based on long term yields at the start of the year.
Cash has been assumed to generate a similar return to the Bank of England base rate.
The statements of investment principles set by the trustees require that the assets of the schemes are invested in a balanced portfolio in the following asset classes and proportions: Laurence Keen Scheme Rathbone 1987 Scheme UK equities 35% 55% 43% 57% Overseas equities 0% 20% 21% 35% Fixed interest stocks 45% 65% 14% 28% Cash deposits 45% 65% 0% 8% The total allocation of assets in the Laurence Keen Scheme to fixed interest stocks and cash deposits is expressed as a combined percentage of the two asset classes in the statement of investment principles In the Rathbone 1987 Scheme, not more than 80% of the assets may be held in equities.
A maximum of 5% of UK equities may be invested in companies outside the FTSE 350 and not more than 5% of the total portfolio can be invested in hedge funds.
The trustees have initiated a process of fide-risking the portfolio over the next 10 years as the scheme matures by switching a proportion of the schemes assets into lower risk asset classes on the occurrence of a series of time-based and or market-based trigger events.

Additional lump sum contributions of 2,750,000 were paid in 2011 2010: 2,958,000.
Following the recent triennial valuation, the Groups regular contributions will fall to 14.8% of pensionable salaries and the Group has committed to make additional annual contributions to the scheme of 2,750,000 until 30 June 2017.
With effect from 31 March 2002 the Rathbone 1987 Scheme was closed to new entrants and, consequently, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total contributions made by the Group to the Laurence Keen Scheme during the year were 756,000 2010: 756,000.
Annual contributions of 756,000 will continue to be made to the Laurence Keen Scheme until April 2013.
Thereafter, annual contributions of 336,000 will be made until December 2017.
As the scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 October 1999, the current pension cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.

27 Share-based payments Share Incentive Plan The Group operates a Share Incentive Plan SIP, which is available to all employees.
Employees can contribute up to 125 per month to acquire shares which are purchased or allotted twice a year at the end of six-month accumulation periods.
The Group currently matches employee contributions on a one-for-one basis to acquire matching shares.
The Group also provides performance-related free shares, with eligible employees receiving shares valued at the rate of 100 per 1% real increase in EPS up to a maximum of 3,000 per annum.
For UK employees, SIP dividends are reinvested and used to purchase dividend shares up to 1,500 in any tax year, whilst for Jersey employees dividends are paid in cash.
As at 31 December 2011, the trustees of the SIP held 1,394,076 2010: 1,316,557 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 14,777,000 2010: 14,403,000.

Shares for plan awards are provided by market purchase, treasury shares or from the Rathbone Brothers Plc Settlement.
Historically, the Group has elected to settle substantially all of the LTIP awards in cash as an alternative to shares.
As a consequence of this, the Group treats awards under the LTIP as cash-settled rather than equity-settled.
At the year end, a liability of 1,175,000 2010: 795,000 has been recognised for the estimated fair value of future awards.
At 31 December 2011, the trustees held 106,604 2010: 112,693 ordinary shares of 5p each in Rathbone Brothers Plc with a total market value of 1,130,000 2010: 1,233,000.

98 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management The Group has identified the risks arising from its activities and has established policies and procedures to manage these items in accordance with its risk appetite, as described in the risk management report on page 23.
The Group categorises its financial risks into three areas: i credit risk which includes counterparty default risk : ii liquidity risk: and iii market risk which includes fair value interest rate risk, cash flow interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk and price risk.
The sections below outline the Groups risk appetite and explain how it defines and manages each category of financial risk.
The Groups risk management policies are designed to identify and analyse the risks that the Group faces, to set appropriate risk limits and controls and to monitor the risks and adherence to limits by means of reliable and up-to-date information systems.
The Group regularly reviews its risk management policies and systems to reflect changes in the business, counterparties, markets and the range of financial instruments that it utilises.
The Groups overall strategy and policies for monitoring and management of financial risk are set by the Board of directors the Board.
The Board has embedded risk management within the business through the boards of directors of the Groups operating subsidiaries and certain of the Boards standing committees.
The risk management committee has primary responsibility for co-ordinating and overseeing the identification, mitigation and management of risks as described in the risk management report.
The treasury department, reporting through the banking committee, has principal responsibility for monitoring exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk and market risk.
Procedures and delegated authorities are documented in a Group treasury manual and policy documents are in place to cover the management and monitoring of each type of risk.
The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short term liquidity requirements whilst maintaining an appropriate level of exposure to other financial risks in accordance with the Groups risk appetite.
Eurozone credit crisis During the second half of 2011, concerns have grown about the strength and stability of certain eurozone economies, in particular whether the Greek, Italian or Spanish governments would default on their debt.
This, in turn, increased speculation on the future of the Euro and whether the more heavily indebted countries would continue to participate in it.
A break-up of the Euro, should it occur, is likely to result in a protracted recession in the Euro area and wider disruption to global financial markets.
Such an event would be expected to have an adverse effect on the Groups trading conditions.
This might include falls in the values of financial assets, the potential loss of capital and liquidity through counterparty defaults and further reductions in interest rate margins.
The Groups treasury portfolio is well diversified and invests in certificates of deposit with a number of European banks.
At 31 December 2011, the Group had no direct exposure to eurozone sovereign entities 2010: none.
The controls around the treasury portfolio are set out below.
The banking committee has been particularly active this year in assessing the expected impact of the eurozone issues.
As a result, during the year it has moved increasing amounts of money into UK treasury bills.
By the end of the year these totalled some 9.6% of the total treasury assets of 909,593,000, of which all were rated Fitch single A or above.
The duration of these assets is set out in the table on page 106. i Credit risk The Group takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due, through its banking, treasury, trust and pensions advisory activities.
The principal source of credit risk arises from placing funds with other banks and holding interest-bearing securities.
The Group also has exposure to credit risk through its loan books, guarantees given on clients behalf and loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey and Switzerland operations in 2008 and 2009.
It is the Groups policy to place funds generated internally and from deposits by clients with a range of high-quality financial institutions.
Investments are spread to avoid excessive exposure to any individual counterparty.
Loans made to clients are secured against clients assets that are held and managed by Group companies.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 99 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued Exposure to credit risk is managed through setting appropriate ratings requirements and lending limits.
Limits are reviewed regularly, taking into account the ability of borrowers and potential borrowers to meet repayment obligations.
The Group categorises its exposures based on the long term ratings awarded to counterparties by Fitch Ratings Ltd Fitch or Moodys Corporation Moodys.
Each exposure is assessed individually, both at inception and in ongoing monitoring.
In addition to formal external ratings, the banking committee also utilises market intelligence information to assist its ongoing monitoring.
Settlement balances Settlement risk arises in any situation where a payment in cash or transfer of a security is made in the expectation of a corresponding delivery of a security or receipt of cash.
The majority of transactions are carried out on a delivery versus payment basis, which results in securities and cash being exchanged within a very close timeframe.
Settlement balances outside standard terms are monitored on a daily basis.
The Investment Management and Unit Trust businesses have exposure to market counterparties in the settlement of trades.
Settlement balances arising in the Investment Management segment are primarily in relation to client trades and risk of non-settlement is borne by clients.
Loans and advances to banks and debt and other securities The Group has exposures to a wide range of financial institutions through its treasury portfolio, which includes bank deposits, certificates of deposit, money market funds and government bonds.
These exposures principally arise from the placement of surplus investment management client cash, which is held under a banking relationship, and the Groups own reserves.
The Groups policy requires that all such exposures are only taken with counterparties that have been awarded a minimum long term rating of A by Fitch or equivalent rating by Moodys.
Counterparty limits are also in place to limit exposure to an individual counterparty or connected group of counterparties.
Counterparty exposures are monitored on a daily basis by the treasury department and reviewed by the banking committee on a monthly basis, or more frequently when necessary.
The banking committee may suspend dealing in a particular counterparty, or liquidate specific holdings, in the light of adverse market information.
Loans and advances to customers The Group provides loans to clients through its investment management operations the investment management loan book.
The Group is also exposed to credit risk on trade debtors arising from the trust, tax and pensions advisory businesses trust and pension debtors.
a Overdrafts Overdrafts on clients investment management accounts arise from time to time due to short term timing differences between the purchase and sale of assets on a clients behalf.
Overdrafts are actively monitored and reported to the banking committee on a monthly basis.
b Investment management loan book Loans and short term overdrafts are provided as a service to investment management clients who are generally asset rich but have short to medium term cash requirements.
Such loans are normally made on a fully secured basis against portfolios held in Rathbones nominee name and are advanced for a maximum of one year.
Extensions to the initial loan period may be granted subject to credit criteria.
The banking committee reviews all loans on a monthly basis and approves all loan extensions.
Where necessary, repayment plans are established with clients before loans become overdue or uncovered.
At 31 December 2011, the total lending exposure limit for the investment management loan book was 60,000,000 2010: 45,000,000, of which 36,434,000 had been advanced 2010: 31,957,000 and a further 6,925,000 had been committed 2010: 7,724,000. c Trust and pension debtors Trust and pension debtors relate to fees which have been invoiced but not yet settled by clients.
The collection and ageing of trust and pension debtors are reviewed on a monthly basis by the management committees of the Groups trust and pension advisory companies.
Impairment provisions are made for any debts which are considered to be doubtful for collection.
100 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued i Credit risk continued d Other debtors Other loans and advances to customers are constituted by loans made to the acquirers of the Groups Jersey trust operations in 2008, and its Switzerland trust operations in 2009, and other loans note 14.
Such debts do not usually arise within the course of the Groups day to day operations and therefore they are not subject to formalised standard lending criteria.
Impairment and provisioning policies Impairment provisions are recognised for financial reporting purposes only for losses that have been incurred at the balance sheet date, based on objective evidence of impairment.
All credit exposures are reviewed individually, at least annually, or more regularly when individual circumstances require.
Impairment allowances on credit exposures are determined by an evaluation of the incurred loss at the balance sheet date on a case by case basis.
The assessment considers, where applicable, the value of any collateral held, any changes to the external credit rating and the anticipated receipts for each individual exposure.
Impairment provisions for credit risk, which relate solely to trust and pension debtors, are set out in note 14.
No other impairment losses arose during the year 2010: none.

All loans initially made subject to standard lending criteria remained within those criteria at 31 December 2011 2010: all loans.
An exposure is reported as past due when the contractual due date for settlement has passed and the balance has not been repaid, except in the case of trust and pension debtors, where a normal settlement period of up to 30 days is expected.

The banking committee actively monitors counterparties and may reduce risk by either suspending dealing or liquidating investments in the light of adverse market information, for example in anticipation of or in response to any formal Fitch or Moodys rating downgrade.
This may happen in relation to specific banks or banks within a particular country or sector.

The primary objective of the Groups treasury policy is to manage short to medium term liquidity requirements and Rathbone Investment Management the Bank performs an annual assessment of liquidity adequacy in accordance with the requirements outlined in BIPRU 12 our Individual Liquidity Adequacy Assessment.
The Bank faces two principal risks, namely that a significant proportion of client funds are withdrawn over a short period of time retail funding risk and the risk that marketable assets may not be capable of being realised in the time and at the value required marketable assets risk.
Retail funding risks are managed by daily cash mismatch analyses using expected cash and asset maturity profiles and regular forecasting work.
This is supported by stress tests which cover firm-specific idiosyncratic scenarios and or the effects of unforeseen market wide stresses.
Strict tolerance and early warning criteria are also set to control any liquidity mismatches.
Marketable assets risk is primarily managed by holding cash and marketable instruments that are realisable at short notice.
The Group operates strict criteria to ensure that investments are liquid and placed with high-quality counterparties.
A minimum liquid assets buffer to be held in eligible liquid assets is set by the Board at least annually.
The Group does not rely on external funding for its activities.

Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates.
The Groups principal exposure to cash flow interest rate risk arises from the mismatch between the repricing of its financial assets and liabilities.
In particular, customer accounts and loan balances are repriced very shortly after changes in base rates, whereas the yield on the Groups interest-bearing assets is correlated to the future expectation of base rates and varies depending on the maturity profile of the Groups treasury portfolio.
The average maturity mismatch is controlled by the banking committee, which generally lengthens the mismatch when the yield curve is expected to rise and shortens it when the yield curve is expected to fall.
The table below shows the consolidated repricing profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, stated at their carrying amounts, categorised by the earlier of contractual repricing or maturity dates.

The potential total profit or loss is calculated on the basis of the average number of days to repricing of the interest-bearing liabilities compared with the period to repricing on a corresponding amount of interest-bearing assets.
At 31 December 2011, the Bank had 876.2 million 2010: 734.2 million of Sterling interest-bearing liabilities averaging two days 2010: two days to repricing, which were matched by Sterling assets averaging 65 days 2010: 89 days to repricing, creating an exposure of 63 days 2010: 87 days.
The total potential impact on profit after tax and equity was 2,211,000 2010: 2,542,000 at the balance sheet date for a 2% decrease or increase in interest rates.
The Group held no forward rate agreements at 31 December 2011 2010: none.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to translational foreign exchange risk as it undertakes transactions in foreign currencies and is therefore exposed to changes in foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
The Group monitors its currency exposures that arise in the ordinary course of business on a daily basis and significant exposures are managed through the use of spot contracts, from time to time, so as to reduce any currency exposure to a minimal amount.
The Groups structural currency exposure was eliminated on the disposal of its Switzerland, Singapore, British Virgin Islands and Dutch operations during 2009 and 2010.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 109 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued The Group does not have any material exposure to transactional foreign exchange risk.
The table below summarises the Groups exposure to foreign currency translation risk at 31 December 2011.
Included in the table are the Groups financial assets and liabilities, at carrying amounts, categorised by currency.
A 10% weakening of the Euro against Sterling, occurring on 31 December 2011, would have reduced equity and profit after tax by 50,000 2010: 85,000.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro would have had an equal and opposite effect.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates, remain constant.
110 Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Financial risk management continued iii Market risk continued Price risk Price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices other than those arising from interest rate risk or foreign exchange risk.
The Group is exposed to price risk through its holdings of equity investment securities, which are reported at their fair value note 15.
At 31 December 2011, the fair value of equity securities recognised on the balance sheet was 2,953,000 2010: 3,087,000.
A 10% fall in global equity markets would, in isolation, result in a pre-tax impact on net assets of 295,000 2010: 309,000 : there would be no impact on profit after tax.
A 10% rise in global markets would have had an equal and opposite effect.
Fair values The fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are not materially different from their carrying values, with the exception of held to maturity investment securities note 15.
The table below analyses financial instruments measured at fair value into a fair value hierarchy based on the valuation technique used to determine the fair value.
Level 1: quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2011 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 2,384 569 2,953 money market funds 65,610 65,610 Total financial assets 2,384 66,179 68,563 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total At 31 December 2010 000 000 000 000 Assets Available for sale securities: equity securities 2,513 574 3,087 money market funds 39,500 39,500 Total financial assets 2,513 40,074 42,587 The fair value of unlisted equity securities is calculated by reference to net asset values with a liquidity discount applied.
The fair value of money market funds is their daily redemption value.
There have been no transfers between levels during the year.
Money market funds are demand securities and changes to estimates of interest rates will not affect their fair value.
Rathbone Brothers Plc Report and accounts 2011 111 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 29 Capital management Rathbone Brothers Plcs capital is defined for accounting purposes as total equity.
The Company has no external borrowings at 31 December 2011 2010: 3,089,000 note 20.
The Groups objectives when managing capital are to: safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: maintain a strong capital base to be able to support the development of the business when required: optimise the distribution of capital across Group companies reflecting the requirements of each business: strive to make capital freely transferable across the Group where possible: and comply with regulatory requirements at all times.
Rathbones is classified under the Capital Requirements Directive CRD as a banking group and performs an Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP, which is presented to the FSA on an annual basis.
Regulatory capital resources for ICAAP purposes are calculated in accordance with CRD rules.
These require certain adjustments to and certain deductions from accounting capital, the latter largely in respect of intangible assets.
The ICAAP compares regulatory capital resources against regulatory capital requirements derived using the CRDs Pillar I and Pillar II methodology.
The Group has adopted the standardised approach to calculating its Pillar I credit risk component and the basic indicator approach to calculating its operational risk component.
Capital management policy and practices are applied at both Group and entity level.
At 31 December 2011 the Groups regulatory capital resources, including retained earnings for 2011, were 89,770,000 2010: 85,250,000.
The increase in reserves during 2011 was partially offset by an increase in intangible assets.
In addition to a variety of stress tests performed as part of the ICAAP process, and daily reporting in respect of treasury activity, capital levels are monitored and forecasted on a monthly basis to ensure that dividends and investment requirements are appropriately managed and appropriate buffers are kept against adverse business conditions.
Regular exercises are also run to ensure that the Groups structures remain optimal.
Regulatory capital requirements have been met throughout the financial years ended 31 December 2010 and 2011.
30 Contingent liabilities and commitments a Indemnities are provided to a number of directors and employees who provide tax and trust advisory services in connection with them acting as directors on client structures in the normal course of business.
b Capital expenditure authorised and contracted for at 31 December 2011 but not provided in the financial statements amounted to 2,223,000 2010: 594,000. c The contractual amounts of the Groups commitments to extend credit to its clients are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Guarantees 578 583 Undrawn commitments to lend of 1 year or less 6,925 7,724 7,503 8,307 The fair value of the guarantees is nil 2010: nil.
d The Group leases various offices and other assets under non-cancellable operating lease agreements.
The leases have varying terms and renewal rights.
During 2011 the Group committed to take on a 12 year lease at 1 Curzon Street, London and extended the lease on the Port of Liverpool Building.
The Groups agreement to lease space at 1 Curzon Street, London provides for an upward only reset to market rents in 2018.
