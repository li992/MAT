VALUE THROUGH DEVELOPING, REPOSITIONING ASSETS AND EXPLOITING MARKET ANOMALIES Where we see the right opportunity, we will invest a proportion of our capital in assets with the objective of creating incremental value.
A good recent example is the office market in Central London where a shortage of high-quality space coupled with a lack of development debt finance is expected to underpin strong development returns.
Over the last year, we have committed 1.6 billion British Land share: 1.1 billion to Central Londons largest office development programme.
This will deliver 2.2 million sq ft of prime office space to the market between 2012 and 2014 against a backdrop of constrained supply, rising rents and capital values.
During 2011, we expect to put more capital behind investments where we believe we can reposition assets and exploit market anomalies.
