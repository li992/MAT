8Goodwill Accounting policy Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually.
Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit CGU that is expected to benefit from the acquisition.
The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually.
For purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related CGUs monitored by management, being the business segment level, Orthopaedics, Endoscopy and Advanced Wound Management.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash ow projections.
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals.
If actual results should differ, or changes in expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred.
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets.

These are updated during December, taking into account significant events that occurred between September and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash ow projections for five years using data from the Groups budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board.
These projections exclude any estimated future cash inows or outows expected to arise from future restructurings.
The five-year period is in line with the Groups strategic planning process.
The calculation of value-in-use for the three identied CGUs is most sensitive to discount and growth rates as set out below: The discount rate reects managements assessment of risks specic to the assets of each CGU.
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Orthopaedics business is 10% 2010 11%, for the Endoscopy businesses it is 11% 2010 15% and for the Advanced Wound Management business it is 9% 2010 10%.
In determining the growth rate used in the calculation of the value-in-use, the Group considered the annual sales growth and trading profit margins.
Projections are based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements.
Each year the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year.
Growth rates for the five year period for the Orthopaedics business vary up to 6% 2010 9%, for the Endoscopy business up to 13% 2010 10% and for the Advanced Wound Management business up to 8% 2010 8%.
Specic considerations and strategies taken into account in determining the sales growth and trading profit margin for each CGU are: Orthopaedics In the Orthopaedic CGU management intends to deliver growth through continuing to focus on the customer, high quality customer service and innovative product development, and through continuing to improve efficiencies.
Endoscopy It is managements intent to maintain and grow this CGU as the leading provider of endoscopic techniques and technologies for joint and ligament repair.
This is driven partly through the growing acceptance of Endoscopy as a preferred surgical choice amongst physicians and patients, product innovation, high quality customer service, and supporting surgeon educational programmes.
Advanced Wound Management Management intends to develop this CGU by focusing on the higher added value sectors of exudate and infection management through improved wound bed preparation, moist and active healing and negative pressure wound therapy, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
A long-term growth rate of 4% 2010 4% in pre-tax cash ows is assumed after five years in calculating a terminal value for the Groups CGUs.
Management considers this to be an appropriate estimate based on the growth rates of the markets in which the Group operates.
Capital expenditure represents the Groups expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets.
This is approximately 8% 2010 8% of annual revenue.
