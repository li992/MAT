Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2011 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for the assets.
The principal accounting policies adopted, which have been applied consistently to the results, other gains and losses, assets, liabilities and cash flows of entities included in the consolidated financial statements in the current and preceding year, are set out below.
Going concern A review of the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out on pages 22 to 39 of the Business and Financial Review.
The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are shown in the balance sheet, cash flow statement and accompanying notes in the financial statements.
Further information concerning the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk can be found in the Business and Financial Review.
After reviewing Group and Company cash balances, borrowing facilities and projected cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group and Company have adequate resources to continue operations for the foreseeable future.
In reaching this conclusion the Directors have had regard to the Groups operating plan and budget for the year ended 31 March 2012 and projections contained in the longer term business plan which covers the period to March 2016.
The Directors have considered carefully the Groups trading performance and cash flows as a result of the uncertain global economic environment and the other principal risks to the Groups performance.
For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 March each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Big Yellow Group PLC and all of its subsidiaries at the year end using acquisition accounting principles.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
The acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets or disposal groups that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
If, after reassessment, the Groups interest in the net fair value of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Investment in subsidiaries These are recognised at cost less provision for any impairment.
Investment in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale see below.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
Losses of an associate in excess of the Groups interest in that associate which includes any long-term interests that, in substance, form part of the Groups net investment in the associate are recognised only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
Where a Group company transacts with an associate of the Group, profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the relevant associate.
Losses may provide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred in which case appropriate provision is made for impairment.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and any applicable value added tax.
Income is recognised over the period for which the storage room is occupied by the customer.
The Group recognises non-storage income over the period in which it is earned.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
Management fees earned are recognised over the period for which the services are provided.
Franchise fees are recognised in the income statement as they fall contractually due to the Group.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Bank borrowings Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs are accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate method and are added to the carrying value amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Finance costs All borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred, unless the costs are incurred as part of the development of a qualifying asset, when they will be capitalised.
Commencement of capitalisation is the date when the Group incurs expenditure for the qualifying asset, incurs borrowing costs and undertakes activities that are necessary to prepare the assets for their intended use when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the entity and the costs can be measured reliably.
In the case of suspension of activities during extended periods, the Group suspends capitalisation.
The Group ceases capitalisation of borrowing costs when substantially all of the activities necessary to prepare the asset for use are complete.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated after gains and losses on surplus land, movements on the revaluation of investment properties and before the share of results of associates, investment income and finance costs.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from the net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates substantively enacted at the balance sheet date that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
79 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2011 2.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Plant, equipment & owner occupied property All property, plant and equipment, not classified as investment property, are carried at historic cost less depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, other than land and properties under construction, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases: Freehold property 50 years Freehold improvements 20 years Leasehold improvements Over period of the lease Plant and machinery 10 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Computer equipment 3 years Motor vehicles 4 years The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in income.
Investment property The criterion used to distinguish investment property from owner-occupied property is to consider whether the property is held for rental income and for capital appreciation.
Where this is the case, the Group recognises these owned or leased properties as investment properties.
Investment property is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
In accordance with IAS40, investment property held leasehold is stated gross of the recognised finance lease liability.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property are included in the income statement of the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Leasehold properties that are leased under operating leases are classified as investment properties and included in the balance sheet at fair value.
The obligation to the lessor for the buildings element of the leasehold is included in the balance sheet at the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception, and is shown within note 13a.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and a reduction of the outstanding lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Investment property under construction Investment property under construction is initially recognised at cost and revalued at the balance sheet date to fair value as determined by professionally qualified external valuers.
Gains or losses arising from the changes in fair value of investment property under construction are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
In accordance with IAS 40, as the Group uses the fair value model, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties including integral plant.
Surplus land Surplus land is recognised at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Any gains and losses on surplus land are recognised through the income statement.
Impairment of assets At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets net selling price and its value-in-use ie the net present value of its future cash flows discounted at the Groups average pre-tax interest rate that reflects the borrowing costs and risk for the asset.
Inventories Inventories, which are packing materials, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of interest rates.
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board of Directors.
The policy in respect of interest rates is to maintain a balance between flexibility and the hedging of interest rate risk.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently reviewed at each balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate derivatives at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
The Group has not adopted hedge accounting.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains or losses reported in the income statement.
B Loans and receivables Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
C Impairment of financial assets Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date.
Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account.
When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account.
Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account.
Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
D Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximates to the fair value.
E Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
F Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
G Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
H Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Retirement benefit costs Pension costs represent contributions payable to defined contribution schemes and are charged as an expense to the income statement as they fall due.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the share-based payment is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black-Scholes model.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Critical accounting estimates and judgements In the application of the Groups accounting policies, which are described above, the Directors are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a Estimate of fair value of Investment Properties and Investment Property Under Construction The Groups self storage centres and stores under development are valued using a discounted cash flow methodology which is based on projections of net operating income.
The Group employs expert external valuers, Cushman & Wakefield LLP, who report on the values of the Groups stores on a biannual basis.
Principal assumptions underlying managements estimation of the fair value are those related to: stabilised occupancy levels: the absorption period to these stabilised levels: expected future growth in storage rents and operating costs: maintenance requirements: capitalisation rates and discount rates.
A more detailed explanation of the background and methodology adopted in the valuation of the Groups investment properties is set out in note 14 to the accounts.
b Surplus land The Groups surplus land is held in the balance sheet at historic cost less provisions for impairment and is not valued externally.
The Directors review all surplus land assets for impairment at each balance sheet date, considering all available evidence as to the likely proceeds receivable from the sale of the surplus land.
REVENUE Analysis of the Groups operating revenue can be found below and in the Portfolio Summary on page 40.
2011 2011 2010 2010 000 000 000 000 Open stores Self storage revenue 50,690 46,763 Other storage related revenue 8,844 8,282 Ancillary store rental revenue 88 89 59,622 55,134 Stores under development Non-storage income 937 1,232 937 1,232 Fee income Fees earned from Big Yellow Limited Partnership 920 1,198 Other management fees earned 406 406 Franchise fees received 25 1,326 1,629 Revenue per income statement 61,885 57,995 Investment income see note 7 114 386 Total revenue per IAS 18 61,999 58,381 Non-storage income derives principally from rental income earned from tenants of properties awaiting development.
SEGMENTAL INFORMATION IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Chief Executive to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance.
Given the nature of the Groups business, there is one segment, which is the provision of self storage accommodation and related services.
Revenue represents amounts derived from the provision of self storage accommodation and related services which fall within the Groups ordinary activities after deduction of trade discounts and value added tax.
The Groups net assets, revenue and profit before tax are attributable to one activity, the provision of self storage accommodation and related services.
These all arise in the United Kingdom in the current year and prior year.

TAXATION The Group converted to a REIT in January 2007.
As a result the Group does not pay UK corporation tax on the profits and gains from qualifying rental business in the UK provided that it meets certain conditions.
Non-qualifying profits and gains of the Group are subject to corporation tax as normal.
The Group monitors its compliance with the REIT conditions.
There have been no breaches of the conditions to date.

NON-CURRENT ASSETS continued d Investment in associate continued The Partnership has in place a loan facility of 68 million, secured from Royal Bank of Scotland plc and HSBC Bank plc.
The original loan available was 75 million, but this was reduced by 7 million in the year at the Partners request, as projections showed the full amount of the loan would not be drawn.
The loan has a five year term and expires in 2013.
31.8 million of the 62.7 million drawn down at 31 March 2011 has been fixed to 30 June 2013 at a weighted average interest cost post margin of 5.5%.
The balance of the drawn debt is currently paying one month LIBOR plus applicable margin.
The weighted average interest cost post margin at 31 March 2011 of the facility was 4.3%.
The Partnership loan has a loan to value covenant which requires the gross loan to the value of the Partnerships investment property assets to be no more than 60%.
This covenant reduces to 55% from November 2011.
The loan is non-recourse to the Group.
The Group has an option at 31 March 2013, and certain dates thereafter, provided certain Internal Rate of Return IRR hurdles are met, to acquire the assets within the Partnership or the remaining interest in the Partnership not held by the Group.
The price payable is based on the market value of the Partnerships assets and liabilities, and is subject to certain promotes, dependent on the IRR achieved.
The valuation has been carried out in accordance with the RICS Valuation Standards published by The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors the Red Book.
The valuation of each of the investment properties and the investment properties under construction has been prepared on the basis of Market Value as a fully equipped operational entity, having regard to trading potential.
89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2011 14.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued The valuation has been provided for accounts purposes and as such, is a Regulated Purpose Valuation as defined in the Red Book.
In compliance with the disclosure requirements of the Red Book, C&W have confirmed that: The members of the RICS who have been the signatories to the valuations provided to the Group for the same purposes as this valuation have done so since September 2004: C&W have been carrying out this bi-annual valuation for the same purposes as this valuation on behalf of the Group since September 2004: C&W do not provide other significant professional or agency services to the Group: In relation to the preceding financial year of C&W, the proportion of the total fees payable by the Group to the total fee income of the firm is less than 5%: and The fee payable to C&W is a fixed amount per store, and is not contingent on the appraised value.
Market uncertainty C&Ws valuation report comments on valuation uncertainty resulting from the recent global banking crisis coupled with the economic downturn, which have caused a low number of transactions in the market for self storage property.
C&W note that, although there were a number of self storage transactions in 2007, the only significant transactions since 2007 are: 1.
The sale of a 51% share in Shurgard Europe which was announced in January 2008 and completed on 31 March 2008: 2.
The sale of the former Keepsafe portfolio by Macquarie to Alligator Self Storage which was completed in January 2010: and 3.
The purchase by Shurgard Europe of the 80% interests held by its joint venture partner Arcapita in its two European joint venture vehicles, First Shurgard and Second Shurgard.
The price paid was 172 million and the transaction was announced in March 2011.
The two joint ventures owned 72 self storage properties.
C&W observe that in order to provide a rational opinion of value at the present time it is necessary to assume that the self storage sector will continue to perform in a way not greatly different from that being anticipated prior to the credit crunch, however they have reflected negative sentiment in their capitalisation rates and they have reflected current trading conditions in their cash flow projections for each property.
C&W state that there is therefore greater uncertainty attached to their opinion of value than would be anticipated during more active market conditions.
Valuation methodology C&W have adopted different approaches for the valuation of the leasehold and freehold assets as follows: Freehold and long leasehold The valuation is based on a discounted cash flow of the net operating income over a ten year period and notional sale of the asset at the end of the tenth year.
Net operating income is based on projected revenue received less projected operating costs together with a central administration charge of 6% of the estimated annual revenue subject to a cap and a collar.
The initial net operating income is calculated by estimating the net operating income in the first 12 months following the valuation date.
The net operating income in future years is calculated assuming straight-line absorption from day one actual occupancy to an estimated stabilised mature occupancy level.
In the valuation the assumed stabilised occupancy level for the 51 open stores both freeholds and leaseholds at 31 March 2011 averages 83.1% 2010: 84.2%.
The projected revenues and costs have been adjusted for estimated cost inflation and revenue growth.
The average time assumed for the stores to trade at their maturity levels across the portfolio is 41 months 2010: 42 months : for the 32 established stores, the period to maturity is 37 months 2010: 37 months.
C. The capitalisation rates applied to existing and future net cash flow have been estimated by reference to underlying yields for industrial and retail warehouse property, yields for other trading property types such as student housing and hotels, bank base rates, ten year money rates, inflation and the available evidence of transactions in the sector.
The valuation included in the accounts assumes rental growth in future periods.
If an assumption of no rental growth is applied to the external valuation, the stabilised yield for the 51 stores pre administration expenses is 8.4% 2010: 8.4%.
D. The future net cash flow projections including revenue growth and cost inflation have been discounted at a rate that reflects the risk associated with each asset.
The weighted average annual discount rate adopted for both freeholds and leaseholds is 11.29% 2010: 11.35%.
E. Purchasers costs of 5.8% see below have been assumed initially and sale plus purchasers costs totalling 6.8% are assumed on the notional sales in the tenth year in relation to the freehold stores.
Short leasehold The same methodology has been used as for freeholds, except that no sale of the assets in the tenth year is assumed but the discounted cash flow is extended to the expiry of the lease.
The average unexpired term of the Groups seven short leasehold properties is 16.2 years March 2010: 15.8 years.
VALUATION OF INVESTMENT PROPERTY continued Assumptions continued Investment properties under construction C&W have valued the stores in development adopting the same methodology as set out above but on the basis of the cash flow projection expected for the store at opening after allowing for the outstanding costs to take each scheme from its current state to completion and full fit out.
C&W have allowed for holding costs and construction contingency, as appropriate.
For the scheme where planning consent has not yet been granted, C&W have reflected the planning risk in their valuation.
Prudent lotting C&W have assessed the value of each property individually.
However, with regard to eight recently opened stores which are loss making or have low cash flow three wholly owned and five in the Partnership 2010: ten stores, three wholly owned and seven in the Partnership C&W have prepared their valuation on the assumption that were these properties to be brought to the market then they would be lotted or grouped for sale with other more mature assets of a similar type owned by the Company in such a manner as would most likely be adopted in the case of an actual sale of the interests valued.
This lotting assumption has been made in order to alleviate the issue of negative or low short term cash flow.
C&W have not assumed that the entire portfolio of properties owned by the Group would be sold as a single lot and the value for the whole portfolio in the context of a sale as a single lot may differ significantly from the aggregate of the individual values for each property in the portfolio, reflecting prudent lotting as described above.
Valuation assumption for purchasers costs The Groups investment property assets have been valued for the purposes of the financial statements after deducting notional purchasers cost of 5.8% of gross value, as if they were sold directly as property assets.
The valuation is an asset valuation which is entirely linked to the operating performance of the business.
They would have to be sold with the benefit of operational contracts, employment contracts and customer contracts, which would be very difficult to achieve except in a corporate structure.
This approach follows the logic of the valuation methodology in that the valuation is based on a capitalisation of the net operating income after allowing a deduction for operational cost and an allowance for central administration costs.
Sale in a corporate structure would result in a reduction in the assumed Stamp Duty Land Tax but an increase in other transaction costs reflecting additional due diligence resulting in a reduced notional purchasers cost of 2.75% of gross value.
All the significant sized transactions that have been concluded in the UK in recent years were completed in a corporate structure.
The Group therefore instructed C&W to carry out a Red Book valuation on the above basis, and this results in a higher property valuation at 31 March 2011 of 827,970,000 35,820,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements.
The valuations in Big Yellow Limited Partnership are 4,990,000 higher than the value recorded in the financial statements, of which the Groups share is 1,663,000.
The sum of these is 37,483,000 and translates to 28.5 pence per share.
We have included this revised valuation in the adjusted diluted net asset calculation see note 12.
SURPLUS LAND 000 1 April 2010 20,237 Additions 621 Write back of prior year impairment 500 Disposals 3,725 31 March 2011 17,633 The current year gain of 71,000 is comprised of a write back of a prior year impairment on a site of 500,000, offset by a loss on disposal of 429,000.
In the prior year, an impairment of 2,000,000 was made against a site in addition to 73,000 of disposal costs, giving a total income statement loss for the prior year of 2,073,000.

TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 000 000 Trade receivables 1,776 1,796 Other receivables 274 1,592 Prepayments and accrued income 9,490 7,709 11,540 11,097 Trade receivables are net of a bad debt provision of 25,000 2010: 29,000.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.
The other receivables balance has reduced since the prior year due to a deferred consideration of 1.2 million on the sale of surplus land at our site in Twickenham, which was received in October 2010.
Trade receivables The Group does not typically offer credit terms to its customers and hence the Group is not exposed to significant credit risk.
All customers are required to pay in advance of the storage period.
A late charge of 10% is applied to a customers account if they are greater than 10 days overdue in their payment.
The Group provides for receivables on a specific basis.
There is a right of lien over the customers goods, so if they have not paid within a certain time frame, we have the right to sell the items they store to recoup the debt owed by the customer.
Trade receivables that are overdue are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past default experience.
For individual storage customers, the Group does not perform credit checks, however this is mitigated by the fact that all customers are required to pay in advance, and also to pay a deposit ranging from between 1 week to 4 weeks storage income.
Before accepting a new business customer who wishes to use a number of the Groups stores, the Group uses an external credit rating to assess the potential customers credit quality and defines credit limits by customer.
There are no customers who represent more than 5 per cent of the total balance of trade receivables.
Included in the Groups trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying amount of 155,000 2010: 161,000 which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable.
The average age of these receivables is 34 days past due 2010: 36 days past due.
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables 2011 2010 000 000 1 30 days 99 98 30 60 days 33 38 60 days 23 25 Total 155 161 Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts 2011 2010 000 000 Balance at the beginning of the year 29 21 Amounts provided in year 69 109 Amounts written off as uncollectible 73 101 Balance at the end of the year 25 29 The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 31 March 31 March 2011 2010 000 000 Current Trade payables 9,885 7,425 Other payables 2,075 2,510 Accruals and deferred income 9,663 8,472 Amounts owed to associate 177 VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme 918 1,052 22,718 19,459 Non current VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme 954 1,609 The Group has financial risk management policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the credit timeframe.
The Directors consider the carrying amount of trade and other payables and accruals and deferred income approximates fair value.
See note 19 for details of VAT repayable under Capital Goods Scheme.
Included within accruals and deferred income is 1,116,000 in respect of the Long Term Bonus Performance Plan.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups VAT payable under capital goods scheme as follows: 2011 2010 Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value 000 000 000 000 VAT payable under capital goods scheme 1,872 1,791 2,661 2,490 The fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at interest rates prevailing at the year end.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 19, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings.
The Groups banking facilities require hedging of 70% of the funds drawn under the investment tranche of its core banking facility.
The Group has complied with this during the year.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risks arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, but are not employed for speculative purposes.
Significant accounting policies Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognised, in respect of each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 2 to the financial statements.
Balance sheet management The Groups Board reviews the capital structure on an ongoing basis.
As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.
The Group seeks to have a conservative gearing ratio the proportion of net debt to equity.
The Board considers at each review the appropriateness of the current ratio in light of the above.
The Board is currently satisfied with the Groups gearing ratio.
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Debt 275,000 300,000 Cash and cash equivalents 8,954 30,619 Net debt 266,046 269,381 Balance sheet equity 544,949 547,285 Net debt to equity ratio 48.8% 49.2% Debt is defined as long-term and short-term borrowings, as detailed in note 19.
Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to equity holders of the Company.
Net debt is defined as gross bank borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
93 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2011 18.
Debt management The Group borrows through a senior term loan, secured on its existing store portfolio.
Borrowings are arranged to ensure an appropriate maturity profile and to maintain short term liquidity.
Funding is arranged in the Group and in Big Yellow Limited Partnership through banks and financial institutions with whom the Group has a strong working relationship.
C. Interest rate risk management The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates.
The risk is managed by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings, by the use of interest rate swap contracts.
Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate views and defined risk appetite: ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the balance sheet or protecting interest expense through different interest rate cycles.
The Group has two interest rate derivatives in place: 120 million fixed at 2.99% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument until September 2015 and 70 million fixed at 3.93% excluding the margin on the underlying debt instrument also until September 2015.
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal amounts.
Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the fair value of issued fixed rate debt held and the cash flow exposures on the issued variable rate debt held.
The fair value of interest rate swaps at the reporting date is determined by discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the reporting date and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is disclosed below.
The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the financial year.
The interest rate swaps settle on a monthly basis.
The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is one month LIBOR.
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
The Group does not hedge account for its interest rate swaps and states them at fair value, with changes in fair value included in the income statement.
The gain in the income statement for the year of these interest rate swaps was 197,000 2010: loss of 2,430,000.
A further income statement charge arose in the prior year of 245,000 in respect of the fair value movement of derivative positions that were extended in March 2010.
The fair value of the above derivatives at 31 March 2011 was a liability of 7,783,000 2010: liability of 7,980,000.
D. Interest rate sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings, without jeopardising its flexibility.
Over the longer term, permanent changes in interest rates may have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31 March 2011, it is estimated that an increase of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have reduced the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 425,000 2010: reduced adjusted profit before tax by 550,000 and a decrease of 0.5 percentage points in interest rates would have increased the Groups adjusted profit before tax by 425,000 2010: increased adjusted profit before tax by 550,000.
There would have been no effect on amounts recognised directly in equity.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest rate swaps, at the year end.
The Groups sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the year, following the repayment of floating rate debt from cash resources.
The Board monitors closely the exposure to the floating rate element of our debt.
E. Cash management and liquidity Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which has built an appropriate liquidity risk management framework for the management of the Groups short, medium and long-term funding and liquidity management requirements.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Included in note 19 is a description of additional undrawn facilities that the Group has at its disposal to further reduce liquidity risk.
Short term money market deposits are used to manage liquidity whilst maximising the rate of return on cash resources, giving due consideration to risk.
F. Foreign currency management The Group does not have any foreign currency exposure.
G. Credit risk The credit risk management policies of the Group with respect to trade receivables are discussed in note 16.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over 30,500 customers in our wholly owned stores.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.

Fair values of financial instruments The fair values of the Groups cash and short term deposits and those of other financial assets equate to their book values.
Details of the Groups receivables at amortised cost are set out in note 16.
The amounts are presented net of provisions for doubtful receivables and allowances for impairment are made where appropriate.
Trade and other payables, including bank borrowings, are carried at amortised cost.
Finance lease liabilities are included at the fair value of their minimum lease payments.
Derivatives are carried at fair value.
For those financial instruments held at valuation, the Group has categorised them into a three level fair value hierarchy based on the priority of the inputs to the valuation technique in accordance with IFRS 7.
The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities Level 1 and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs Level 3.
If the inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the category level is based on the lowest priority level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the instrument in its entirety.
The fair values of the Groups outstanding interest rate swaps, as detailed in note 18J, have been estimated by calculating the present value of future cash flows, using appropriate market discount rates, representing Level 2 fair value measurements as defined by IFRS 7.
There are no financial instruments which have been categorised as Level 1 or Level 3.
Maturity analysis of financial liabilities The contractual maturities based on market conditions and expected yield curves prevailing at the year end date are as follows: Trade and Interest Borrowings other payables rate swaps and interest Finance leases Total 2011 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 23,189 23,189 From two to five years 482 279,566 5,959 286,007 From one to two years 954 2,682 9,980 1,987 15,603 Due after more than one year 954 3,164 289,546 31,135 324,799 Due within one year 22,718 4,444 9,980 1,987 39,129 Total 23,672 7,608 299,526 33,122 363,928 Trade and Interest Borrowings other payables rate swaps and interest Finance leases Total 2010 000 000 000 000 000 From five to twenty years 672 25,254 24,582 From two to five years 355 315,203 5,995 321,553 From one to two years 1,609 3,304 10,431 1,998 17,342 Due after more than one year 1,609 2,987 325,634 33,247 363,477 Due within one year 19,459 5,039 10,431 1,998 36,927 Total 21,068 8,026 336,065 35,245 400,404 95 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Year ended 31 March 2011 18.

The loan is due to expire on 15 September 2013.
The facility is secured on a first charge of 55 of the Groups properties and is subject to certain covenants.
The facility is divided into two tranches, Tranche A, up to a maximum of 50 million is used to finance non-stabilised properties within the Group and carries a margin of 150 bps.
Tranche B is used to finance stabilised Group properties, and carries a margin of between 112.5 bps and 150 bps dependent on the Tranche B income cover.
The Group is currently paying a margin of 112.5 bps on this Tranche.
As the properties within Tranche A stabilise, they can be transferred to Tranche B, reducing the margin payable.
The facilitys principal covenant is an income cover covenant that requires Tranche B EBITDA to be greater than 1.4 times the interest cost in Tranche B: this covenant rises to 1.5 times from September 2011.
The Group is also required to retain consolidated net assets of 250 million: and a net debt to net assets ratio of less than 1.3 to 1.
There is no loan to value covenant.
At 31 March 2011 all covenants were complied with as illustrated in the table below: Covenant 31 March 2011 Minimum income cover 1.4x 3.88x Minimum net assets 250 million 544.9 million Maximum gross loan to net assets gearing 1.3:1 0.50:1 The weighted average interest rate paid on the bank borrowings during the year was 3.6% 2010: 3.6%.
The Group has 50,000,000 in undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 March 2011 which expire between two and three years 2010: 25,000,000 expiring between three and four years.
