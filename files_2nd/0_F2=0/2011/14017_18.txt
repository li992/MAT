Segment information The Group reports its segment information as two operating Divisions according to the market segments they serve, Aerospace and Flexonics.
For management purposes, the Aerospace Division is managed as two sub-divisions, Aerostructures and Fluid Systems, in order to enhance management oversight: however, these are aggregated as one reporting segment in accordance with IFRS 8.
The Flexonics Division is managed as a single division.
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Groups accounting policies described in Note 2 and sales between segments are carried out at arms length.
Adjusted operating profit, as described in Note 9, is the key measure reported to the Groups Executive Committee for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Investment income, finance costs and tax are not allocated to segments, as this type of activity is driven by the central tax and treasury function.

The impact of the rate reduction has been reflected in the calculation of the UK deferred tax asset recognised at 31 December.
The Government has also indicated that it intends to enact a future reduction in the main tax rate of 1% down to 24% on 1 April 2013.
The future 1% main tax rate reduction is expected to result in a reduction to the value of the deferred tax asset recognised in respect of the UK operations.
As this reduction in the UK corporate tax rate has not been substantially enacted at the Balance Sheet date, this is considered a non-adjusting event in accordance with IAS 10 Events After the Reporting Period and no adjustments have been made.
The impact of this and any further reduction will be taken into account at subsequent reporting dates, once the change has been substantively enacted.
UK Corporation Tax is calculated at an effective rate of 26.5% 2010 28% of the estimated assessable profit for the year.
Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.

As noted in the OFR on pages 18 to 34, the Aerospace Division consists of 18 operations and the Flexonics Division consists of 11 operations.
Each of these operations is considered to be a separate CGU.
Goodwill has been allocated to 18 of these individual CGUs 13 in Aerospace and five in Flexonics.
The table below highlights the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the CGUs that are considered significant in comparison with the total carrying amount of goodwill.
Where the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a CGU is individually not considered significant, itis aggregated in the table below.
The carrying amount of goodwill of the aggregated Aerospace CGUs is considered significant and the recoverable amounts for these units are based principally on the same key assumptions.

The 2011 goodwill impairment review was undertaken as at 31 December 2011.
The recoverable amounts of all the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The calculations for all the CGUs use cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets and forecasts per individual unit, as approved by management for the next three years: a detailed budget covers the next financial year which is supplemented by forecasts of performance for the two years after that.
These forecasts, where appropriate, take account of the current economic environment as set out in the OFR on pages 18 to 34.
Cash flows thereafter have been extrapolated based on estimated growth rates.
These growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rates for the relevant markets.
The cash flow forecasts for each CGU have also been adjusted to reflect risks specific to each CGU.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cash flows for all CGUs is 10.7% 2010 10.4%.
This is based on the Groups weighted average pre-tax cost of capital and is the measurement used by management in assessing investment appraisals.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 75 Notes to the financial statements continued 13.
Goodwill continued The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for all Aerospace CGUs are the forecast build rates for aircraft, forecast gross margins and long-term average growth rates.
Forecast build rates for aircraft are in line with market forecasts and guidance available from manufacturers such as Boeing and Airbus.
Forecast gross margins are set individually by each CGU and reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in continuing efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
Cash flows extrapolated beyond the initial forecast period of three years are based on growth rates of 2.5% per annum which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for the aerospace market as included in market outlooks from Boeing and Airbus.
As noted in the OFR on pages 18 to 34, the business jet market remains subdued and aircraft deliveries in the business jet market declined 6% in the year.
Taking this into consideration, projections for Capo Industries and two other aggregated Aerospace CGUs, for the initial forecast period have been expanded a further two years beyond the initial forecast period of three years to reflect the medium-term plan of management to recover from this downturn in the market.
Beyond this combined five-year period, cash flows are projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7% from 2017 to 2030, in line with Boeing and Bombardier 20-year market projections, and 2.5% per annum thereafter as noted above.
Management believes that any reasonably possible change in any of the key assumptions would not cause the carrying amount of AMT, Weston, Jet Products, Sterling Machine, BWT, Bird Bellows and all other aggregated Aerospace CGUs to exceed the recoverable amount ofthose units and aggregated units, respectively.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations for Pathway which includes WahlcoMetroflex are the forecast orders and forecast gross margins.
Forecast orders are based on the orders secured and quote activity at the time of setting the budget, and also reflect past experience with the build-up of orders and quote success rates.
Forecast gross margins reflect past experience, notably the most recently achieved margins, but also factor in expected efficiency improvements to counteract inflationary increases in underlying costs.
They are also adjusted to incorporate anticipated savings from headcount reductions and other cost control measures to be implemented in light of the current economic environment.
Cash flows extrapolated beyond the initial forecast period of three years are based on growth rates of 1% per annum which does not exceed the long-term average growth rate forecasts for power generation and energy markets as noted by the International Energy Agency.
Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which Pathways recoverable amount is based would not cause Pathways carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
No significant goodwill is associated with CGUs operating in land vehicle markets.
No impairment charges were recognised in 2011.
In 2010, an impairment charge of 8.7m was recognised.

Trade and other receivables continued The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 56 days.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods of 1.3m 2010 1.3m.
In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision risk in excess of the allowance for doubtful receivables.

The maximum exposure to credit riskat the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable above.
The Group does not hold any collateral as security.
For the Company, the carrying amount of amounts due from subsidiaries approximates their fair value.

Bank overdrafts and loans continued Bank overdrafts of 0.8m 2010 0.1m are arranged at floating rates, thus exposing the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Other borrowings are mainly arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
No interest rate swaps were taken out in 2010 or 2011.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups borrowings to be as follows: Group Group Company Company Year ended Year ended Year ended Year ended 2011 2010 2011 2010 m m m m Bank overdrafts 0.8 0.1 0.4 Other loans 140.7 132.1 140.2 131.4 141.5 132.2 140.6 131.4 The fair value of Other loans has been determined by applying a make-whole calculation using the prevailing treasury bill yields plus the applicable credit spread for the Group.
The other principal features of the Groups borrowings are as follows: Bank overdrafts are repayable on demand.
The effective interest rates on bank overdrafts are determined based on appropriate LIBOR rates plus applicable margin.
The Groups and the Companys main loans are unsecured guaranteed loan notes in the US private placement market and revolving credit facilities.
Notes of $25m carry interest at the rate of 6.42% and are due for repayment in October 2015.
Notes of $75m carry interest at the rate of 6.84% and are due for repayment in October 2018.

The Group also has two revolving credit facilities.
A committed 60m five-year syndicated multi-currency facility was entered into in October 2011, replacing a 80m facility, which was due to mature in July 2012.
There were no amounts drawn by either the Group or the Company at 31 December 2011.
There were no amounts drawn byeither the Group or the Company under the 80m facility at 31 December 2010.
A committed $25m single bank 16.1m overdraft and letter of credit facility was entered into in May 2011, maturing in May 2014, replacing an existing $20m facility which matured in August 2011.
There were no loans drawn under either of these facilities at 31 December 2011 and 31December 2010.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had available 67.6m 2010 92.7m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.

Financial instruments Capital risk management The Group manages its capital structure to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern whilst maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the balance between debt and equity.
In considering the appropriate level of net debt the Group pays close attention to its level as compared to the cash generation potential of the Group, measured by adjusted profit before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA.
The Group also monitors capital on the basis of a gearing ratio.
This ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital.
Net debt is calculated as the total of bank and other loans, obligations under finance leases, forward exchange contract losses less cash and cash equivalents and forward exchange contract gains.
Total capital is the equity shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.
All of the Groups external borrowing facilities have a requirement for the ratio of net debt to EBITDA to be less than 3.0x.
Internally the Group aims for this ratio to not exceed 2.5x.
At 31 December 2011 net debt was 0.8x the Groups level of EBITDA 31 December 2010 0.7x.
In addition, all borrowing facilities contain the requirement for EBITDA interest cover the number of times net interest is covered by the Groups EBITDA to be in excess of 3.5x.
At 31 December 2011 EBITDA was 13.7x the level of net interest 31 December 2010 11.8x.
Therefore, the Group currently has considerable funding headroom.
The Groups strategy in respect of gearing is to target a long-term gearing ratio within the range of 60% to 80%.
Ratios outside this range may still be considered to be acceptable, in certain circumstances.
The gearing ratio for the Group at the end of 2011 was 34% 2010 28%.
The increase in 2011 is attributable mainly to the increase in net debt primarily as a result of the acquisition of Weston at the end of November 2011.
Financial risk management The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall treasury risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets, and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the Board, which provide written principles on foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and the investment of excess liquidity.
Compliance with policies and exposures limits is reviewed by the Groups Treasury Committee on a regular basis.
The Group does not enter into or trade financial instruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
Foreign exchange risk management The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange risk arising on the operations trading activities in foreign currencies.
Where commented on below, the sensitivity analysis of the Groups exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and left unchanged throughout the reporting period, with all other variables held constant such as interest rates.
Translation risk The Group derived 89% of its revenue from businesses outside the United Kingdom, with 66% relating to operations in North America.
Fluctuations in the value of the US dollar and other currencies in relation to the Pound Sterling have had, and may continue to have, a significant impact on the results of the Groups operations when reported in Pound Sterling.
The Group decided not to hedge this translation risk.
In addition, the majority ofassets are denominated in foreign currency, particularly in US dollars.
In order to provide a hedge against volatility in the value of these assets compared to the Groups earnings, and hence provide a natural hedge against the Groups principal lending covenant the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, the Group aims to borrow in foreign currencies in similar proportions to its generation of foreign currency EBITDA, where practical and economic.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of all other currencies against Pound Sterling would have increased or decreased 2010 Group operating profit by 8.3m 6.3m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement and would have increased or decreased net equity by 19.9m 14.8m of which would have been due to the US dollar movement.
Transaction risk The Group has a number of transaction-related foreign currency exposures, particularly between the Euro and the South African Rand, and between the US dollar and the Pound Sterling.
The Group seeks to hedge transaction-related exposures on a rolling 15- to 18-month forward basis and applies hedge accounting where the forwards can be designated in a qualifying cash flow hedge relationship.
Based on the net of the annual sales and purchase-related exposures, all transaction-related foreign currency exposures to Group profit after hedging in existence at 31December 2010 are immaterial.
The impact on net equity is determined by the unrecognised portion of open forward contracts at the year-end.
A 10% appreciation or depreciation of the Euro against the Rand and of the US dollar against Pound Sterling would have decreased or increased net equity by 0.4m and 0.7m, respectively.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 83 Notes to the financial statements continued 21.
Financial instruments continued Interest rate risk management The Group has a policy of maintaining approximately 60% of its borrowing costs at fixed interest rates.
The Group generally borrows long term in fixed rates but at times may borrow at floating rates and swap into fixed depending on credit market conditions.
Occasionally a portion of fixed debt interest is swapped into floating rates.
The combination of maintaining an acceptable balance of fixed and floating rate debt, and the Groups policy of borrowing in foreign currency in proportion to its generation of foreign currency earnings, provides an effective hedge against the impact of interest rate and foreign currency volatility on total interest costs.
The following sensitivity analysis of the Groups and the Companys exposure to interest rate risk at the reporting date has been determined based on the exposure to interest rates at the beginning of the financial year, and held constant throughout the reporting period with all other variables held constant such as foreign exchange rates.
If variable interest rates had been 0.5% lower or higher, the Groups and Companys net profit would have increased or decreased by 0.2m.
Any fixed interest debt is held to maturity and not fair value adjusted through the profit and loss.
An increase or decrease of 0.5% in the US dollar market interest rate for the fixed rate debt held up to maturity would have decreased or increased the fair value of the Groups and Companys borrowings by 3.3m.
The Groups and Companys sensitivity to interest rates has decreased during the current period mainly due to the increased proportion of fixed debt.
Credit risk management The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The credit quality of customers is assessed taking into account their financial position, past experience and other factors.
The Group is guarantor under the leases of two buildings in the UK, which arose on the disposal of former Group-owned subsidiaries in 2001 and 2004. Credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements, which is net of impairment losses, represents the Groups and Companys maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management Liquidity risk reflects the risk that the Group will have insufficient resources to meet its financial liabilities as they fall due.
The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
Cash flow forecasts are produced monthly, together with appropriate capacity planning and scenario analysis, to ensure that bank covenant and liquidity targets will be met.
The Directors also regularly assess the balance of capital and debt funding of the Group, as part of a process to satisfy the Groups long-term strategic funding requirements.
As noted in the OFR on pages 18 to 34, the Group is currently in a well-funded position, with significant headroom under its committed borrowing facilities and no major renewal of borrowing facilities due until 2014.
It is considered unlikely that the Group will face any significant funding issues in the foreseeable future.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 18.9m 2010 7.8m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 38.2m 2010 5.2m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are losses of 26.1m and 3.5m 2010 2.8m that will expire within seven years and eight years respectively 2010 eight years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 131.1m 2010 59.9m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Acquisitions Damar Machine Company On 25 March 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Damar Machine Company and two small related legal entities collectively Damar.
Damar, located in Monroe, Washington, USA, is principally a manufacturer and integrator of precision machined parts and assemblies for the commercial aircraft industry.
The business, like the Groups existing Aerospace Division, has content on each of Boeings 737, 747, 767, 777 and 787 platforms, with Boeing commercial aircraft representing some 88% of Damars 2010 revenue.
Over the past year, Boeing has announced build rate increases for all of these aircraft types.
Consequently, the future prospects for Damar, and the Groups Aerospace Division, appear highly encouraging.
Damars capabilities, combined with Seniors wider market access, financial strength and operational excellence focus, are expected to lead to stronger growth prospects and improved operational efficiencies, benefiting customers, employees and shareholders.
The cash consideration, including acquired overdraft of 0.1m, was 15.6m and the acquisition was funded from the Groups existing debt facilities.
Set out below is a summary of the net assets acquired: Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: m Identifiable intangible assets 0.6 Property, plant and equipment 2.1 Inventories 2.0 Financial assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents 1.1 Bank overdraft 0.1 Financial liabilities 1.0 Net assets acquired 4.7 Goodwill 11.1 Total consideration 15.8 Consideration satisfied by: Cash paid 15.5 Deferred consideration payable 0.3 Total consideration 15.8 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration paid to date 15.5 Plus: overdraft acquired 0.1 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition 15.6 92 Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information 33.
Acquisitions continued The goodwill of 11.1m results largely from the expectation that the Group will be able to leverage the existing business relationship the Group has with Boeing, as well as the Groups relationships with other commercial aerospace suppliers, to generate substantial, sustainable financial growth beyond what Damar would have potentially achieved as a stand-alone company.
11.1m of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for taxpurposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate mainly to customer contracts, the fair value of which is dependent on estimates of attributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are being amortised over 2.8 years.
The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a fair value of 1.0m and a gross contractual value of 1.0m, all of which is expected tobe collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.1m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2011.
Damar contributed 11.5m of external revenue and 0.1m to the Groups operating profit from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2011.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2011, Group revenue for the 12 months ending 31 December 2011 would have been 644.8m and Group operating profit would have been 83.3m.
Weston EU Limited On 25 November 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Weston EU Limited, which has a subsidiary Weston SEA Limited collectively Weston.
Weston, located in Colne, Lancashire, UK and with facilities in Chonburi, Thailand, is principally a manufacturer of precision machined parts and assemblies for the commercial aerospace industry supplying components for aircraft structures, interiors and for gas turbine engines.
Weston has content on each of the Airbus A320 family, A330, A350 and A380 platforms, with Airbus commercial aircraft representing over 70% of Westons 2011 revenue.
Over the past year, Airbus has announced build rate increases for all of these aircraft types and, consequently, the future prospects for Weston appear highly encouraging.
Westons capabilities, combined with Seniors wider market access and financial strength, are expected to further enhance the future growth prospects for the Group.
The cash consideration, net of cash acquired of 4.1m, was53.0m and the acquisition was funded from the Groups existing debt facilities.
Set out below is a provisional summary of the net assets acquired: Recognised amounts of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed: m Identifiable intangible assets 13.5 Property, plant and equipment 7.8 Inventories 6.4 Financial assets, excluding cash and cash equivalents 12.7 Cash and cash equivalents 4.1 Financial liabilities 14.9 Net assets acquired 29.6 Goodwill 27.5 Total consideration 57.1 Consideration satisfied by: Cash paid 57.1 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition: Cash consideration paid to date 57.1 Less: Cash and cash equivalents acquired 4.1 Net cash outflow arising on acquisition 53.0 The goodwill of 27.5m represents the premium paid in anticipation of future profitability from assets that are not capable of being separately identified and separately recognised such as the assembled workforce as well as the expectation that the Group will be able to leverage its wider market access and strong financial position to generate sustainable financial growth beyond what Weston would have potentially achieved as a stand-alone company.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate to customer contracts, the fair value of which is dependent on estimates ofattributable future revenues, profitability and cash flows, and are being amortised over five years.
Senior plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 93 Notes to the financial statements continued 33.
Acquisitions continued The financial assets acquired include trade receivables with a fair value of 12.1m and a gross contractual value of 12.1m, all of which is expected to be collectible.
Acquisition-related costs of 0.5m are included in administrative expenses within trading profit in the Groups Consolidated Income Statement for the year ended 31 December 2011.
The fair value of the acquired identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities is provisional pending finalisation of the fair value exercise.
Weston contributed 4.1m of external revenue and 0.3m to the Groups operating profit from the date of acquisition to 31 December 2011.
If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2011, Group revenue for the 12 months ending 31 December 2011 would have been 691.1m and Group operating profit would have been 86.1m.

The disclosures below are in respect of both Group and Company.
a 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan Equity-Settled Long Term Incentive Plans 1,782,070 shares were awarded under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan on 18 March 2011.
Awards under this plan have a three-year vesting period, subject to earnings per share EPS and total shareholder return TSR performance conditions being met.
Half the awards have an attaching performance target for EPS growth over the three-year performance period of at least 3% per annum above the RPI.
The other half of the awards begin to vest if the Companys TSR falls in the top half of a comparator group at the end of the three-year performance period.
Vesting levels increase with higher performance.
The awards are settled by delivering shares to the participants.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with EPS conditions is 126.00p per share, which is essentially the share price at the date of grant of 135.00p per share less an allowance for dividends foregone over the three-year vesting period.
The estimated fair value for the awards granted in the year with TSR conditions is 60.20p per share, reflecting an adjustment of 48% to the fair value of the awards with EPS conditions due to the stringent TSR condition.
These fair values were calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
This model incorporates a technique called bootstrapping, which models the impact of the TSR condition.
The model inputs at the date of grant were the share price of 135.00p, a risk-free interest rate of 1.7% per annum, expected volatility of 64.0% per annum, net dividend yield of 2.3% per annum, and the performance conditions as noted above.
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous three years.
The following share awards were outstanding as at 31 December 2011 and 2010: Year ended Year ended 2011 2010 Number of Number of shares shares Outstanding at 1 January 6,368,994 5,300,384 Granted 1,782,070 2,122,172 Exercised 1,256,703 810,657 Forfeited 393,507 242,905 Outstanding at 31 December 6,500,854 6,368,994 Cash-Settled Long Term Incentive Plan Under the 2005 Plan, phantom awards were granted to certain employees.
These are subject to the same general terms and conditions as the above equity-settled awards, however, on vesting the holder is entitled to receive an amount equal to the market value of the shares in relation to which the phantom award vests.
No phantom awards were awarded or vested under the 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan during the year.
The number of notional shares outstanding at 31 December 2011 and 2010 was 15,913. b Savings-Related Share Option Plan The Company operates a Savings-Related Share Option Plan for eligible employees across the Group.
There are no performance criteria for this arrangement and options are issued to all participants in accordance with the HM Revenue & Customs rules for such savings plans.
SavingsRelated Share Options were last awarded on 29 March 2011.
The estimated fair value for the award granted during the year was 51.72p.
This fair value was calculated by applying a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The model inputs at the date of the grant were the share price of 144.40p, a risk-free interest rate of 1.78% per annum, expected volatility of 58.42% per annum and a net dividend yield of 2.23%.

Retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK, North America and Europe.
These include both defined contribution arrangements and defined benefit arrangements.
The largest defined benefit arrangement for the Group and Company, the Senior plc Pension Plan, is a funded scheme in the UK, providing benefits based on final pensionable emoluments for the employees of the Group and Company.
This plan was closed to new employees from April 2008.
A change to the Rules of the Plan was implemented prior to 31 December 2009 to introduce a cap on future pensionable earnings growth of 2% per annum from 6 April 2010.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 6 April 2010 and, for the purposes of accounting under IAS 19, this valuation has been rolled forward to 31 December 2011.
In addition, the Group operates two defined benefit plans in the USA, one of which was closed to future accrual from October 2009.
Separate disclosure is made for the funded UK and US defined benefit arrangements.
In both the UK and the USA the assets of funded plans are held in separate trustee administered funds managed by independent financial institutions and have pension costs assessed by consulting actuaries using the Projected Unit Method.
The Trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
For the Senior plc Pension Plan in the UK, the Trustee is Senior Trustee Limited.
The appointment of the Directors to the Board is determined by the plans Trust documentation.
There is a policy that at least one-third of all Directors should be nominated by members of the plan.
Currently there are two member-nominated Directors and four Directors that have been nominated by the Company, of which the Chairman and one other Director are viewed as independent.
The investment strategy for the plan is decided locally by the Trustees.
The primary investment objective is for the plan to be able to meet benefit payments as they fall due.
This objective is implemented by setting strategic asset allocations using a horizon-based approach.
Under this approach, all benefit cash flows expected to fall in the next 13 years the horizon period are met by investment in low-risk assets such as fixed interest and index-linked bonds.
Cash flows after the horizon period are met by investment in more volatile assets which are expected to deliver a higher return than bonds in the longer term.
In setting this strategy, the Trustees consider a wide range of asset classes, the risk and rewards of a number of possible asset allocation options, the sustainability of each asset class within each strategy, and the need for appropriate diversification between different asset classes.
The Trustees continue to review their investment strategy and have also implemented a switching mechanism to secure any outperformance of equities relative to bonds, by selling equities to buy bonds.
The Group also has a small number of unfunded post-retirement plans, including a closed healthcare scheme in the US.
Separate disclosure is provided for these arrangements.
a Defined contribution schemes The Group has a number of different defined contribution and government-sponsored arrangements in place in the countries in which it operates.
None of these are individually material to the Group and the aggregate cost of such schemes for the period was 4.9m 2010 3.9m.

The expected rate of return on assets is calculated as a weighted average rate of return on each asset class.
Where such rates are not available in the market, the expected rate of return for each asset class is calculated by giving consideration to inflation, the risk-free rate of return based on government gilts securities, and the risk premium expected return in excess of the risk-free rate.
The market provides implied forecasts of both the inflation rate and the risk-free rate.
The risk premium is based primarily on historical data adjusted to reflect any systemic changes that have occurred in the relevant markets.
For the UK plan, the expected return on each asset class is as follows: 2011 2010 % % Equities 6.2 6.9 Bonds 4.1 4.7 Gilts 2.2 3.4 Cash 2.5 3.7 Total 4.0 5.0 For the UK plan, the estimated impact on the plan deficit at 31 December 2011 for changes in assumptions is as follows: Increase in plan deficit m 0.5% decrease in the discount rate 17.0 One-year increase in life expectancy 6.0 0.5% increase in inflation 10.0 For the UK plan, the Group has agreed with the Trustees to fund the plan deficit over a nine-year period from January 2011 to December 2019.
Theestimated amounts of contributions expected to be paid during 2012 to the UK plan is 8.1m 6.7m of which is to fund the past service deficit and to the USA funded plans is 1.0m.

Retirement benefit schemes continued g Other post-retirement liabilities This balance comprises an unfunded German pension plan 2.7m 2010 2.8m, unfunded closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the USA 0.4m 2010 0.6m and provision for post-retirement payments in France of 1.9m 2010 1.7m.
The closed pension and post-retirement healthcare plans in the US have been valued on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 4.6%, and annual healthcare cost trend rate of 10.0% until the payment for medical benefits cease in December 2014.
The effect of a1% increase or decrease in the healthcare cost trend rate is negligible to the Groups results.
The German plan has been subject to formal actuarial valuation on a Projected Unit Method with the following assumptions: discount rate 5.1%, salary growth 2.0% and inflation 2.0%.
In France, the provision arises from a legal obligation to make payments to retirees in the first two years post-retirement.
Hence, it is not subject to discounting tothe same extent as the other longer-term post-retirement liabilities.
