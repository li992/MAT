The chief operating decision-maker for the Group is considered to be the Chief Executive Officer.
The Groups operating segments have been defined as the Groups business lines, namely Private Equity, Infrastructure, Debt Management and Non-core Investments.
The business lines are determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, and investment funding model.
During the year to 31 March 2011 the Growth Capital and the Buyouts business lines were combined to form the Private Equity business line and a new business line, Debt Management, was also established.
The performance of operating segments is assessed based on the gross portfolio return, principally comprising gains and losses on investments and investment income.
Segmental assets are represented by the investment portfolio value for each business line.

Details of the performance conditions to which unvested options are subject are set out in the Directors remuneration report.

No options were exercised during the year 2010: nil.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average contractual life of 6.10 years 2010: 6.45 years.
The cost of share options is spread over the vesting period of three to five years.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 129p 2010: 124p.
These fair values were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

Expected volatility was determined using an average of the implied volatility on grant and historic share price volatility of the preceding 8.5 years.
 Performance Share awards made under the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan during the year were conditional awards of shares to executives which will be transferred to the participant by the 3i Group Employee Trust on vesting.
Awards are subject to a performance condition determining whether and to what extent the award will vest.
There are two types of awards: conditional Performance Share awards and conditional Super-performance Share awards.
The performance condition for Performance Share awards is based on the outperformance of the theoretical growth in value of a shareholding in the Company with dividends reinvested for the three year performance period from grant averaged over a 60-day period compared to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index with dividends reinvested adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings over that period.
At an outperformance level below 0% per annum no part of the award will vest.
At an outperformance level of 0% per annum, 35% of the award will vest and above 8% per annum the full award will vest.
At outperformance levels between 0% and 8%, the award will vest on a pro rata basis.
Performance Share awards made before 1 April 2007 were restricted awards which vested based on the Companys percentage rank by total shareholder return for the three years from grant averaged over a 60-day period compared to a comparator group consisting of the FTSE 100 Index constituents at the grant date adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings during the performance period.
A companys percentage rank is its rank in the comparator group divided by the number of companies in the group at the end of the performance period expressed as a percentage.
At a percentage rank below 50% no shares vested.
At a rank of 50%, 35% of the shares vest and at 75% all the shares vest.
Between these points shares vest pro rata.
Super-performance Share awards were conditional awards of shares which were subject to a particularly challenging performance condition.
The performance condition required annual percentage compound growth in the net asset value per share with dividends re-invested over the three-year period of RPI plus 10 percentage points per annum to achieve minimum vesting of 25% of the award: RPI plus 13.5 percentage points per annum to achieve 50% vesting: and RPI plus 17 percentage points per annum to achieve maximum vesting.
The performance condition was measured over a three-year period.
If the condition was satisfied, the awards remained subject to a further two-year holding period before they vested.
Super-performance Share awards made before 1 April 2007 were restricted awards which were transferred to the participants by the 3i Group Employee Trust on terms that the shares would be forfeited to the extent the performance condition was not satisfied and in certain other circumstances.
No Super-performance Share awards have been made since 2007.
DeferredShareBonus Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as a conditional award of shares under the 3i Group Deferred Bonus Plan, which vest after two years.
The awards are not subject to a performance condition.
The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at the date of the award.
DeferredShareawards Certain employees receive awards of Deferred Shares under the 3i Group Deferred Bonus Plan which vest after three years subject to continued service for that period.
These awards are not subject to a performance condition.
ShareIncentivePlan Eligible UK employees may participate in an HM Revenue and Customs approved Share Incentive Plan intended to encourage employees to invest in the Companys shares.
Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition.
During the year participants invested up to 125 per month from their pre-tax salaries in the Companys shares referred to as partnership shares.
For each share so acquired the Company grants two free additional shares referred to as matching shares which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed other than for certain permitted reasons within three years of grant.
Dividends are re-invested on behalf of participants in further shares referred to as dividend shares.
 In conjunction with the June 2009 rights issue, eligible employees could subscribe for between 5,000 and 1.5 million of ordinary shares at market price.
Employees were then granted one matching share for every two ordinary shares purchased, which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed other than for certain permitted reasons within three years of grant.
The matching shares are also subject to the condition that fully diluted NAV per share grows by 35% or more between 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2012.
EmployeeTrust The Group has established the 3i Group Employee Trust which holds shares in 3i Group plc which can be used to meet its obligations under certain share schemes.
The share schemes which use this trust are the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan and the 3i Group Deferred Bonus Plan.
The Trustee has full discretion as to the application of trust assets.
However, in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, 3i Group plc is considered the ultimate controlling party for accounting purposes and the operations of the 3i Group Employee Trust are fully consolidated by the Group.

The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group.
The employees of the Groups subsidiaries in France are members of a state-managed retirement benefit plan operated by the countrys government.
The French subsidiary is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The total expense recognised in profit or loss is 3 million 2010: 3 million, which represents the contributions payable to these plans.
There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
ii  The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK the Plan.
The Plan has not been offered to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006.
The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011, although the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals.
Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Groups defined contribution plan with effect from 6 April 2011.
The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Companys finances and are administered by the Trustees.
The last full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2007 was updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2011.
Discussions with the Trustees are under way concerning the triennial funding valuation and will be concluded by 30 September 2011.
As the fund is now closed to future accrual and it is intended to take steps to fide-risk the fund through changes to its investment policy and other measures.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows: 2011 2010 Discount rate 5.5% 5.5% Expected rate of salary increases 5.9% 6.1% Expected rate of pension increases 3.5% 3.8% Retail Price Index RPI inflation 3.4% 3.6% 1 Consumer Price Index CPI inflation 2.7% n a Expected return on the Plan assets 6.0% 6.2% 1 The UK Government announced on 8 July 2010 that it will in future use the CPI rather than the RPI for the purposes of determining statutory minimum pension increases for private sector occupational pension schemes.
The Groups current UK defined benefit pension scheme rules specify that pensions in deferment will be linked to the statutory minimum and therefore CPI.
The Group has therefore amended its assumption for increases to pensions in deferment to reflect this.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2011 and 31 March 2010 are based on 80% of the PNA00 tables allowing for improvements in line with the medium cohort projections from 2000 subject to a minimum rate of future improvement of 1.5% pa.
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2031 2010: 2030 is projected to be 34.1 2010: 34.0 years compared to 30.7 2010: 30.5 years for someone reaching 60 in 2011.
The amount recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes are as follows: 2011 2010 m m Present value of funded obligations 626 615 Fair value of the Plan assets 670 587 Retirement benefit surplus deficit in respect of the Plan 44 28 Retirement benefit deficit in respect of other defined benefit schemes 4 Included within the present value of funded obligations is 39 million 2010: 22 million in relation to the asset restriction.
The asset restriction relates to tax that would be deducted at source in respect of the plan surplus together with the surplus that arises from the present value of supplementary contributions to the Plan agreed by the Plan trustees.

The Plan assets do not include any of the Groups own equity instruments nor any property in use by the Group.
The expected rate of returns of individual categories of the Plan assets is determined by reference to individual indices.

This includes 39 million in respect of the asset restriction.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 2011 the Group will cease to make regular contributions to the Plan in the year to 31 March 2012.
The triennial actuarial funding valuation completed in September 2008 resulted in an actuarial deficit of 86 million.
The Group agreed to fund this over five years making contributions of 20 million per annum.
In addition in April 2009 the Group agreed to provide additional contributions of 25 million per annum to the Plan until 31 March 2011.
 Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service.
3i Deutschland GmbH and 3i Europe plc Spanish branch contributes to individual investment policies for its employees and has agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an employees investment policy should it arise.
The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is 10 million 2010: 10 million and the future liability calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is 14 million 2010: 14 million.
The Group has recognised cumulative actuarial losses of nil 2010: 3 million loss and 1 million 2010: 1 million in the statement of comprehensive income in respect of these schemes.
During the year assets and liabilities of the Spanish and German pension schemes were reclassified in the balance sheet from other current assets and trade and other payables respectively to be shown as a retirement benefit deficit of 4 million.
The impact as at 31 March 2010 is a 4 million increase in the retirement benefit deficit, a 5 million reduction in other current assets and a 9 million reduction in trade and other payables.

The holding period of 3is investment portfolio is on average greater than one year.
For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current.
It is not possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions to loans and receivables includes 158 million 2010: 183 million of interest received by way of loan notes.
A corresponding amount has been included in income from loans and receivables.
Other movements include foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another, and the impact of the solvent liquidation of 3iQPEP in the prior year.
Included within the statement of comprehensive income are foreign exchange losses of 135 million 2010: 359 million loss.
This includes exchange movements on non-monetary items eg equity investment portfolio and on monetary items eg non-sterling loans and borrowings.
Of this, foreign exchange losses on monetary items not measured at fair value total 41 million 2010: 105 million.

Unquoted equity investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the statement of comprehensive income: realised profits over value on disposal of investment of 104 million 2010: 163 million, dividend income of 25 million 2010: 43 million and foreign exchange losses of 28 million 2010: 64 million.
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation an explanation section.
A reasonably possible alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach adopted.
This would have a positive impact on the portfolio of 146 million 2010: 94 million or 7% 2010: 5% of total unquoted equity value.

MIM has since changed its name to 3i Debt Management Investments Limited.
The acquisition forms part of the Groups strategy to build its Debt Management business line.
The acquisition of MIM was effected by 3i Debt Management Limited 3iDM on 15 February 2011.
3iDM paid cash consideration of 18 million for 100% of the issued share capital of MIM.
The equity shares of 3iDM are owned 55% by the Group and 45% by the management team of MIM.
The Group has entered into agreements to purchase this remaining 45% of the equity of 3iDM from the management team over the next five years, with the price subject to the performance of 3iDM and its subsidiaries.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the purchase of the management teams equity holding or earn-out is reflected in two parts: 13 million deferred consideration, for the transfer of the remaining 45% of the shares held by MIM management over five years.
This has been recognised on acquisition and is carried as a liability on the Group balance sheet.
The remaining amount is contingent on the individuals remaining in employment with 3i and 3iDM raising new funds.
The amount will be determined by the performance of 3iDM during the five-year period and will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as carried interest and performance fees payable.

If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year, the contribution to the Groups revenue from continuing operations would have been 16 million and the profit from continuing operations for the Group would have been 5 million.
Transaction costs of 4 million have been charged to operating expenses in the year.
The Group also acquired equity investments in the funds managed by MIM, on which the unrealised profit on revaluation in the period to 31 March 2011 was 7 million.

References in this note to the Risk section refer only to the contents of that section and not to other information referred to from the Risk section.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to a risk assessment through an investment approval process.
The Groups Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
Capitalstructure The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, and shareholders equity.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 21 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in note 27.
Capital is managed so as to maximise long-term return to shareholders, whilst maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.

No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in a tax-efficient manner.
The Company operates so as to qualify as a UK Investment Trust for tax purposes which necessitates its investment in subsidiaries remaining below 15% of the Companys investment portfolio.
The Groups regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FSA.
The last submission to the FSA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FSAs prudential rules.
The Groups capital requirement is updated annually following approval of the Groups Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process ICAAP report by the Board of 3i Investments plc.
The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FSA and remains at a significant regulatory capital surplus.
The Groups Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.
Financialrisks Concentrationrisk The Groups exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within the investment and treasury and funding sections in the Risk section.
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in note 1, segmental analysis.
Creditrisk The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, receivables, cash and deposits.
The Groups cash and deposits are held with a variety of counterparties with circa 34% of the Groups surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds.
The balance is held on short-term deposit with 3is relationship banks.
The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual portfolio companies.
For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Groups investment.
Where the portfolio company has failed or is expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Groups policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan.
Loan impairments are made when the valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Groups loan investment.
In these cases an appropriate loan impairment is recorded to reflect the valuation shortfall.
Further information on how credit risk is managed is given in the Risk section.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

Marketrisk The valuation of the Groups investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations.
The Groups sensitivity to these items is set out below.
i Interestraterisk Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.
The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively small.
An increase of 100 basis points would lead to an approximate increase in net assets of 5 million 2010: 4 million decrease for the Group and 6 million 2010: 1 million decrease for the Company.
This increase arises principally from changes in interest receivable and payable on floating rate, short-term instruments, including cash and deposits in the current year.
In addition the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
ii Currencyrisk The Groups net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and all other currencies combined is shown in the table below.
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group and Companys net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates assuming a 5% movement in exchange rates against sterling.
The Group manages currency risk on a consolidated basis.
Further information on how currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.

The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates.
The fair value of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to profit and loss.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was 603 million 2010: nil.
Interestrateswaps The Group used interest rate swaps during the year to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its interest-bearing loans and borrowings.
No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Variable rate to fixed rate 605 Variable rate to variable rate 150 150 150 755 The Group does not trade in derivatives.
In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.

The majority of the rest of our portfolio, however, is represented by unquoted investments.
These are valued, in the vast majority of cases, with reference to market comparables, or to recent reported transactions.
As unquoted investments are not traded on an active market, as quoted investments are, the Group adjusts the estimated enterprise value by a marketability or liquidity discount.
The marketability or liquidity discount is applied to the total enterprise value and we apply a higher discount rate for investments where there are material restrictions on our ability to sell at a time of our choosing.
The table on page 131 outlines in more detail the range of valuation methodologies available to us, as well as the inputs and adjustments necessary for each.

Structural rights are instruments convertible into equity or cash at specific points in time or linked to specific events.
For example, where a majority shareholder chooses to sell, and we have a minority interest, we may have the right to a minimum return on our investment.
Debt instruments, in particular, may have structural rights.
In the valuation, it is assumed third parties, such as lenders or holders of convertible instruments, fully exercise any rights they might have, and that the value to the Group may therefore be reduced by such rights held by third parties.
The Groups own rights are valued on the basis they are exercisable on the reporting date.
Assets classified as terminal If we believe a business in which we hold an investment has more than a 50% probability of failing in the 12 months following the valuation date, we value the investment on the basis of its expected recoverable amount in the event of failure.
This would generally result in the equity and loan components of our investment being valued at nil.
