The IFRS 7 sensitivity analysis below has been prepared using the following assumptions: this analysis only takes into account commodities for which the Group has significant exposure: fixed-price sale and purchases contracts will not fluctuate with movements in commodity prices and are therefore excluded from this analysis: derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are assumed to be fully effective hedges and therefore any movements in carrying value are captured within equity and have no impact on the income statement analysis: changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments designated as fair value hedges are assumed to be fully effective with no impact on the income statement or equity: and changes in the carrying value of derivative financial instruments not in hedging relationships are assumed to impact the income statement.
In accordance with IFRS 7, the impact of commodity prices has been determined based on the balances of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2011.
This sensitivity does not represent the income statement impact that would be expected from a movement in commodity prices over the course of a period of time.
If prices for all commodities for which the Group has significant exposure had been 10% higher lower at 31 December 2011, income would have been US$194 million higher lower 2010 US$173 million higher lower and equity reserves would have been US$20 million lower higher 2010 US$3 million Effect on net Effect on lower higher as a result of changes to reserves for commodity cash flow hedges.
There would be no other material changes in reserves of the Group as Closing earnings of a equity of a at 31 December 2011 or 2010 other than those relating directly to income statement movements.

The Group uses various valuation techniques in determining the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
The following fair value hierarchy is used to categorise and disclose the Groups financial assets and liabilities held at fair value for which a valuation technique is used: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3: techniques that use inputs that have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
