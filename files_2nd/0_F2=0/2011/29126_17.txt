Pension Scheme The companys defined benefit pension scheme based on final salary is closed to new entrants.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company.
The scheme is under the control of trustees and is administered by Punter Southall & Co, consulting actuaries.
Actuarial valuations are obtained triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out in 2010 by Punter Southall & Co which disclosed a scheme deficit of 2,513,000 on 31 July 2010.
The company has agreed to meet this deficit over nine years by equal instalments.
It should be noted that this deficit differs from that disclosed by Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS17 which is set out below and which is the liability required to be shown in the financial statements.
The main reason for the difference is that FRS17 requires future liabilities to be calculated actuarially using a rate of return based on the yield from investment grade corporate bonds which is lower than the expected rate of return on the equities in which the scheme is invested.
The FRS17 liability is separately disclosed in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefits scheme the amounts charged against revenue, as part of staff costs, are the actuarial estimation of current service costs that is, the increase in scheme liabilities arising from employee service for the current accounting period and gains and losses from settlements whereby the company is relieved of a pension obligation and from curtailments whereby the estimated years of future service are reduced in the period.
The cost of past service benefits which have vested are charged against revenue as they arise.
Where such benefits have not vested, costs are accrued until vesting occurs.
For employees who are not members of the defined benefits scheme, the company operates a defined contribution scheme under which the company has agreed to pay contributions as a percentage of salary, but has no obligation to pay further contributions.
For this scheme, the amount charged to revenue is the contributions payable for the year.
The following statement has been prepared for the defined benefits scheme in accordance with the requirements of FRS17, the purpose of which is to ensure that: 1. the companys financial statements show the assets of the scheme at fair value, and the liabilities arising from its obligations to employees on their retirement, actuarially estimated as prescribed by FRS17: 2. the operating costs of providing retirement benefits to employees, actuarially estimated, are charged against the profits of the years in which employees earn those benefits: and 3. the financial statements adequately disclose the cost of providing retirement benefits and the related gains, losses, assets and liabilities.

2011 2010 000 000 Return on ordinary activities before tax 1,485 92,430 Corporation tax at 26.83% 2010: 28% 398 25,881 Effects of: Non-taxable capital returns 3,816 22,017 Finance costs and expenses charged to capital 1,350 1,390 Non-taxable dividends 2,699 2,319 Non-taxable scrip dividends 26 19 Unutilised expenses 139 136 Overseas tax 1,341 1,334 1,341 1,334 There are unrelieved management expenses at 31 October 2011 of 76,409,000 2010: 66,764,000 but the related deferred tax asset has not been recognised.
This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable profits in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing unrelieved expenses.
Dividends 2011 2010 000 000 Dividends paid on shares recognised in the year: Previous year final of 5.60p per share 2009: 5.15p 6,497 6,391 Interim of 4.60p per share 2010: 4.45p 5,273 5,359 11,770 11,750 Dividends paid take into account share buybacks between the ex-dividend and payment dates.

Financial Instruments Summary of financial assets and financial liabilities by category The companys financial assets and financial liabilities at the balance sheet date are as follows.
The accounting policies on page 28 explain how the various categories of financial instrument are measured.
2011 2010 000 000 Financial assets Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss Fixed asset investments designated as such on initial recognition 544,542 690,327 Current assets: Debtors 1,969 6,888 Cash, short-term deposits and current asset investments 163,162 53,729 165,131 60,617 709,673 750,944 Financial liabilities Creditors: liabilities falling due within one year Purchases awaiting settlement 10,194 Other creditors 701 610 Creditors: liabilities falling due after more than one year Long-term borrowings at par 107,853 107,733 Pension liability 2,249 2,040 110,803 120,577 Report & Accounts 2011 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC 37 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2011 17.
Financial Instruments continued Risk management policies and procedures As an investment trust, the company invests in equities and other investments for the long term so as to secure its investment objectives stated on page 1.
In pursuing its investment objective, the company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the companys net assets and a reduction in the profits available for dividend.
The main risks include investment and market price risk comprising foreign currency risk and interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The directors approach to the management of these risks is set out below.
The directors, the manager and the company secretary coordinate the companys risk management.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks, and the methods used to measure the risks, which are set out below, have not changed from those applied in the previous year.
Investment and market price risk The holding of securities and investing activities involve certain inherent risks.
Events may occur which affect the value of investments.
The company holds a portfolio which is well diversified across industrial and geographical areas to help minimise these risks.
It may also use derivatives.
From time to time, the company may wish to use such instruments in order to protect against a specific risk or to facilitate a change in investment strategy such as the movement of funds from one area to another.
No such transaction may take place without the prior authorisation of the board.
Foreign currency risk Approximately 70% of the companys assets are invested overseas which gives rise to a currency risk.
From time to time, specific hedging transactions are undertaken.
The companys overseas income is subject to currency movements.
During the year, US dollar and euro dividend income was hedged by forward sales of US dollars and euros.
The currency profile of the companys monetary assets and liabilities is set out in Notes 8 and 12.
Management of the risk The manager monitors the companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis, and reports to the board at regular intervals.
The manager measures the risk to the company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
Foreign currency borrowings and forward currency contracts may be used to limit the companys exposure to anticipated future changes in exchange rates which might otherwise adversely affect the value of the portfolio of investments or the income received from them.
These borrowings and contracts are limited to currencies and amounts commensurate with the asset exposure to those currencies.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is receivable and its receipt.
38 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2011 17.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency exposure The fair values of the companys monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at 31 October 2011 and 31 October 2010 are shown below.
The companys equity and fixed interest investments which are priced in a foreign currency have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
US $ Euro Other 2011 000 000 000 Debtors dividends receivable and accrued income 344 297 601 Cash and current asset investments 18,849 33 42,219 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 19,193 330 42,820 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 203,062 44,601 170,535 Fixed interest investments at fair value through profit and loss 2,527 Total net foreign currency exposure 224,782 44,931 213,355 2010 Debtors amounts due from brokers, dividends receivable and accrued income 268 2,302 3,750 Cash 4,007 50 14,655 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 4,275 2,352 18,405 Equity investments at fair value through profit and loss 172,542 70,931 258,873 Fixed interest investments at fair value through profit and loss 5,158 3,710 Total net foreign currency exposure 181,975 76,993 277,278 The above year end amounts are not representative of the exposure to risk during the year, because the levels of monetary foreign currency exposure may change significantly throughout the year.
The maximum and minimum net monetary assets liabilities amounts for each currency were as follows.
US $ Euro Other Year to 31 October 2011 000 000 000 Maximum 36,179 6,072 49,542 Minimum 558 10 17,192 Year to 31 October 2010 Maximum 49,502 15,175 23,395 Minimum 259 141 1,205 Report & Accounts 2011 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC 39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2011 17.
Financial Instruments continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the total return for the year and the shareholders funds in regard to the companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
It assumes a 10% depreciation of sterling against both the US dollar and the euro at 31 October 2011.
These percentages have been determined based on the average market volatility in exchange rates in the previous twelve months.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the companys monetary foreign currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date.
2011 2010 US $ Euro US $ Euro 000 000 000 000 If sterling had weakened by 10% against the currencies shown, this would have had the following effect: Income statement return on ordinary activities after taxation: Revenue return 261 532 323 318 Capital return 22,478 4,493 17,796 7,475 Return attributable to shareholders 22,739 5,025 18,119 7,793 A 10% strengthening of sterling against the above currencies would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
In the opinion of the directors, the above sensitivity analyses are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative years.
c. Interest rate risk The company finances its operations through a combination of investment realisations, retained revenue reserves, bank credit facilities, debenture stocks and secured bonds.
All debenture stocks and secured bonds are at fixed rates.
The company has undrawn short-term multicurrency credit facilities which can be drawn at variable rates of interest.
Details of interest rates on financial assets are included in Note 8.
Details of interest rates on financial liabilities are included in Note 12.
Management of the risk The company finances part of its activities through borrowings at levels which have been approved and are monitored by the board.
The company, generally, does not, otherwise than in exceptional market conditions, hold substantial cash balances.
Interest rate exposure The exposure, at the year end, of financial assets and financial liabilities to interest rate risk is shown by reference to floating interest rates.
2011 2010 Within More than Within More than one year one year Total one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash 18,516 18,516 19,729 19,729 Exposure to fixed interest rates Fixed interest investments 2,988 2,988 7,094 2,257 9,351 Current asset investments 65,768 65,768 Short-term deposits 78,878 78,878 34,000 34,000 Long-term borrowings 107,853 107,853 107,733 107,733 Total exposure 166,150 107,853 58,297 60,823 105,476 44,653 40 The Scottish Investment Trust PLC Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the Financial Statements continued for the year to 31 October 2011 17.
Financial Instruments continued Interest rate sensitivity If interest rates had decreased by 5%, with all other variables held constant, the return attributable to shareholders as shown on the Income Statement would have decreased by the amounts shown in the table below: 2011 2010 000 000 Return attributable to shareholders 17 7 A 5% increase in interest rates would result in an equal and opposite effect on the above amounts.
d. Liquidity risk Almost all of the companys assets comprise listed securities which represent a ready source of funds.
In addition the company has access to short-term borrowing facilities.
The maturity profile of the companys borrowings is included in Note 12.
Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not as significant as the other risks as most of the companys assets are investments in quoted equities and are readily realisable.
The manager reviews the liquidity of the portfolio when making investment decisions.
e. Credit risk The failure of the counterparty to a transaction to discharge its obligations under that transaction could result in the company suffering a loss.
Credit risk exposure The amounts shown in the balance sheet under debtors and cash and deposits represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year ends.
Cash comprises balances held by banks with a satisfactory credit rating 2010: same.
Management of the risk This risk is managed as follows: by only dealing with brokers and banks which have been approved by the directors and which have high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies: and by setting limits on the maximum exposure to any one counterparty at any time, which are reviewed semi-annually at meetings of the audit committee.
f. Capital management policies and procedures The company carries on its business as a global growth investment trust.
Its objective is to provide investors, over the longer term, with above-average returns through a diversified portfolio of international equities and to achieve dividend growth ahead of UK inflation.
The levels of effective equity gearing and gross gearing are monitored closely by the board and manager.
The company applies a ceiling on effective equity gearing of 120%.
While effective equity gearing will be employed in a typical range of 100% to 120%, the company retains the ability to lower equity exposure below 100% if deemed appropriate.
The board, with the assistance of the manager, monitors and reviews the structure of the companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This review includes the planned level of gearing which will take into account the managers view on the market, the need to buy back shares for cancellation and the extent to which revenue to be distributed should be retained.
The companys objectives, policies and processes for managing capital are unchanged from the previous year.

Financial Instruments continued Fair value measurements recognised in the balance sheet The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities: Level 2 fair measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly: and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques not based on observable market data.
2011 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Total 000 000 000 000 Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss 536,422 8,120 544,542 There were no transfers between Level 1 & 2 during the year 2010: same.
There were two transfers between Level 2 & 3 during the year.
These changes were attributable to changes in the observability of market data 2010: none.
