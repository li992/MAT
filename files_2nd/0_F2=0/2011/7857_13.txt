Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1AccountingPolicies General Imagination Technologies Group plc is a company incorporated in the UK.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
Significant accounting policies Statement of compliance The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 78 to 81.
Basis of preparation The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
The following new standards and amendments to standards as adopted by the European Union at 30 April 2011 are mandatory for the first time for the financial year beginning 1 May 2010: Amendment to IFRS 2 Share based payments group cash-settled share-based payment transactions IFRS 3 revised Business combinations IAS 27 revised Consolidated and separate financial statements Improvements to IFRSs April 2009 Amendment to IAS 39 Financial instruments: recognition and measurement on eligible hedged items IFRS 3 now requires that acquisition expenses are charged to the Group income statement note 25 and that adjustments to contingent consideration are recognized in the Group income statement.
With this exception, these accounting standards, amendments and interpretations have had no material effect on the results or financial position of the Group disclosed within these financial statements.
Judgements made by the Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed below under Significant accounting judgements and estimates.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the trade investments have been stated at fair value in accordance with IAS 39.
Going concern After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.
The Group has adequate financial resources together with long term contracts with a number of customers and suppliers across a range of consumer market segments and geographic areas.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Further information regarding the Groups business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position is set out in the Chief Executives Review on pages 3 to 9.
Further information regarding the financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in notes 14 and 16.
In addition, note 21 to the financial statements includes: the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial risk management objectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
53 Business Combinations The Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008 in accounting for business combinations.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control passes.
The Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration paid or payable less the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities assumed and contingent liabilities acquired, all measured as of the acquisition date.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognized in the income statement.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
See note 25 for the application of the policy to the business combinations that occurred during the period.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognized in the income statement.
When share-based payment awards replacement awards are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquirees employees acquirees awards and relate to past services, then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer's replacement awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred in the business combination.
The determination is based on the market-based value of the replacement awards compared with the market-based value of the acquiree's awards and the extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and or future services.
Revenue Revenue comprises: 1 the value of consideration received in return for license fees, development income, maintenance and royalties from license and development agreements: 2 revenues from the sale of products and services to support technology licensees: and 3 revenues from the sale of systems products utilising the Groups technology to third parties.
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue from licences is recognized on delivery to the customer.
Revenue on license agreements for products which are either not finished or which need to be modified to meet specific customer requirements is recognized on a  basis over the period from starting development of the product to delivery.
The  is measured by monitoring progress compared with the total estimated project requirement.
Progress is measured by an assessment of performance against key development milestones.
Revenue associated with rights in license agreements to unspecified current and future products is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement.
Revenue on development work is recognized on a  basis over the period from the start of the development to delivery.
Development work is normally invoiced as milestones are achieved.
Where invoicing milestones on licence or development arrangements are such that the proportion of work performed is greater than the proportion of the total contract value which has been invoiced, the Group evaluates whether it has obtained, through its performance to date, the right to the uninvoiced consideration and therefore whether revenue should be recognized.
In particular it considers whether there is sufficient certainty that the invoice milestones will be achieved in the expected timeframe, that the customer considers that the Groups contractual obligations have been, or will be, fulfilled and that only those costs budgeted to be incurred will be incurred.
Where the Group considers that there is insufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group, taking into account these criteria, revenue is not recognized until there is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow into the Group.
Revenue for maintenance is recognized on a straight-line basis over the period for which maintenance is contractually agreed with the licensee.
The excess of licence fees, development income and maintenance invoiced over revenue recognized is recorded as deferred income.
Royalty revenues are earned on the sale by licensees of products containing the Groups technology.
Revenues are recognized as they are earned to the extent that the Group has sufficient evidence of sales of products containing the Groups technology by licensees.
Revenues from the sale of products to support technology licensees and systems products utilising the Groups technology to third parties are recognized upon delivery and are accounted for net of VAT, discounts and returns.
Returns are recognized at the point at which the Group has adequate knowledge that products are likely to be returned by a customer.
54 Research and development costs Costs of basic and applied research are written off in the period in which they are incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalized where it relates to a specific project where technical and commercial feasibility has been established, adequate technical, financial and other resources exist to complete the project, the expenditure attributable to the project can be measured reliably and future economic benefits are probable.
In this case, it is recognized as an intangible asset and amortized over its useful economic life.
All other development expenditure is recognized as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred after the establishment of technical feasibility and overall project and commercial profitability have not been significant and, therefore, no costs have been capitalized to date.
Operating leases Rental charges in respect of operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Employee benefits The Group contributes to a defined contribution pension plan.
Payments are charged to the income statement in the period to which they relate.
Share-based payment transactions The share option programmes and the Share Incentive arrangements allow Group employees to acquire shares of the Company.
The fair value of Share Incentives is recognized as an expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the Share Incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives granted is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of Share Incentives that vest except where forfeiture is due only to market-based performance conditions not meeting the threshold for vesting.
For the Share Appreciation Rights, cash bonuses are calculated by reference to the value of shares.
The fair value of these bonuses is recognized as an expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities over the period in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment.
The liability is remeasured at each reporting date and at settlement date.
Any changes in the fair value of the liability are recognized as personnel expense in the income statement.
Transactions of the Group-sponsored Employee Benefit Trust are included in the Groups consolidated financial statements.
In particular, the trusts purchase of shares in the Company is debited directly in equity to retained earnings.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognized in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognized directly in equity, in which case it is recognized in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method on any temporary differences between the carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes and those for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: goodwill not deductible for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilized.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer possible that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Foreign exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the rates of exchange ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange gains and losses are taken to the income statement.
On consolidation, results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.
The assets and liabilities are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising from retranslation have been recognized directly in the translation reserve within equity.
This reserve was set to zero at 1st April 2004.
Segment reporting An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Groups other components.
All operating segments operating results are reviewed regularly by the board of directors to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
55 Intangible assets Software, trademarks and patents are capitalized as intangible assets at cost of acquisition and amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, between 3 and 5 years.
The residual values of intangible assets are assumed to be nil.
Useful economic lives are reviewed on an annual basis.
When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill.
Fair value of the intangible assets is assessed assuming a hypothetical market.
The Group utilizes the income based approach when reliable future cash flows are available.
Alternatively, the cost approach or market approach are utilized.
Trade investments Trade investments are classed as available for sale and are stated on the balance sheet at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss being recognized directly in equity in the revaluation reserve, except for impairment losses.
When these investments are derecognized, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized directly in equity is recognized in profit or loss.
The fair value of unquoted investments is made by reference to recent funding rounds or, in the absence of the former, to a discounted cash-flow forecast.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid or payable over the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions is capitalized.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units expected to benefit from the acquisition and is not amortised but tested annually for impairment.
Any impairment is recognized immediately in the income statement and may not be subsequently reversed.
Impairment testing is based on assets grouped at the lowest possible level at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
On disposal of a subsidiary or business, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill is stated on the balance sheet at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Business combinations that took place prior to 1st April 2004 have not been re-stated and goodwill represents the amount recognized under the Groups previous accounting framework.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Property, plant and equipment are depreciated to write down their cost using the straight line method to their estimated residual values over the period of their estimated useful economic lives.
Periodic reviews are made of estimated remaining useful economic lives and residual values, and the depreciation rates applied are: Freehold land No depreciation Freehold buildings 2 per cent on cost Leasehold improvements Equally over the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10 per cent to 33 per cent on cost Motor vehicles 25 per cent on cost Impairment Non-financial assets Goodwill has an indefinite useful life, is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
If any such condition exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, estimates are made of the cashflows of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell, and value in use.
In assessing value in use, estimated future cashflows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate appropriate to the specific asset or cash generating unit.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying value of the asset or cash generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognized immediately in the income statement.
In respect of assets other than goodwill, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed.
56 Financial assets A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
An impairment loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset is calculated by reference to its current fair value.
Individually significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual basis.
The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognized in the income statement.
Any cumulative gain or loss in respect of an available-for-sale financial asset recognized previously in equity is transferred to the income statement.
An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost and available-for-sale financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognized in profit or loss.
For available-for-sale financial assets that are equity securities, the reversal is recognized directly in equity.
Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventory is calculated using the FIFO method.
Finished goods include direct costs and attributable overheads based on the normal level of activity.
Cash and equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of less than or equal to three months.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the statement of cash flows.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are initially measured at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Long Term Borrowing Long term borrowings are recognized initially at fair value less attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, long term borrowings are stated at amortized cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognized in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Leases Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Significant accounting judgements and estimates In applying the Groups accounting policies described above, management has made the following judgements and estimates that have a significant impact on the amounts recognized in the financial statements: Revenue Recognition The Group has made estimates on the  for licensing and development work which affect the amount of revenue recognized in the period.
These estimates involve the Group assessing the estimated resource and time required to complete development projects.
Share based payments The fair value of the Share Incentives is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the incentives.
The fair value of the Share Incentives is measured using the Black-Scholes or Monte Carlo Simulation models which take into account the terms and conditions upon which the award was made.
In determining the appropriate expense, the Group has made estimates on the likelihood that internal performance targets will be achieved and on the number of employees that will be employed on vesting.
Details of share-based payments and the assumptions applied are disclosed in note 23.
Taxation A deferred tax asset is recognized only to the extent that it is probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to utilize the temporary difference.
The Group has made estimates on the likelihood that future taxable profit will utilize these tax losses.
Impairment of Goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at a minimum on an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash generating unit that holds the goodwill at a determined discount rate and an appropriate growth rate to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
Details of assumptions used are set out in note 9.
Valuation of acquired Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognized separately from goodwill.
If such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable 57 future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over the estimated life of the asset, or where future cashflows are less certain, by discounting the cost of replicating such intangible asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Investments The Group has stated trade investments at fair value.
Further details of these investments and the valuation basis are detailed in note 11 and note 21.
Adopted IFRS not yet applied The following accounting standards, amendments and interpretations had been issued but they are not yet effective for the Group and have not been early adopted.
Their adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements unless otherwise indicated: Improvements to IFRSs effective for various dates, the earliest being annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Revised IAS 24 Related party disclosures effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 Amendment to IFRIC 14 Prepayment of a minimum funding requirement effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011 2SegmentReporting The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally to the Board of Directors, which is the Groups chief operating decision maker.
The Group is organized into two operating divisions which offer different services to different industries and are managed separately: the Technology business and the PURE Digital business.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs which are not controlled by the operating divisions are allocated to these divisions.
These divisions are the operating segments that are reported to the chief operating decision maker and are the Groups reportable segments.
There is no inter-segment trading and no significant seasonality in the Groups operations.
Principal activities are as follows: Technology business the development of embedded graphics, video, display and multi-threaded processor and multi-standard broadcast receiver and connectivity technologies for licensing to semiconductor companies for incorporation into silicon devices.
PURE Digital business the development and marketing of consumer products to showcase the technologies of the Technology business and to develop new and emerging markets for such technologies.
Information regarding the operations of each reportable segment is included below.
Performance is measured based on operating profit.

The element of the deferred tax asset related to sharebased payments arises from the potential future tax benefit on the exercise of incentives.
A deferred tax liability of 4,651,000 arose on intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisitions of Caustic Graphics, Inc. and HelloSoft Inc.
This deferred tax liability will reduce as the intangible asset is amortised over its useful life with the balance remaining at year end set out above.
Further details on the acquisitions are set out in note 25.
61 2011 2010 000 000 Deferred taxation has been presented on the balance sheet as follows: Deferred tax asset 24,868 11,018 Deferred tax liability 4,339 At end of the period 20,529 11,018 Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle the balance net.
The major components of deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year-end without taking into consideration the offsetting of balances within the same tax jurisdiction are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Recognized deferred tax assets liabilities Tax losses 11,390 6,987 Share-based payments 14,532 1,195 Capital allowances 1,067 2,788 Other timing differences 13 48 Acquisition of Intangibles 4,339 20,529 11,018 2011 2010 000 000 Unrecognized deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognized in respect of the following items reported at the applicable tax rate : Tax losses 9,293 13,208 9,293 13,208 The balance of 9,293,000 relates to losses in the US 2010: 1,993,000 which expire progressively over the next 15 years.
Of the balance, 8,321,879 2010: Nil relates to losses brought over from the acquisitions see note 25.
These are available for utilization against profit arising in the US in future periods.
None of the losses in the current year balance relate to the UK 2010: 11,215,000.

Details of the schemes considered in arriving at the potentially dilutive ordinary shares are set out in note 23.
During the period the Group tested its balance of goodwill for impairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment of assets.
The test was based on a calculation of the recoverable amount based on value in use, using projected cash flows for the Technology business.
63 The key assumptions in the value in use calculations were: Period over which the Directors have projected cashflows a five year forecast period is used which is based on management forecasts of future profits, with an assumed terminal growth rate after 2015 of 2.5% per annum 2010: 2.5%.
The terminal growth rate is assessed taking into account general economic conditions.
Forecast revenue growth the revenue projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Forecast operating margins the operating margin projections are consistent with those used by the Group for financial planning purposes.
Discount rate future cash flows are discounted at a rate of 15% which represents a pre tax rate that reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the Technology business 2010: 15%.
The Directors do not believe that any reasonably foreseeable changes to key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill, such is the margin by which the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value.

 Overview The Group has exposure to the following risks from its use of financial instruments: Market risk Credit risk Liquidity risk This note presents information about the Groups exposure to each of the above risks, the Groups objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Groups risk management framework.
Categories of financial instruments Details of the significant accounting policies and methods adopted, including the criteria for recognition, the basis of measurement and the basis on which income and expenses are recognized in respect of each class of financial assets, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed in note 1 to the Financial Statements.
2011 2010 Notes 000 000 Financial assets Loans and receivables Trade and other receivables 13 13,287 7,289 Loans 13 795 Cash and cash equivalents 14 49,374 29,367 Available for sale investments 11 5,717 4,550 Total financial assets 68,378 42,001 2011 2010 Notes 000 000 Financial liabilities Bank loan 16 5,587 431 Trade and other payables 15 5,239 3,832 Total financial liabilities 10,826 4,263 68 Market Risk Market risk is the risk that changes in the market prices, such as foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, will affect the Groups income or the value of its holdings of financial instruments.
The objective of market risk is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, whilst optimizing the return on risk.
a Foreign currency risk The Group transacts licence and development agreements with customers and purchases of products for PURE primarily in US dollars and, therefore, the Groups earnings are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group reviews its foreign exchange exposure on a regular basis and, if there is a material exposure to exchange rate fluctuations and the Board considers it appropriate, the Group will reduce the risk by currency hedging on net receivable payable balances.
Forward contracts will be entered into with the objective of matching their maturity with currency receipt.
During the period and as at 30 April 2011 and 30 April 2010 there were no outstanding currency contracts.
The most important foreign currency to the Group is the US Dollar.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis The Group transacts a large proportion of its revenues and costs in US Dollars.
Taking all income and expenditure in US Dollars into account, management have appraised that for the financial year to 30 April 2011, each additional one cent increase or decrease in the US Dollar exchange rate against Sterling would have decreased or increased revenues by circa 446,000 2010: 314,000 and profit by circa 262,000 2010: 21,000. b Interest rate risk The Groups earnings may be affected by changes in interest rates available on bank deposits.
The Group aims to maximize returns from funds held on deposit and uses market deposits with major clearing banks accordingly.
With the current level of bank deposits, the impact of a change in interest rates is not considered material.
69 In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their average effective interest rate at the reporting date and the periods in which they mature or, if earlier, reprice.
The fixed rate cash deposits were placed with banks throughout the year and earned interest of between 0.1% and 0.6%.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on LIBID equivalents.
Short term receivables and payables are not interest bearing with the exception of the short term element of the long term loan.
The Group has two long term loans.
The existing loan with a balance of 372,000 is repayable over 8 years and incurs interest at a rate of 2.0% over base rate.
A new loan for 5,215,000 was taken out during the year.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis In the financial year to 30 April 2011, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been increased by circa 364,000 2010: 256,000.
Similarly, if interest rates had been 100 basis points lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups profit would have been decreased by circa 126,000 2010: 45,000. Credit Risk Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Groups receivables from customers and investment of liquid funds.
The Group limits its exposure to credit risk by only investing in liquid securities and only with counter parties that have a high credit rating.
Capital Risk The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximizing the return to stakeholders as well as sustaining the future development of the business.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issued new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from the previous financial year.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 16, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in note 17.
The CFO regularly monitors the capital risk on behalf of the board.
70 Trade Receivables The exposure to credit risk is mitigated by selling to a diverse range of customers.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers prior to sales taking place.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk either by customer or by geography.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2011 2011 2010 2010 Ageing of trade receivables: 000 000 000 000 Not past due 10,072 6,040 Past due 0-90 days 2,216 844 Past due greater than 90 days 902 125 90 50 13,190 125 6,974 50 Trade receivables that are less than three months overdue are generally not considered impaired.
Receivables more than three months overdue are considered on a line by line basis and a provision is made where recovery is considered doubtful.
No other financial assets are past due.
Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due.
To minimize this risk the Group only invests funds in liquid securities.
As a contingency, the Group maintains a 5 million overdraft facility.
The following table is drawn up based on undiscounted contractual maturities including both interest and principal cashflows.

Available for sale investments Fair Value Hierarchy The Group measures the fair value of available for sale investments using the following hierarchy that reflects the significance of the inputs used in making the measurement: Level 1: Quoted market price unadjusted in an active market for an identical financial instrument.
Level 2: Valuation techniques based on observable inputs, such as market prices for similar financial instruments.
Level 3: Valuation techniques using unobservable inputs which can have a significant effect on the instruments valuation.
The Group has applied the above hierarchy to its investments as follows: Toumaz Holdings - the valuation is based on the quoted share price for Toumaz Holdings on AIM.
This investment is categorised as Level 1.
Frontier Silicon the valuation of the equity holding in Frontier is based on a discounted cashflow with assumptions made on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
The fair value of the loan note in Frontier is assessed to approximate to book value.
This investment is categorised as Level 3.
GreenPlug the valuation is based on the most recent funding round which is estimated to approximate to the fair value as at the reporting date.
Audiboo the valuation of the equity holding in Audioboo is based on the most recent funding round which is estimated to approximate to the fair value as at the reporting date.
The fair value of the convertible loan note in Audioboo is assessed to approximate to book value This investment is categorised as Level 3.
Blu-Wireless the valuation is based on the most recent funding round which is estimated to approximate to the fair value as at the reporting date.
The following table analyses investments, measured at fair value at the reporting date, by the level in the fair value hierarchy into which the fair value measurement is categorised: 2011 2010 000 000 Level 1 2,459 2,591 Level 2 Level 3 3,258 1,959 5,717 4,550 72 The following table shows a reconciliation from opening balances to the closing balances for fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy: 000 As at 30 April 2010 1,959 Investment in the year 672 Reclassification 795 Total gains and losses: In income statement In other comprehensive income 168 As at 30 April 2011 3,258 Although the Group believes that its estimates of fair value are appropriate, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could lead to different measurements of fair value.
With respect to fair value measurements in Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the valuation of Frontier Silicon would not be impacted by making reasonable changes to the assumptions on the forecast cashflows, the annual terminal growth rate and the discount rate.
The valuation of the GreenPlug is based on a funding round carried out in February 2011 and in the short intervening period the value is not viewed to be materially different.
Any change in the valuation of GreenPlug would have a commensurate change in the value of the Groups holding.
Loan Note The Loan Note in Frontier Silicon is non-interest bearing.
The time period for redemption of the Loan Note is subject to the discretion of Frontier Silicon, Loan Note holders or a sale or listing and therefore is undetermined.
Fair value is therefore assessed to approximate to book value.
The Convertible Loan Note in Audioboo is non-interest bearing.
The time period for conversion of the Convertible Loan Note is subject to the discretion of the Group.
Fair value is assessed to approximate to book value.
Long term borrowings The fair value approximates to book value as this instrument is at a variable interest rate.
 The Group had no contingent liabilities at 30 April 2011 or 30 April 2010.
23EmployeeBenefits Pension The Group participates in a number of defined contribution pension plans in the UK.
The assets of the schemes are held separately in independently administered funds.
There were no outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date.

Caustic Graphics Inc. On 17th December 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Caustic Graphics Inc. Caustic, a company based in U. S. which has developed unique and patented hardware and software ray-tracing technologies.
Ray-tracing is a technique used for rendering three-dimensional graphics with complex and more natural lighting models to achieve cinema-quality 3D and a level of near photographic realism that is impractical with traditional 3D graphics techniques.
Caustic technology lowers the cost and significantly increases the efficiency and performance of ray-tracing.
Details of the fair value of net assets acquired for Caustic are set out below: Fair value to Group on acquisition 000 Property, plant and equipment 30 Goodwill 14,066 Intangible assets - developed technology 4,662 Trade and other receivables 27 Trade and other payables 414 Deferred tax liability 1,632 Net assets acquired 16,739 Consideration transferred net of 363,000 of cash acquired 16,739 Total consideration 16,739 The goodwill of 14,066,000 represents the benefits that the Group expects to gain from combining Caustics technology with the Groups existing market leading graphics technologies and promoting such combinations to its mainstream graphics markets across mobile, embedded, console and computing segments.
The other intangible asset of 4,662,000 represents the value placed on Caustic technology and the deferred tax thereon was 1,632,000.

Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included in the consolidated accounts which it has prepared.

Share based payment The fair value of options granted is recognized as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options.
The fair value of the options granted is measured using an option pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The amount recognized as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
