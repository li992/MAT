com Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1 Corporate information The Consolidated Financial Statements of Moneysupermarket.
com Group PLC Company, a company incorporated in England, and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2011 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Directors on 27 February 2012.
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU Adopted IFRSs.
The Company has elected to prepare its Company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 69 to 72.
2 Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The Financial Statements are prepared on the historical cost basis.
Comparative figures presented in the Financial Statements represent the year ended 31 December 2010.
The Financial Statements are prepared on a going concern basis, which the Directors deem appropriate, given the Groups positive cash position and lack of debt.
Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of Financial Statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The most significant areas of estimation uncertainty, and areas where critical judgements are made in applying accounting policies that have a material effect on the Financial Statements, are listed below.
The uncertainties encountered, and judgements made, are described in more detail in the relevant accounting policies and accompanying notes: Note 3 acquisitions Note 12 goodwill and other intangibles, including their amortisation and impairment Note 13 revenue recognition Note 13 provision for doubtful debts Note 14 accruals Note 18 share-based payments Note 21 commitments and contingencies Basis of consolidation These Consolidated Financial Statements incorporate the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Significant influence is presumed to exist when the Group holds between 20% and 50% of the voting power of another entity.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method and are recognised initially at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of equity accounted investees, after adjustments to align the accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
Changes in accounting policies Accounting for business combinations From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations 2008 in accounting for business combinations.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
The impact on earnings per share is disclosed in note 3. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
Control is the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that currently are exercisable.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as: the fair value of the consideration transferred: plus the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree: plus if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree: less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.

com Group PLC 49 Annual Report 2011 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships.
Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.
If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.
Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Where the contigent consideration is dependent on future employment, it shall be treated as a cost of continuing employment, and therefore is recognised as an expense over the relevant period.
Acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010 For acquisitions between 22 June 2007 and 1 January 2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group was established via a series of transactions that occurred concurrently on 22 June 2007.
These comprised the incorporation of the Company with Simon Nixon as sole shareholder, the acquisition by the Company using a share for share exchange of Simon Nixons 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited and the acquisition by the Company of all other shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited from third parties.
The acquisition of Simon Nixons shares was between two parties, being Simon Nixon and the Company, who were under common control at the time of the transaction.
The acquisition was of an interest in a company which gave the investor a significant influence in the company and it was concluded that this arrangement was a common control transaction and not within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations.
As a result the Company accounted for this 45% interest in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited at original carrying value rather than fair value at the date of the acquisition.
The acquisition of the remaining shares in Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited was accounted for in accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations applying the accounting guidance for a business combination achieved in stages.
This resulted in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited being recognised in full and the goodwill in respect of the acquisition from third parties being recognised.
Foreign currency The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
The functional currency of the foreign operation icero GmbH is the euro.
The income and expenses of the foreign operation are translated into sterling at an average exchange rate for the period in which the activity occurred.
The assets and liabilities of the foreign operation are translated into sterling using exchange rates ruling as at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising upon translation is taken directly to a separate component of equity.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised as a profit or loss.
Revenue The Group generates fees from internet lead generation click based revenue, commissions from brokerage sales and advertising through a variety of contractual arrangements.
The Group recognises click based revenues and associated costs in the period that the lead is generated.
Brokerage commissions are recognised at the point of completion of the transaction with the customer.
Advertising revenue is recognised in the period when an advertisement is delivered to the end user.
Revenue is recognised net of value added tax.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.

com Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Depreciation is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment.
Assets under construction are not depreciated until brought into use.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Buildings 50 years Plant and equipment including IT equipment 3 years Fixtures and fittings 5 years Office equipment 5 years The useful lives and depreciation rates are reassessed at each reporting date.
Intangible assets Goodwill Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets The cost of other intangible assets acquired in a business combination is fair value as at the date of acquisition.
After initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
All the Groups intangible assets other than goodwill have been identified as having finite useful lives.
As such, they are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic life and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.
The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangible asset with a finite useful life is reviewed at least at each financial year end.
The amortisation expense on intangible assets with finite lives is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income in the expense category consistent with the function of the intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Market-related 10 years Customer relationships 7 years Customer lists 3 years Technology 3 years Market-related intangible assets are defined as those that are primarily used in the marketing or promotion of products and services, for example trademarks, trade names and internet domain names.
Customer-related intangible assets consist of customer lists, customer contracts and relationships, and non-contractual customer relationships.
For accounting purposes, customer relationships and customer lists have been identified separately.
Relationships with high-profile customers provide the Group with prominence in the marketplace, create volume and traffic on the website, and enhance the reputation of the brand.
Customer lists allow the Group to undertake targeted marketing activities.
Technology-based intangible assets relate to innovations and technical advances such as computer software, patented and unpatented technology, databases and trade secrets.
Impairment The carrying amounts of the Groups assets are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If such indication exists, the assets recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
For the purposes of impairment reviews, the recoverable amount of the Groups assets is taken to be the higher of their fair value less costs to sell and their value in use.
Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining technical knowledge and understanding, is charged to the Statement of Comprehensive Income when incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised when it meets the criteria outlined in IAS 38.
Expenditure that does not meet the criteria is expensed directly to the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the Statement of Cash Flows.
com Group PLC 51 Annual Report 2011 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
Share-based payment transactions The Groups share schemes allow certain Group employees to acquire ordinary shares in the Company.
The fair value of share awards made is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at award date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the awards.
The fair values of the share awards are measured using the Monte Carlo method for options subject to a market-based condition and the Black-Scholes model for all others, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of share awards expected to vest.
Short-term employee benefits Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as the related service is provided.
A provision is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Advertising costs The Group incurs costs from advertising via a number of different media.
Costs associated with the production of adverts are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Comprehensive Income only once the advert is available to the Group in a format ready for use, having been approved for airing or displaying.
The cost of airing or displaying the advert is taken as an expense in the period in which the advert is aired or displayed.
Finance income Finance income comprises interest receivable, which is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues using the effective interest method.
Dividends Dividends payable to the Companys shareholders are recognised as a liability and deducted from shareholders equity in the period in which the shareholders right to receive payment is established.
Taxation Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the Statement of Comprehensive Income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination: and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
In the year ended 31 December 2010 a deferred tax liability was recognised at the expected future tax rate of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which were acquired with Financial Services Net Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
A deferred tax liability was recognised in the year ended 31 December 2007 as 30% of the value of the intangible assets with finite lives which were generated upon the acquisition of Moneysupermarket.
com Financial Group Limited, representing the tax effect of the amortisation of these assets in future periods.
This liability has since been revalued to 25% of the value of the intangible assets.

Group management of capital The Groups objectives when managing capital are: to safeguard the entitys ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders: and to provide an adequate return to shareholders by pricing products and services commensurately with the level of risk.
The Group sets the amount of capital in proportion to risk.
The Group manages the capital structure and makes adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
In assessing the level of capital all components of equity are taken into account, i. e. share capital, retained earnings and reserves where applicable, as well as unvested share options and awards.
In line with internal capital management requirements, the Group manages its cash balances by depositing them with a number of financial institutions to reduce credit risk.
The Group had no debt as at 31 December 2011 and is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements: management of capital therefore focuses around its ability to generate cash from its operations.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, or sell assets to raise funds.
During the year the shareholders authorised the Company to purchase up to 50,928,800 of its own shares for cancellation or to be held as treasury shares.
The Group believes it is meeting its objectives for managing capital as funds are available for reinvestment where necessary as well as being in a position to make returns to shareholders where this is felt appropriate.
There were no changes to the Groups approach to capital management during the year.
Standards, amendments and interpretations adopted during the period The Group has adopted the following amendments and interpretations which have not had a significant impact on the Groups results: Revised IAS 24 Related Party Disclosures 2009 Amendments to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Standards, amendments and interpretations issued but not yet effective A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations have been issued during the year ended 31 December 2011 but are not yet effective, and therefore have not yet been adopted by the Group.
These are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups accounts when adopted, except where stated.
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 2011 this standards objective is to give clearer guidance on how to measure fair value assets, liabilities and equity instruments held by a company by providing a precise definition of fair value and a single source of fair value measurement and disclosure requirements for use across IFRSs.
This standard has not yet been endorsed by the EU.
Amended IAS 1 Presentation of financial statements 2010 the objective of this amendment is to improve the presentation of certain items of other comprehensive income, requiring separate subtotals for those elements which may be recycled.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 2010 this standards objective is to gradually phase out IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Phase one of this process specifically requires financial assets to be classified at amortised cost or at fair value.
Further development phases for IFRS 9 are scheduled to cover key areas such as impairment, hedge accounting and the offsetting of assets and liabilities.
Early adoption is permitted, once endorsed by the EU.
3 Acquisitions Financial Services Net Limited On 14 October 2010, the Group acquired all of the shares in Financial Services Net Limited FSN for 4.4 million, satisfied in cash with a further 400,000 payable pending the outcome of certain matters, and a contingent payment of up to 4 million payable up to the third anniversary of handover upon the achievement of specified financial targets by FSN.
The company operates a range of websites in the financial services sector aimed at putting consumers in touch with brokers or product providers who will provide them with the product they are looking for.

The deferred tax liability represents the tax effect which was expected to result from the amortisation of the intangible assets, estimated using the anticipated future tax rate and the fair value of the different classes of asset.
000 Consideration: Initial consideration, paid in cash 4,412 Contingent consideration 2,608 Total consideration 7,020 The initial consideration included a payment of 4,330,000 which was made during the prior period, and a balancing payment of 82,000 which was expected to be made after 31 December 2010.
The contingent consideration included two elements: Up to 400,000 which may become due dependent upon the outcome of ongoing discussions around the indirect tax treatment of certain income streams.
Management estimated that there was a 50% probability of this amount becoming due and recognised 200,000 of contingent consideration, which represented its fair value at the acquisition date.
This matter was still ongoing at the balance sheet date, and therefore no adjustment has been made to this estimate.
Up to 4 million which may become due upon the achievement of financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement.
Up to one third of this amount will be payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the handover date.
Management estimated the amount of this element which will become payable by attributing different probabilities to a range of possible outcomes derived from the most recent forecasts of the business performance.
The Group included 2,408,000 as contingent consideration related to this additional consideration, which represented its fair value at the acquisition date.
In line with IFRS 3, during the year the Group updated its estimations of the amount of contingent consideration which will become payable, based on the business performance since acquisition, and its most recent forecasts.
Management now estimate that only 186,000 of the contingent consideration will become payable, and as such have recognised a credit of 2,222,000 in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period within administrative expenses.

com Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 3 Acquisitions continued Local Daily Deals Limited On 31 August 2011, the Group acquired 51% of the issued share capital of Local Daily Deals Limited LDD for 1.0 million, satisfied in cash, with 0.5 million paid to the existing shareholders for existing shares, and subsequently a further 0.5 million paid to LDD for the issue of new shares.
In addition, the Group has a call option over the remaining share capital which it has the right to exercise on the third anniversary of the acquisition date, the consideration for which will be determined by the achievement of specified financial targets by LDD.
Should the Group not exercise its call option, the existing shareholders of LDD have the right to exercise a put option on the same terms.
The company operates a website which features discounted retail offers, with the aim of introducing businesses to new customers who are looking for a good deal.
In the four months to 31 December 2011 the subsidiary contributed revenue of 304,000 and a net loss of 310,000 to the consolidated profit for the year.
If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2011, Group revenue would have been an estimated 181.2 million and profit would have been an estimated 16.7 million.
In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on the first day of the accounting period.
Effect of acquisition The acquisition had the following effect on the Groups assets and liabilities.
Pre-acquisition Fair Recognised carrying value values on amounts adjustments acquisition 000 000 000 LDDs net assets at the acquisition date: Property, plant and equipment 45 45 Trade and other receivables 3 3 Cash and cash equivalents 493 493 Trade and other payables 156 156 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 385 385 Goodwill on acquisition 615 Total consideration 1,000 A detailed description of the different intangible assets which have been identified within the acquired business, and the methods used to value them, are provided within note 12.
000 Consideration: Initial consideration, paid in cash 1,000 The initial consideration includes a payment of 500,000 which was made to the existing shareholders for the purchase of existing shares, and the subsequent payment of 500,000 to LDD for the issue of new shares in the company.
Additional consideration of up to 10 million may become due on the third anniversary of the acquisition date upon the achievement of financial performance measures specified in the purchase agreement, and either the exercise by the Group of its call option, or the exercise by the existing shareholders of their put option.
Management have estimated the amount of this element which will become payable by attributing different probabilities to a range of possible outcomes derived from the most recent forecasts of the business performance.
Since this element of consideration is dependent upon the continued employment of the individuals concerned, the fair value of the amount of contingent consideration that management expect to become payable will be charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income over the combined life of the earnout period and the related call and put options.
At the balance sheet date the fair value of the contingent consideration was 1,029,000, and 96,000 has been charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income during the period, included within administrative expenses.
The Group incurred acquisition-related costs of 0.5m relating to legal and advisory fees, and costs related to the integration of the business into the Group, which have been expensed in administrative expenses.
The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share is a decrease of 0.06p per share.
The Group has accounted for the acquisition using the anticipated acquisition method, whereby 100% of LDDs results since acquisition have been consolidated into the results of the Group, as a result of the call and put options which exist over the non-controlling interest.

The Group expects that the result of this will be a reduction in the effective tax rate in future periods.
Unrecognised tax losses The Group has tax losses arising from the results of a foreign subsidiary of 240,000 2010: 584,000.

com Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued On an annual basis, or where an indication exists, the Group is required to assess its goodwill and intangible assets for impairment.
During 2007 the Group employed the services of an appropriately qualified and experienced independent third party to value the intangible assets acquired from Moneysupermarket.
This valuation was used as the initial carrying value for these assets.
Following the impairment provision in 2008, the market capitalisation of the Group approximated to the total carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets of the Group.
At 31 December 2011 the market capitalisation exceeded the carrying value of the goodwill, intangible and other non-current assets, and net current assets by more than 100% 2010: more than 100%.
On adoption of IFRS 8 the Group was required to allocate goodwill between its cash generating units CGU that represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes, but are not larger than an operating segment as defined by IFRS 8.
These CGUs are the four operating segments Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services.
In addition, the two recently acquired businesses, FSN and LDD, are separate CGUs for the purposes of monitoring goodwill.
The Group has performed impairment testing at a CGU level.
The goodwill was allocated on 1 January 2009 based on estimates of the relative values of the operating segments at that date with 30.7m allocated to Insurance, 15.5m to Money, 6.6m to Travel and 2.2m to Home Services.
The balances at 31 December 2011 are in line with those at 1 January 2009.
Goodwill impairment for FSN and LDD has been considered separately from the four verticals and the Group.
Impairment review by vertical and Group For the current year, the recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use and was calculated by reference to the forecast cash flows.
The present value of the future cash flows has been calculated with the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 for each CGU represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2011, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2012 incorporating where possible an allocation of cost of sales and advertising costs.
The main assumptions underlying the 2012 budget relate to visitor numbers, source of visitors, revenue per transaction visitor and marketing spend which incorporate past experience.
The forecast assumes continued improvement during the course of 2012 driven by new media campaigns, utilisation of the Groups data asset and investments made in the core technology for the Groups key channels.
The Insurance and Money segments have been assumed to have similar rates of growth, and the Travel and Home Services segments have been assumed to return to close to the revenue levels achieved in 2008.
Cash flows for subsequent years for all segments are consistent with those in year 1 and assume no further growth.
No reliable third party estimates of long-term growth rates exist for the price comparison industry.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been incorporated into the calculations.
A pre-tax discount rate of 13.5% 2010: 13.5% has been used in the forecast for all segments.
The same discount rate has been used compared with the rate used to test the Internet segment last year to reflect the current stagnation in the wider UK economy, despite the growth which the Group has reported.
When there are clear indications that the economy has fully emerged from recession a different set of assumptions may be more appropriate.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the assets allocated to the Insurance, Money, Travel and Home Services segments exceeds their carrying value by in excess of 100%, and as such, no impairment was identified.
No reasonably possible change to a key assumption would result in an impairment.
As explained in note 4, whilst the Group is able to allocate revenue between the four operating segments, its cost base is reviewed by the Groups Chief Operating Decision Maker at a Group rather than segmental level, and a number of the significant costs which the Group incurs cannot be allocated either directly or on a reasonable and consistent basis to the CGUs that are each operating segment.
Therefore the cash flows estimated above include all of the Groups forecast revenues, but only approximately 60% of the Groups cost base.
The Group has therefore also performed a further impairment test for the Group as a whole, in a manner consistent with previous years.
In these calculations the Group is treated as one group of CGUs, and the test compared the carrying amount, including goodwill and other corporate assets, to the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount has been estimated based on the present value of its future cash flows which has been calculated with a set of assumptions consistent with those set out above in relation to the individual operating segment calculations.
The analysis performed calculates that the recoverable amount of the Groups assets exceeds their carrying value by 264m 2010: 152m, and as such, no impairment was identified.
With regard to the Group level impairment testing, the level of the increase in the discount rate, with all the other assumptions held constant, required to give a value in use for the Groups assets equal to their carrying value, would be in excess of what can reasonably be expected to happen 2010: 10% increase.
Similarly, a decrease in the annual cash flows of 35.0m 2010: 20.0m with all other assumptions held constant, would also give a value in use for the Groups assets equal to their carrying value.
com Group PLC 61 Annual Report 2011 12 Intangible assets continued At an asset category level, management believe that the assumptions relating to each intangible asset remain applicable, and that no adjustment is required to their valuation, nor their useful economic lives.
Acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited The fair value of the intangible assets recognised upon the acquisition of Financial Services Net Limited FSN was calculated as set out below: Market related Within FSN, the main market related intangible assets are the domain names which FSN owns.
These assets were valued using an income-based approach, namely, the royalty savings method, which estimates the royalty which the Group would have to pay a third party to use the domain names if it did not own them, typically as a percentage of the revenue earned from the domain names during their useful economic life of 10 years.
The Group estimated revenue based on the most recent 3 year forecasts, and for later periods assumed inflationary increases of 5%.
A royalty rate of 15% was applied based on available industry data.
A discount rate of 15.8% was used to calculate the present value of the future royalty savings.
Customer relationships This asset represented the value present within the existing relationships which FSN had with product providers and brokers.
The valuation was based on the cash flows which were expected to result from these relationships during the 7 year useful economic life of the asset, adjusted for estimated future attrition of the providers and relationships following the date of acquisition.
Again, the Group based the estimate on the most recent 3 year forecasts, and for later periods assumed inflationary increases of 5%, with an assumed attrition rate of the provider relationships of 50% per annum, based on managements expectations.
A discount rate of 15.8% was used to calculate the present value of the future benefit resulting from the relationships.
Customer lists This asset represented the value of the customer data held by FSN at the date of acquisition, and was valued based on the cost of recreating such a database in the open market, using in-house estimates of the cost of each data element.
The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition of FSN represented the anticipated incremental value which the Group expected to generate by applying the existing skills and expertise within the Groups workforce to the acquired business and assets.
During the period, the Group reassessed the amount of contigent consideration that it expected to become payable with reference to FSNs actual performance since acquisition, and its most recent forecasts.
This exercise resulted in a reduction in the amount of contingent consideration expected to become payable from 2,408,000 to 186,000, which acts as an indicator of impairment, and in light of this, the Group performed a thorough review of the intangible assets and goodwill relating to FSN.
The recoverable amount of the assets was taken to be their value in use, and was calculated by reference to FSNs forecast cash flows.
For the purposes of IFRS 8, FSN is taken to be one CGU.
The present value of the forecast cash flows was calculated with the following key assumptions: Cash flows for year 1 represent managements best estimate of future cash flows as at 31 December 2011, and are based upon the Groups approved budget for 2012.
The main assumptions underlying the budget relate to visitor numbers, the amount of revenue generated per visitor, and the staff resource required to run the business.
The forecast assumes an improvement over 2011, driven by investments in technology and search engine optimisation.
Cash flows for the first five years assume an average 9% per annum increase in the number of visitors, and an average 8% per annum increase in the revenue generated per visitor, whilst payroll costs have been forecast to increase by 5% per annum, with all other costs expected to grow at 3% per annum.
Cash flows after five years assume only market growth.
Cash flows into perpetuity have been built into the model.
A pre-tax discount rate of 16.5% has been used in the forecast.
The analysis performed calculates the value in use of FSN as 5.2m, which corresponds with the carrying value of the business identified intangible assets.
Therefore, an impairment loss of 2.2m has been recognised in the year within adminstrative expenses against a brought forward goodwill balance of 2.2m.
As a result, there is no difference between the carrying value and the recoverable amount of the business intangible assets as at the balance sheet date.
An increase in the discount rate of 1% with all other assumptions held constant would give rise to an additional impairment charge of 0.4m, whilst a decrease in the annual cash flows of 10%, with all other assumptions held constant, would give rise to an additional impairment charge of 0.5m.

com Group PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 12 Intangible assets continued Acquisition of Local Daily Deals Limited LDD The Group recognises its intangible assets in the following asset classes.
No intangible assets were recognised upon the acquisition of LDD for the following reasons: Market related At acquisition the main market related intangible asset was the domain name which LDD owned.
Assets such as this are typically valued using an income-based approach, based on estimated revenue in the companys most recent forecasts, and the savings which the Group or an equivalent third party would expect to make by now owning the domain name.
Prior to acquisition the companys website attracted low volumes of visitors, and since acquisition the website has been relocated within the Groups main website.
In light of this, the Group have not assigned any value to the domain name or any other market related intangible assets.
Customer relationships This asset class represents the value within the existing relationships which LDD has with its business partners.
Given the nature of LDDs business and the short life-time of the relationships, the Group has not identified any value within this asset.
Customer lists This asset class represents the value of the customer data held by LDD at the date of acquisition.
The volume of customer data held by the business has been assessed by management as immaterial.
As such no value has been identified within this asset.
Technology This asset class relates to technical innovations and advances such as databases, software and trade secrets.
Whilst the business did own the website on which its business operates, the cost of replicating such a website has been estimated by management as immaterial to the Groups operations.
The goodwill balance recognised upon the acquisition of LDD represents the anticipated incremental value which the Group expects to generate by applying its existing customer database and expertise to the LDD business.
The Group does not expect any of the goodwill to be deductible for tax purposes.
Given the proximity of the acquisition of the above assets to the year end date no impairment review has been completed to date, and no indication of impairment has been identified.
