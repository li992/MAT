NOTES TO CONSOLIdATEd FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C ONTI N U E d 21 S hARE-BASEd PAYMENTS C ONTI N U E d TSR will be measured in comparison to a peer group of 18 international oil companies selected based on one of or a combination of size market capitalisation, revenue, turnover, cash expenditure or a combination thereof, area of operations and country of domicile.
The TSR measurement will be conducted by independent consultants in discussion with the Remuneration Committee.
Since there are market-related conditions the awards of shares under LTIP were fair valued using the Monte Carlo model which takes into account the market-based performance conditions which effectively estimate the number of shares expected to vest.
The expected volatility was assessed based on the historic volatility of the Companys TSR and volatility of the TSR of each company within the comparator group.
No subsequent adjustment is made to the fair value charge for shares that do not vest in the event that these performance conditions are not met.
Adjustments are, however, made for leavers.
The fair value of the awards is recognised as an employee expense with the corresponding increase in equity.
The total amount to be expensed is spread over the vesting period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the shares and options.
The table below summarises the main assumptions used to fair value the awards made under the above LTIP and the fair values of the shares granted.

The 2008 Long Term Incentive Plan Performance Share Plan the2008 LTIP was approved by Shareholders at the AGM on 19 June 2008.
The 2008 LTIP compared the Companys TSR over a three year period ended 19 June 2011 against a comparator group of 18 international oil companies.
The 2008 LTIP comprised of two plans, one for members of staff and another for the Executive Directors.
The plan for the Executive Directors included an additional share price performance condition over-and-above the Companys relative TSR performance.
Independent executive reward consultants, Hay Group, compared the Companys TSR against the comparator group during this three year period.
It was found that while Heritage exceeded the TSR performance measure, the additional 2008 LTIP performance conditions for the Executive Directors were not met and so none of their awards over 3,507,246 shares vest.
While performance conditions for the staff plan were achieved with the result that all of the awards of 1,419,187 shares could have vested in accordance with the plan.
Participants have agreed due to a range of contributing factors to forego 25% of their potential awards in accordance with the 2008 LTIP rules.
As a result, awards over a total of only 1,064,372 shares will vest.
The Remuneration Committee also approved of such a reduction in accordance with the 2008 LTIP rules.
Pursuant to the waiver of the application of Rule 9 of the City Code approved by shareholders at the last AGM, the Remuneration Committee agreed with Anthony Buckingham, the Companys CEO, to issue his 2011 LTIP awards under the 2008 LTIP, however, Anthony Buckinghams awards fully reflect the terms and conditions of all the other 2011 LTIP awards.
