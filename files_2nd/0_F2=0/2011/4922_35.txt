The changes announced were further decreases in the rate of UK corporation tax to 26% from April 2011 to 25% from April 2012 and by a further 1% each year to 23% from April 2014.
The reductions to 26% and 25% were substantively enacted during the year, as were reductions in the main and special rates of capital allowances from 20% and 10% to 18% and 8% respectively effective from April 2012.
The effect on the Group of these changes to the UK tax system have been reflected in the Groups financial statements for the 52 weeks ending 25 December 2011 to the extent which they have been substantively enacted as at 25 December 2011.
The further reductions to 24% and 23% had not been substantively enacted at the year end and therefore are not reflected in these financial statements.
The maximum effect of the future reduction in the tax rate on the Groups deferred tax asset would be to reduce the deferred tax asset by 860,000 2012: 1,131,000.
The rate change will also impact the amount of future cash tax payments to be made in the Group.
