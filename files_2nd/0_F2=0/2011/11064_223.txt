Financial instruments and risk management Risk management The Groups principal financial liabilities, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans and overdrafts, high yield bonds, trade payables, cash-settled share-based payments payable and leasing contracts.
The main purpose of these financial liabilities is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various financial assets such as trade receivables, cash, restricted cash and short-term deposits, which arise directly from its operations.
The most significant risks that the Group is exposed to are foreign exchange rate risk on sales and purchases in foreign currencies, interest rates tied to variable market interest rates and credit risk resulting from potential insolvency of key customers, which might occur especially in the steel industry.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarized below.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, primarily interest rate swaps, interest rate collars and forward currency contracts.
The purpose is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout 2011 and 2010 the Groups policy that no speculative trading in derivatives shall be undertaken.
Credit Risk Credit risk arises from the potential inability of debtors to meet their obligations as they fall due.
Credit risk is addressed by top management and related departments by efficient sales operations to prevent excessive bad debts.
At the balance sheet date there are concentrations of credit risk to steel producers.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
