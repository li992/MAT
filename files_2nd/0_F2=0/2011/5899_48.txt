The restructuring costs provision principally relates to remaining obligations associated with prior year restructuring programmes.
The property and environmental provision principally relates to onerous leases.
The provision for contingent and deferred consideration on acquisitions relates to the estimated value of earn-out payments and other obligations based on the future performance of acquired businesses or other non-performance related deferred payments.
The redemption liability on acquisitions relates to the obligation in respect of put and call options in relation to the purchase of non-controlling interests in acquisitions.
Where these amounts are material, they have been discounted at rates between 3.5% and 7.2%, representing a suitable pre-tax rate based on borrowings that match the maturity of the consideration being discounted, to reflect the risks associated with future cash flows.
Provisions are expected to be utilised within one year in respect of restructuring costs, three years in respect of property and environmental, three years in respect of contingent and deferred consideration of acquisitions and six years in respect of redemption liability on acquisitions.
