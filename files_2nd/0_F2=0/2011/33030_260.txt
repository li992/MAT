The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the fair values of the TSR elements of the 2011, 2010 and 2009 CPP and EDIP grants and the 2009 PSP grant.
In accordance with the plans rules, the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against its principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historical dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients, which are determined by the remuneration committee according to established criteria.
