Notes to the Financial Statements For the 53 weeks ended 3 September 2011 1 Basis of Preparation and General Information Introduction Debenhams plc the Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006 Company No.
The address of the registered office is Debenhams plc, 1 Welbeck Street, London W1G 0AA.
The principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company.
The principal activities of the Group and its subsidiaries together the Group or the Debenhams Group is the sale of fashion clothing and accessories, cosmetics and products for use in the home.
The Group trades from department stores and small store formats in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark, on the internet and has international franchise stores.
The Group prepares its Financial Statements for the financial year ending on the nearest Saturday to 31 August of a given calendar year.
Consequently the year ended 3 September 2011 is a 53 week year, with the comparative year ended 28 August 2010 being a 52 week year.
The principal companies within the Group during the financial year ended 3 September 2011 are disclosed in note 34.
Basis of Preparation The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS including International Accounting Standards IAS and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRS IC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under accounting standards as adopted for use in the EU.
The Consolidated Financial Statements for the financial year ended 3 September 2011 and 28 August 2010 have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
The preparation of the Financial Statements, in conformity with IFRS, requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reporting amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the Financial Statements and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these results are based on managements best knowledge of the amounts, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates see note 5.
2 Accounting Policies The Groups principal accounting policies, as described below, have been consistently applied to all years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Consolidation The Financial Statements comprise a consolidation of the accounts of Debenhams plc and all its subsidiaries.
Subsidiaries include all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which the Group has the power to control.
They are fide-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
On consolidation, inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Accounting policies of the Company and its subsidiaries have been changed where these have a significant impact on the Groups Income Statement or Balance Sheet to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the Group.
Revenue Recognition Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, and is stated net of value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Revenue on department store sales of goods and commission on concession and consignment sales is recognised when goods are sold to the customer.
Retail sales are usually in cash or by credit or debit card.
Internet sales are recognised when the goods are despatched to the customer.
Revenue from gift cards and gift vouchers sold by the Group is recognised on the redemption of the gift card or gift voucher.
It is the Groups policy to sell its products to the end customer with a right of return.
Accumulated experience is used to estimate and provide for such returns at the time of sale.
Segmental Reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires segment information to be presented based on what is reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker.
The Group has identified the executive management board as its Chief Operating Decision Maker and has identified one operating segment, Retail.
Interest Recognition Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the interest rate applicable.
Finance charges are calculated using the effective interest rate method.
Dividend Distribution A final dividend distribution to the Company shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Company and Groups Financial Statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company shareholders.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
68 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategic review Finance review Sustainability Governance Accounts 2 Accounting Policies continued Retirement Benefit Costs The liability or asset recognised in respect of defined benefit schemes is the fair value of the plan assets less the present value of the defined obligation at the balance sheet date.
Plan assets include various equities, bonds and alternative strategies and are managed separately by investment managers.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligations is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in sterling and that have terms to maturity which approximate to the terms of the related pension liabilities.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur.
They are recognised outside the Income Statement and presented in the Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the Income Statement, unless the changes in pension plans are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark and a stakeholder scheme in the UK.
Contributions to these pension schemes are charged to the Income Statement as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the Balance Sheet.
The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
Share-Based Payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
A fair value for the equity-settled share awards is measured at the date of grant.
The Group measures the fair value using the valuation technique most appropriate to value each class of award, a Black-Scholes, Monte Carlo or Binomial pricing model.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision to original estimates, if any, in the Income Statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company issues new shares.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital at nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
Exceptional Items Exceptional items are events or transactions which, by virtue of their size or nature, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the Financial Statements.
Foreign Exchange a Functional and Presentational Currency Items included in the Financial Statements of each of the Groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates the functional currency.
The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in sterling, which is the Groups presentational currency.
b Group Companies The results and financial position of all Group entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows: assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of the Balance Sheet income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transaction resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity c Transactions and Balances Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the respective functional currency at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on exchange are taken to the Income Statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets such as equities classified as available for sale are included in the fair value reserve in equity.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and the translation of intercompany loans are presented in the income statement within finance income or charges.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are presented in the income statement within cost of sales.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 69 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting Policies continued Taxation Taxation expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current tax is based on taxable profits for the financial period using tax rates that are in force during the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
If deferred tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversals of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Leased Assets a Finance Leases Leases of assets which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are classified as finance leases.
Finance leases are classified as a financial liability and measured at amortised cost.
Finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the lower of the fair value of the leased plant and equipment or the present value of the minimum lease payments and depreciated over the shorter of the useful economic life or the period of the lease.
The resulting lease obligations are included in liabilities.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
b Operating Leases All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases, net of lease incentives, are charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Where property lease contracts contain guaranteed fixed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Business Combinations The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of the consideration given, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree.
All costs directly attributable to an acquisition are expensed to the Income Statement.
Identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the acquisition date, provided they meet the conditions set out in IFRS 3 Revised Business Combinations.
The excess of cost over the Groups share of identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
If, after reassessment, the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of assets acquired, the excess is immediately recognised in the Income Statement.
Intangible Assets a Goodwill Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Groups share of the net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary.
Goodwill on acquisition of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets.
Goodwill is not amortised but tested for impairment annually, or when trigger events occur, and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which have been allocated to groups of cash-generating units on a regional basis for the purpose of impairment testing.
b Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets are held at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provision for impairment.
Acquired licences and trademarks are capitalised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful life, not to exceed ten years.
Internally generated software costs, where it is clear that the software developed is technically feasible and will be completed and that the software generated will generate economic benefit, are capitalised as an intangible asset.
The software is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life, being three to eight years.
Included within intangible assets are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise primarily web development projects including directly attributable costs to bring the assets into use.
No amortisation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
70 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategic review Finance review Sustainability Governance Accounts 2 Accounting Policies continued Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are held at historic purchase cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use.
Depreciation is provided at the following rates per annum to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment, less residual value, on a straight-line basis from the date on which they are brought into use: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 1 per cent Long leasehold land and buildings including landlords fixtures and fittings 1 per cent or life of lease if shorter Short leasehold land and buildings including landlords fixtures and fittings Life of lease Retail fixtures and fittings 425 per cent Office equipment 1012.5 per cent Computer equipment 1433 per cent Vehicles 25 per cent or life of lease The assets useful economic lives and residual values are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Gains and losses on disposal are determined by comparing proceeds with carrying amount.
These are included in the Income Statement.
Included within property, plant and equipment are assets in the course of construction.
These assets comprise stores, which are under construction, including costs directly attributable to bring the asset into use.
Transfers to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment are made when the store opens.
No depreciation is provided on stores or other assets under construction.
Impairment Testing Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment.
Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an assets fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped by store, which is the lowest level for which there are separately identifiable cash flows cash-generating units.
Nonfinancial assets other than goodwill that have been impaired are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal of the impairment.
Available-for-Sale Investments The Group classifies its investments as available-for-sale financial assets in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
Available-for-sale financial investments are non-derivative assets.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Investments are recognised at fair value plus any transaction costs.
The fair value of available-for-sale investments denominated in a foreign currency is calculated in that foreign currency and translated at the spot rate at the reporting date.
An impairment test is performed annually on the carrying value of each investment.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in equity.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value using the retail method and represent goods for resale.
This method intrinsically takes into account any stock loss or mark down to goods sold below cost.
Concession inventories are not included within inventory held by the Group.
Trade Receivables Trade receivables are stated at amortised cost less provisions for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the Income Statement.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at the bank and other short-term liquid investments with original maturities of approximately three months or less.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Balance Sheet.
Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost.
Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the Income Statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing Costs Borrowing costs that are facility costs are recognised initially at fair value, and are amortised over the term of the facilities using the effective interest rate on the committed amount of each facility.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 71 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2 Accounting Policies continued Debt Repurchase The nominal value of debt repurchased has been accounted for as a loan redemption, reducing net borrowings at the balance sheet date.
Trade Payables Trade payables, defined as financial liabilities in accordance with IAS 39, are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
All of the trade payables are non-interest bearing.
Other payables Included within other payables are lease incentives received from landlords either through developers contributions or rent-free periods.
These incentives are being credited to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events and where it is more likely than not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at managements best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Promotional activities Provisions for promotional activities such as the cosmetics loyalty scheme are recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation to provide a customer with goods or services.
Restructuring Provisions for restructuring are recognised when the Group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring that has been communicated to affected parties.
Share Capital Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares in equity are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Derivatives Derivatives comprise interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as an effective hedging instrument and the nature of the item being hedged.
The Group designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Group also documents its assessment, both at the inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items.
i Cash Flow Hedges The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the relevant line of the Income Statement which will be affected by the underlying hedged item.
Forward exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are fide-designated and subsequently classified as held for trading when the underlying forecast transaction is recognised in the Financial Statements.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified and adjusted against the initial measurement of the underlying hedged item when the underlying hedged item is recognised on the Balance Sheet or in the Income Statement.
When a hedged instrument expires, is sold or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, hedge accounting is discontinued.
Any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time is held in equity until the forecast transaction occurs.
When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately reclassified to the relevant line of the Income Statement, which would have been affected by the forecasted transaction.
ii Derivatives That Do Not Qualify For Hedge Accounting Certain derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the Income Statement within finance costs.
72 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategic review Finance review Sustainability Governance Accounts 2 Accounting Policies continued New Standards and Interpretations The following new standards and interpretations are mandatory for the first time this year: however these have had no significant impact on the Group: IFRS 2 amendment Share-based Payments Group cash-settled share-based payment transactions IAS 32 amendment Presentation on classification of rights issues Improvements to IFRSs 2009 IFRS IC 15 Agreements for the construction of real estate IFRS IC 19 Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity instruments The International Accounting Standards Board IASB and International Financial Reporting Standards Interpretations Committee IFRS IC has issued the following standards and interpretations which are effective for annual accounting periods beginning on or after the stated effective date.
These standards and interpretations are not effective for and have not been applied in the preparation of these Financial Statements: Effective date International Accounting Standards IFRS IAS 19 revised Employee benefits 1 January 2013 IAS 24 revised Related party disclosures 1 January 2011 Annual improvements 2010 1 January 2011 IFRIC Interpretations IFRS IC 14 amendment Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement 1 January 2011 The Group is currently considering the implications of the adoption of these standards and interpretations.
The adoption of IAS 19 revised will have a potential impact on the treatment of past service costs and the calculation of expected returns on assets.
The remaining standards are not expected to have a material impact on the Groups Financial Statements.
3 Segmental Reporting IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires disclosure of the operating segments which are reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The CODM has been identified as the executive management board, which includes the executive directors and other key management.
It is the executive management board that has responsibility for planning and controlling the activities of the Group.
The Groups reportable segment has been identified as Retail.
The operating segment Magasin is not a reportable segment as it does not exceed 10 per cent of Group revenues, profits or gross assets: however, this information has been presented voluntarily within the segmental analysis below as it is regularly provided to the CODM.
The segments are reported to the CODM to operating profit level, using the same accounting policies as applied to the Group accounts.
No analysis has been provided of the assets and liabilities of each operating segment as this information is not regularly provided to the CODM within the monthly operating pack.

Management believes that gross transaction value, which presents revenue on a gross basis before adjusting for concessions, consignments, staff discounts and the cost of loyalty scheme points, represents a good guide to the overall activity of the Group.
3 September 28 August 2011 2010 m m Gross transaction value 2,679.3 2,564.3 5 Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements The Group makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future.
The resulting accounting estimates will, by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period are discussed below.
Estimated Impairment of Goodwill The Group tests whether goodwill has suffered any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy stated in note 2.
The recoverable amount of cash-generating units is determined based on a value-in-use calculation.
The method requires an estimate of future cash flows and the selection of a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the net present value of the cash flows.
See note 14 for further details.
Taxation and Deferred Taxation The Group is subject to income taxes in the UK, the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.
At each financial period end, judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on the best estimates at the balance sheet date.
Significant judgement is also required in determining the deferred tax on developers contributions, fair value losses and gains, retirement benefit assets and liabilities and other provisions.
The Group recognises deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the best estimate at the balance sheet date.
Where the final tax outcome of the above matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the corporation tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
The final outcome of some of these tax items may give rise to material profit or loss and or cash flow movements.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The fair value is calculated using the appropriate fair value model with the estimated level of vesting being reviewed annually by management.
The key assumptions of this model are set out in note 29.
Retirement Benefits The Groups defined benefit schemes pension asset, which is assessed each period by actuaries, are based on key assumptions including return on plan assets, discount rates, mortality rates, inflation, future salary and pension costs.
These assumptions, individually or collectively, may be different to actual outcomes.
Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions: additional information relating to this is disclosed in note 24.
Estimated Useful Life of Property, Plant and Equipment The Group estimates the useful life of property, plant and equipment and reviews this estimate at each financial period end.
The Group also tests for impairment whenever a trigger event occurs.

Further reductions to the main rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014.
These further changes had not been substantially enacted at the balance sheet date and are therefore not included in these Financial Statements.
The effect of the reduction in the corporation tax rate enacted in the Finance Act 2011 has been to reduce the net deferred tax asset recognised at 28 August 2010 by approximately 0.6 million.
This 0.6 million decrease has been recognised partly as an increase to profits in the Income Statement 1 million and partly as a loss in the Statement of Comprehensive Income of 1.6 million in line with the treatment of the assets and liabilities giving rise to the net deferred tax asset.
The proposed reductions of the main rate of corporation tax by 1 per cent per year to 23 per cent by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
The overall effect of the further changes from 25 per cent to 23 per cent, if applied to the deferred tax balances at 3 September 2011, would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by approximately 0.1 million.

13 Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares, those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.

Goodwill represents the goodwill for a portfolio of sites, which has been allocated to groups of cash-generating units CGUs split on a regional basis according to the level at which management monitors that goodwill.
This allocation was primarily undertaken subsequent to the acquisition in December 2003 of the Debenhams stores by Debenhams plc.
The CGUs are set out below: North Midlands South-East South-West South Other Total m m m m m m m Goodwill 159.3 184.3180.1185.3102.8 7.4 819.2 For the purposes of this impairment review, the recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined based on value-in-use calculations.
These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
The key assumptions used in these projections are sales growth and discount rates.
The five-year plan is built up using managements previous experience and incorporates managements view of current economic conditions and trading expectations.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated based on the assumption of 2% growth after year five.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the retail sector in which the CGUs operate.
The pre-tax discount rate used to calculate the value-in-use was 8.9 per cent 2010: 8.0 per cent and reflects the specific risks in the retail business.
Management determined the gross margin for each CGU based on performance of individual stores and its expectations for the market development.
The weighted average growth rates used are consistent with the forecasts included in industry reports.
The discount rates used are pre-tax and risk-free rates.
Based on the value-in-use calculations, there is substantial headroom on a region by region basis, and a reasonably possible change in the assumptions used would not cause an impairment to goodwill.
As a result of the impairment review, as at 3 September 2011 no impairment of goodwill has been required 2010: nil.

This new facility was due to expire in 2013.
In July 2011 the terms of the credit facility were renegotiated to extend the expiry date to October 2015, with an option to further extend to October 2016.
At 3 September 2011 the Groups facilities outstanding comprised the term loan of 250.0 million 2010: 555.6 million and an RCF of 165.0 million 2010: nil.
During the current and prior years the Group has complied with its covenants relating to its credit facilities.
Issue costs, which mainly relate to facility costs, are being amortised over the term of the facilities to October 2015 at the effective interest rate based on the committed amount of the term loan.
Additional refinancing costs of 3.3 million were incurred during the year ended 3 September 2011 in respect of the renegotiation of the new credit facilities, which will be amortised over the term of the facility.

The board delegates its responsibility for reviewing and approving Treasury Policy to the Audit Committee.
Reports are prepared monthly covering all areas of treasury activity and policy compliance and are reviewed by the Finance Director.
The board and Audit Committee receive regular reporting covering Treasury activities and policy compliance.
Group Treasury manages the Groups funding requirements and financial risks in line with the agreed treasury policies and procedures.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, primarily include borrowings, cash and liquid resources, available-for-sale assets, trade receivables and trade payables.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage liquidity or raise finance for the Group.
Group Treasury uses derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate risks associated with the Groups financing and currency risk arising from the Groups operations.
The derivatives used are mainly interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, which include: funding and liquidity risk credit risk foreign exchange risk interest rate risk other price risk The Groups overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows: i Funding and Liquidity Risk Prudent liquidity risk management implies sufficient cash and marketable securities, the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, Group Treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of retained profits, debt finance and leases.
The objective is to ensure that there is sufficient cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash flow requirements of the Group for its current business plan.
The table below shows the maturity analysis of the Groups net contractual undiscounted cash flows in respect of non-derivative financial liabilities and derivative assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or by credit and debit cards, wholesale sales of products to franchisees are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high credit-quality financial institutions.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
The Groups policy requires that cash surpluses are placed on deposit for no longer than three months and only with counterparties with a credit rating of Aor A3 or higher as assigned by Standard & Poors or Moodys respectively.
Exceptions to this policy require board approval.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements net of any provision for losses represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
iii Foreign Exchange Risk The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar, the euro and to a lesser extent the Danish krone.
To manage the foreign exchange transaction risk, entities in the Group use forward currency contracts transacted by Group Treasury.
Foreign exchange risk arises when commercial transactions are denominated in a currency that is not the entitys functional currency.
Group Treasury is responsible for managing the exposure in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts with a settlement of up to two years.
Forecast cash flows are hedged to the extent that those cash flows are deemed highly probable.
The Group regularly reviews the need to hedge foreign exchange exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of its non-sterling businesses, hedging those exposures to the extent that they are considered appropriate for hedging.
A loss of 1.8 million 2010: gain of 4.3 million was reclassified from equity to the Income Statement within cost of sales during the year in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional value of open forward foreign exchange contracts at 3 September 2011 was 461.1 million 2010: 425.0 million.
The net fair value losses on open forward foreign exchange contracts at 3 September 2011 are 4.2 million 2010: gains of 6.4 million.
This will be recycled and adjusted against the initial measurement of the acquisition cost of inventory over the next two years.
During the current and prior years there were no contracts reclassified to held for trading due to cash flow hedges being ineffective.
iv Interest Rate Risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.
The Groups current borrowing facilities are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The aim is to reduce exposure to interest rate movements and to take advantage of low interest rates by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure whilst maintaining the flexibility to minimise early termination costs.
The Groups interest rate hedging strategy is to achieve a target fixed percentage of 75 per cent, with a 15 per cent tolerance 60-90 per cent.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed through the use of floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
These are usually matched with specific loans for a period of time up to their maturity or call date.
The Groups main interest rate exposure is from the floating rate loans under the credit facilities.
At the year end the Groups hedged borrowings amounted to 327.5 million 2010: 302.5 million, being 78.4 per cent 2010: 51 per cent of the Groups total borrowings.

The Groups interest rate swap portfolio is summarised as follows: Notional Rate m % Maturity Interest rate swaps 327.5 0.945.3725 November 2011 to October 2015 The notional principal amount of interest rate swaps at 28 August 2010 was 302.5 million.
The net gains and losses on these swaps, which are deferred in equity, will reverse through interest in the Income Statement over the life of the swaps.
During the year a loss of 4.7 million 2010: 6.8 million was reclassified and reported in the Income Statement in respect of interest rate swaps.
Financial Liabilities and Assets The interest rate profiles of financial liabilities after taking account of interest rate swaps, swapped from floating to fixed rates, used to manage interest were as follows: 3 September 2011 28 August 2010 Fixed Floating Total Fixed Floating Total m m m m m m Financial liabilities 1 Sterling 330.3 93.7 424.0 306.5 290.6 597.1 1 Debt issue costs of 11.3 million 2010: 10.8 million are excluded from the financial liabilities above.
Fixed sterling financial liabilities comprise the hedged portion of the term loan of 327.5 million, finance lease liabilities of 2.7 million and 0.1 million of accrued interest at 3 September 2011.
The weighted average interest rate on the fixed rate borrowings as at 3 September 2011 was 3.6 per cent 2010: 5.2 per cent, with the weighted average time for which rates are fixed being 4.2 years 2010: 2.9 years.
Floating rate borrowings are interest bearing at interest rates based on LIBOR.
Cash deposits are interest bearing at rates based on LIBID or relevant base rates.
Non-interest bearing cash refers to cash in stores or in transit.
Floating rate borrowings have been classified as fixed if there were derivative financial instruments hedging the floating rate interest for more than one year.
The interest rate profiles of financial assets were as follows: 3 September 2011 28 August 2010 Non-interest Non-interest Floating bearing Total Floating bearing Total m m m m m m Financial assets Sterling 0.5 20.7 21.2 25.8 22.9 48.7 Euros 0.8 1.2 2.0 11.8 1.2 13.0 US dollars 0.9 0.9 3.3 3.3 Danish kroner 3.1 1.8 4.9 3.0 1.5 4.5 Total financial assets 5.3 23.7 29.0 43.9 25.6 69.5 v Other Price Risk The Group is exposed to price risk arising from equity investments.

At the year end, if the market value had been 10 per cent higher lower, based on the Groups view of reasonably possible changes to the value of the equity investments, when all other variables were held constant: net profit would have been unaffected as the equity investments were classified as available-for-sale investments: and other reserves would decrease increase by 0.3 million 2010: 0.3 million for the Group as a result of the changes in the fair value of available-for-sale investments.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 89 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 22 Financial Risk Management continued b Capital Management The Groups objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, provide returns for shareholders and benefits to other stakeholders and to maintain a structure to optimise the cost of capital.
The Group defines capital as debt and equity.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may consider: the amount of dividend paid to shareholders, the return of capital to shareholders, the issue or sale of shares: or the sale of assets to reduce debt.
The Group routinely monitors its capital and liquidity requirements through leverage ratios consistent with industry-wide borrowing standards, maintaining suitable headroom to bank facility covenants and credit market requirements to ensure financing requirements continue to be serviceable.
c Fair Value Estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward currency contracts has been determined based on discounted market forward currency exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
In the case of the Groups loans due in more than one year, the fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group.
There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities to their fair values at the year end.
d Sensitivity Analysis The Group monitors interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk by determining the effect on profit of a range of possible changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
The range of sensitivities chosen, being 1 per cent movement in the interest rate or 5 per cent movement in sterling when compared to US dollar and euro, reflects the Groups view of reasonably possible changes to these risk variables which existed at the year end.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in foreign exchange and interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments.
The analysis has been produced assuming no changes in the borrowings and existing interest rate swaps portfolio when considering the interest rate movement.
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on the Group as a result of market movements in interest rates in relation to all the Groups financial instruments that are expressed in currencies different to that of the functional currency.

92 Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 Overview Strategic review Finance review Sustainability Governance Accounts 24 Retirement Benefit Obligation The Group operates defined benefit type pension schemes, being the Debenhams Executive Pension Plan and the Debenhams Retirement Scheme together the Groups pension schemes, the assets of which are held in separate trustee-administered funds.
Both pension schemes were closed for future service accrual from 31 October 2006.
The closure to future accrual will not affect the pensions of those who have retired or the deferred benefits of those who have left service or opted out before 31 October 2006.
Future pension arrangements are provided through a money purchase stakeholder plan in the UK or a defined contribution scheme for the employees in the Republic of Ireland and Denmark.
In accordance with the recovery plan for the Groups pension schemes, the Group agreed to contribute 5.8 million per annum from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011 increasing by annual Retail Price Index RPI from the year to 31 December 2009 to fund past service benefits.
The Group has also agreed to contribute a further 7.0 million per annum from 1 April 2011 until 31 August 2021, increasing by annual RPI from the year to 31 December 2009.
If the Company had paid or declared a dividend during the period from 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2011, the Group would have made further contributions of 3.1 per cent and 1.9 per cent of the total amount of the ordinary dividend to the Debenhams Retirement Scheme and Debenhams Executive Pension Plan respectively.
No dividends were declared by the Company during this period.
The Group has also agreed to fund all non-investment expenses and levies incurred by the Groups pension schemes.
The investment strategy for the Groups pension schemes was changed during the year ended 3 September 2011.
Investment of the schemes assets is now arranged by AON Hewitt Limited under a delegated consulting service agreement.
As at 3 September 2011 most of the schemes assets are invested in a delegated liability fund or a delegated growth fund, with some legacy holdings from the former investment strategy due to be transferred to the delegated consulting service arrangement in the future.
Actuarial valuations of the Groups pension schemes using the projected unit basis were carried out at 31 March 2008, and updated as at each relevant year end for the purposes of IAS 19 Employee Benefits by Towers Watson Limited, a qualified independent actuary.
The 31 March 2008 actuarial valuation has been used when calculating the IAS 19 Employee Benefits valuation at 3 September 2011.
An actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2011 is being performed by Towers Watson Limited.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 3 September 28 August 29 August 2011 2010 2009 per annum per annum per annum % % % Inflation assumption 3.30 3.20 3.30 General salary and wage increase 3.30 3.20 3.30 Rate of increase in pension payments and deferred payments 3.30 3.20 3.30 Pension increase rate 3.20 3.10 3.30 Discount rate 5.75 5.00 5.45 The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the year for return over the entire life of the defined benefit obligation.
The inflation assumption is based on the RPI rate as pension increases both in payment and deferment within the schemes are set out with reference to this measure.

At previous year ends, the expected rates of return on assets were derived as the weighted average of the expected rates of return from each of the main asset classes.

Reverse Acquisition Reserve The reverse acquisition reserve exists as a result of the method of accounting for the 2005 Group reconstruction.
In accordance with International Accounting Standards, the 2005 Group reconstruction has been accounted for as a reverse acquisition.
Hedging Reserve The hedging reserve represents the change in fair value of all interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts which have been designated as cash flow hedges.
The effective portion of the changes in fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised in equity.
Other Reserves The other reserve represents the change in fair value in respect of the Groups available-for-sale investments see note 16 and exchange differences arising as part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation.

An award under the PSP will normally vest on the third anniversary of date of grant and must be exercised within six months of vesting.
No payment is required for the grant of an award.
An award under the PSP will comprise an option to receive free shares or nil cost options with performance conditions attached.
Options Granted on 24 November 2009 and 23 May 2011 The vesting of the shares granted under this plan is dependent on Earnings Per Share EPS growth.
Where growth is less than 6 per cent per annum over the three year period, no options will vest.
Where growth is 6 per cent per annum 30 per cent will vest, where growth is 10 per cent per annum, 100 per cent of the options will vest.
Between these two points the options will vest on a straight-line basis between 30 and 100 per cent.
In accordance with IFRS 2 Share-Based Payments, this is classified as a non-market condition and therefore the shares have been fair valued at face value with a discount to take into account the non entitlement to dividends in the vesting period where relevant.
The fair value of the PSP options granted for these awards is calculated based on a Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown in the table below.

In accordance with the plan rules, options issued in May 2008 have lapsed during the year as neither the EPS nor the TSR performance conditions were met.
Debenhams Annual Report and Accounts 2011 99 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Share-Based Payments continued ii Executive Share Option Plan The ESOP allows the Company to grant options to acquire shares to eligible employees.
These options will normally become exercisable following a three-year performance period, only if and to the extent that the performance conditions to which they are subject have been satisfied.
Once the options have vested, the employees have a seven year period in which to exercise.
Options are granted with an exercise price equal to the middle market value of the shares on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.
Options Granted on 24 November 2009 The vesting of options granted under this plan is dependent on the Companys Return on Capital Employed ROCE exceeding the Cost of Capital.
Where the ROCE is less than or equal to the Cost of Capital over a three year period, no options will vest.
Where the ROCE is greater than the Cost of Capital, 30 per cent will vest, where the ROCE is greater than the Cost of Capital plus 5 per cent, 100 per cent will vest.
The fair value of the share options has been calculated using a Black-Scholes model.
The key assumptions are set out in the table below.
24 November Grant date 2009 Number of shares under option number 962,692 Expected term years 3.0 Share price at grant pence 85.5 Exercise price pence 85.5 Risk free rate 2.3% Expected volatility 70.0% Expected dividend yield 0% Fair value of option pence 40.7 Volatility has been estimated by taking the historic volatility in the Companys share price.
In accordance with the plan rules, options issued in November 2007 have lapsed as the performance conditions associated with these options were not met.
The weighted average exercise price of the ESOP at 3 September 2011 was 85.5 pence 2010: 95.1 pence.

The fair value of the SIP options granted is calculated based on a Black-Scholes model assuming the inputs shown below: 23 May 16 November 2010 Grant date 2011 Number of shares under option number 150,000 500,000 Expected term years 2.0 2.0 Share price at grant pence 72.0 70.0 Exercise price pence Risk free rate 0% 0% Expected dividend yield 5.0% 5.0% Fair value of option pence 65.1 63.3 The 690,000 remaining options granted under the SIP on 24 November 2009 vested on 23 May 2011. iv Deferred Bonus Matching Plan The DBMP was set up to allow executives and certain members of the management team below board level to invest up to 100 per cent of their net annual bonus earned in respect of 2010 into shares invested shares.
If the participant remains in service for three years and retains the beneficial ownership of all the invested shares s he will be, subject to the satisfaction of certain performance conditions be entitled to a matching share award equal to the amount of the pre-tax bonus that has been invested.

The Group establishes provisions in connection with litigation where it has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, and where it is more likely that not an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Since these provisions, which are reflected in the Groups consolidated financial statements, represent estimates, the final resolution of any such matters could have a material affect on the Groups operating results and cash flows for a particular reporting period.
