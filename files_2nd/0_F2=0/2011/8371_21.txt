Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation Accounting policies applicable to more than one section of the financial statements are shown below.
Where accounting policies relate to a specific note in the financial statements, they are set out within that note, to provide readers of the financial statements with a more useful layout to the financial information presented.
Statement of compliance Intertek Group plc is a company incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The Group financial statements as at and for the year ended 31 December 2011 consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group and include the Groups interest in associates.
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU IFRSs.
The Parent Company financial statements present information about the Company as a separate entity and not about its Group.
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP: these are presented on pages 107 to 110.
Measurement convention The financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except as discussed in the relevant accounting policies.
Functional and presentation currency These consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
All information presented in sterling has been rounded to the nearest 0.1m.
Changes in accounting policies The accounting policies set out in these financial statements have been applied consistently to all years presented.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1January 2011 but do not have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Going concern The Board has reviewed forecasts, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic conditions.
The Board has also reviewed the Groups funding requirements and has taken into consideration the issuance of US$265m notes in January 2012 and the available debt facilities.
As a result of these reviews the Board remains satisfied with the Groups funding and liquidity position and believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully.
In addition, on the basis of its forecasts, both base case and stressed, and available facilities, which are described in note 14, the Board has concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to be appropriate.
Basis of consolidation Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.
For purchases of non-controlling interest in subsidiaries, the difference between the cost of the additional interest in the subsidiary and the non-controlling interests share of the assets and liabilities reflected in the consolidated statement of financial position at the date of acquisition, is reflected directly in shareholders equity.
Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.
Foreign currency Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities for example cash, trade receivables, trade payables denominated in foreign currencies at the reporting date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are generally recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
For the policy on hedging of foreign currency transactions see note 14.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 67 Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign operations The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the reporting date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at cumulative average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of foreign operations are taken directly to equity in the translation reserve.
They are released to the income statement upon disposal.
For the policy on net investment hedging see note 14.
The Group has taken advantage of relief available in IFRS 1, to deem the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero at the date of transition to IFRSs on 1 January 2004.
The most significant currencies for the Group were translated at the following exchange rates: Assets and liabilities Income and expenses Actual rates Cumulative average rates Value of 1 31 Dec 2011 31 Dec 2010 2011 2010 US dollar 1.55 1.55 1.60 1.55 Euro 1.20 1.17 1.15 1.17 Chinese renminbi 9.77 10.26 10.35 10.47 Hong Kong dollar 12.04 12.05 12.47 12.00 Use of judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires management to make judgements and estimates that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the year in which the estimates are revised and in any future years affected.
Judgements In applying the Groups accounting policies, management has applied judgement in the following areas that have a significant impact on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Basis of consolidation Judgement is applied when determining if the Group controls a subsidiary or associate.
In assessing control, the Group considers whether it has the ability to control on a legal or contractual basis rather than whether that control is actually exercised: see note 1 above.
Intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill: see note 9.
Income Tax The tax on profits is determined according to complex tax laws and regulations.
Where the effect of these laws and regulations is unclear, judgements are used in determining the liability for the tax to be paid: see note 6.
Deferred tax Deferred tax assets and liabilities require management judgement in determining the amounts to be recognised, with consideration given to the timing and level of future taxable income: see note 6.
Estimates Discussed below are key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation at the reporting date, that have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities within the next financial year.
Impairment of goodwill The Group determines on an annual basis whether goodwill is impaired.
This requires an estimation of the future cash flows of the cash generating units to which the goodwill is allocated: see note 9.
Claims In making provision for claims, management bases its estimate on the circumstances relating to each specific event, internal and external legal advice, knowledge of the industries and markets, prevailing commercial terms and legal precedents: see note 13.
Contingent consideration When the Group acquires businesses, the total consideration may consist of an amount paid on completion plus further amounts payable on agreed post completion dates.
These further amounts are contingent on the acquired business meeting agreed performance targets.
At the date of acquisition, the Group reviews the profit and cash forecasts for the acquired business and estimates the amount of contingent consideration that is likely to be due: see note 13.
com Notes to the financial statements 1 Significant accounting policies continued Employee post-retirement benefit obligations For material defined benefit plans, the actuarial valuation includes assumptions such as discount rates, return on assets, salary progression and mortality rates: see note 16.
Recoverability of trade receivables Trade receivables are reflected net of an estimated provision for impairment losses.
This provision considers the past payment history and creditworthiness of each account and the length of time that the debt has remained unpaid: see note 11.
Accounting policies relating to a specific note in the financial statements are set out within that note as follows: Note Revenue 2 Separately disclosed items 3 Taxation 6 Property, plant and equipment 8 Goodwill and other intangible assets 9 Trade and other receivables 11 Trade and other payables 12 Provisions 13 Borrowings and financial instruments 14 Capital and reserves 15 Employee benefits 16 Share schemes 17 Non-controlling interest 20 2 Operating segments and presentation of results Accounting policy Revenue Revenue represents the total amount receivable for services rendered, excluding sales related taxes and intra group transactions.
Revenue from services rendered is recognised in the income statement when the relevant service is completed, usually when the report of findings is issued.
The Group records transactions as sales on the basis of value of work done, with the corresponding amount being included in trade debtors if the customer has been invoiced or in accrued income if billing has yet to be completed.
Expenses are recharged to clients where permitted by the contract.
Operating segments The Group is organised into five divisions, each of which offer services to different industries and are managed separately: Commodities: Industry & Assurance: Consumer Goods: Commercial & Electrical and Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals.
The costs of the corporate head office and other costs which are not controlled by the operating divisions are allocated to these divisions.
The divisions noted above are the operating segments that are reported to the Board of Directors, the chief operating decision maker, and are the Groups reportable segments.
Inter-segment pricing is determined on an arms length basis.
There is no significant seasonality in the Groups operations.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
The performance of the segments is assessed based on adjusted operating profit which is before separately disclosed items.
Unallocated items include group-wide projects that do not sit in any one division.
A reconciliation to operating profit by division, and Group profit for the year is included overleaf.
Principal activities are as follows: Commodities provides independent cargo inspection, analytical assessment, calibration and related research and technical services to the worlds petroleum, mining, minerals and biofuels industries.
The division also provides services to governments and regulatory bodies to support trade activities that help the flow of goods across borders.
Industry & Assurance using in-depth knowledge of the oil, gas, nuclear, power, renewable energy, construction, food, chemical and agricultural industries, the division provides a diverse range of services to help customers meet global quality standards.
These include asset integrity management, exploration and production support, consulting, training and third-party management systems auditing.
The division also provides certification services, second-party supplier auditing, sustainability data verification and process performance analysis.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 69 Notes to the financial statements 2 Operating segments and presentation of results continued Consumer Goods the division is a market leading provider of services to the textiles, toys, footwear, hardlines, food and retail industries.

As described in the Annual Report for 2010, from 1 January 2011 the Groups operational structure was reorganised to improve the alignment of business lines with those of the Groups customers.
Certain divisions were also renamed to describe better their core activities.
The results for the 12 months to 31 December 2011 are reported in the new structure and all prior period comparative figures have been restated to show a like-for-like comparison.
The results of these divisions for the year ending 31 December 2011 are shown below: Year ended 31 December 2011 Revenue InterDepreciation Adjusted Separately from external segment Total and software operating disclosed Operating customers revenue revenue amortisation profit items profit m m m m m m m Commodities 530.2 2.7 532.9 22.0 67.0 2.7 64.3 Industry & Assurance 468.6 2.0 470.6 5.4 50.9 28.9 22.0 Consumer Goods 315.7 1.2 316.9 11.7 106.3 0.9 105.4 Commercial & Electrical 291.0 4.5 295.5 12.6 44.1 2.7 41.4 Chemicals & Pharmaceuticals 143.9 1.9 145.8 5.6 12.8 3.6 9.2 Eliminations 12.3 12.3 Total 1,749.4 1,749.4 57.3 281.1 38.8 242.3 Unallocated separately disclosed items 8.3 8.3 Group operating profit 281.1 47.1 234.0 Net financing costs 21.0 21.0 Profit before income tax 260.1 47.1 213.0 Income tax expense 73.3 11.4 61.9 Profit for the year 186.8 35.7 151.1 Depreciation and software amortisation of 60.2m 2010: 55.3m includes unallocated charges of 2.9m 2010: 1.7m.

Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 71 Notes to the financial statements 3 Separately disclosed items Accounting policy Adjusted results In order to present the performance of the Group in a clear, consistent and comparable format, certain items are disclosed separately on the face of the income statement.
Separately disclosed items are items which by their nature or size, in the opinion of the Directors, should be excluded from the adjusted result to provide readers with a clear and consistent view of the business performance of the Group and its operating divisions.
When applicable, these items include amortisation of acquisition intangibles, impairment of goodwill and other assets, the profit or loss on disposals of businesses or other significant fixed assets, costs of acquiring and integrating acquisitions, the cost of any fundamental restructuring of a business, material claims and settlements, significant recycling of amounts from equity to the income statement and unrealised gains losses on financial assets liabilities.

Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 73 Notes to the financial statements 6 Taxation Accounting policy Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the same primary statement as the accounting transaction to which it relates.
Current tax Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax issues based on estimates of the additional taxes that are likely to become due.
Amounts are accrued based on managements interpretation of specific tax law and the likelihood of settlement.
Where the outcome of discussions with tax authorities is different from the amount initially recorded, this difference will impact the tax provisions in the period the determination is made.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, except for: t initial recognition of goodwill: t the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit: and t differences relating to investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interest in joint ventures, the reversal of which is under the control of the Group and where it is probable that the difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date when the asset is realised or the liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets and they relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different taxable entities which intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Any additional income taxes that arise from the distribution of dividends are recognised at the same time as the liability to pay the related dividend.
Tax expense Intertek is a global business and operates across many different tax jurisdictions.
Income and profits are earned and taxed in the individual countries in which they occur.
The income tax expense for the total profit before tax for the year end 31 December 2011 is 61.9m 2010: 50.9m.
The Groups consolidated effective tax rate for the year ended 31 December 2011 is 29.1% 2010: 26.8%.
The income tax expense for the adjusted profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2011 is 73.3m 2010: 56.6m.
The Groups adjusted consolidated effective tax rate for the 12 months ended 31 December 2011 is 28.2% 2010: 26.7%.
Differences between the consolidated effective tax rate of 29.1% and the notional statutory UK rate of 26.5% include, but are not limited to: the mix of profits, the effect of tax rates in foreign jurisdictions, non deductible expenses, the effect of utilised tax losses and under over provisions in previous periods.
com Notes to the financial statements 6 Taxation continued Tax charge The total income tax charge, comprising the current tax charge and the movement in deferred tax, recognised in the income statement is analysed as follows: 2011 2010 m m UK corporation tax at 26.5% 2010: 28.0% 3.5 2.6 Double taxation relief 3.5 3.1 UK taxation 0.5 Overseas taxation 70.6 54.3 Adjustments relating to prior year liabilities 4.0 0.8 Current tax 66.6 54.6 Deferred tax origination and reversal of temporary differences 4.7 3.7 Total tax in income statement 61.9 50.9 Tax on adjusted result 73.3 56.6 Tax on separately disclosed items 11.4 5.7 Total tax in income statement 61.9 50.9 Reconciliation of effective tax rate The following table provides a reconciliation of the UK statutory corporation tax rate to the effective tax rate of the Group on profit before taxation.

The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK corporation tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011.
A further 1% reduction to the UK corporation tax rate was announced in the Budget on 29 March 2011.
The reduction in the UK corporation tax rate to 26% was enacted on 5 July 2011 and was effective from 1 April 2011, and the further reduction to 25% was enacted on 27 July 2011 and is effective from 1 April 2012.
Income tax recognised in other comprehensive income As noted in the accounting policy, tax is recognised in the same place as the relevant accounting charge.

com Notes to the financial statements 6 Taxation continued Unrecognised deferred tax assets Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: 2011 2010 m m Deductible temporary differences 13.5 13.3 Pensions 3.0 3.4 Tax losses 45.7 46.3 Property, fixtures, fittings and equipment 25.9 20.8 Equity-settled transactions 3.0 5.0 Total 91.1 88.8 The 2010 comparative figures have been restated to show the gross amount of unrecognised temporary differences, as these were previously stated as deferred tax asset amounts in 2010.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the Group can utilise the benefits from them.
There is a temporary difference of 174.7m 2010: 172.8m which relates to unremitted post-acquisition overseas earnings.
No deferred tax is provided on this amount as the distribution of these retained earnings is under the control of the Group and there is no intention to either repatriate from or sell the associated subsidiaries in the foreseeable future.
7 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
In addition to the earnings per share required by IAS 33: Earnings Per Share, an adjusted earnings per share has also been calculated and is based on earnings excluding the effect of amortisation of acquisition intangibles, goodwill impairment and other separately disclosed items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders a better understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
Details of the adjusted earnings per share are set out below: 2011 2010 m m Profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 138.8 128.6 Separately disclosed items after tax note 3 35.7 16.3 Adjusted earnings 174.5 144.9 Number of shares millions Basic weighted average number of ordinary shares 159.9 159.3 Potentially dilutive share awards 2.9 2.8 Diluted weighted average number of shares 162.8 162.1 Basic earnings per share 86.8p 80.7p Potentially dilutive share awards 1.5 p 1.4 p Diluted earnings per share 85.3p 79.3p Adjusted basic earnings per share 109.1p 91.0p Potentially dilutive share awards 1.9 p 1.6 p Adjusted diluted earnings per share 107.2p 89.4p Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 77 Notes to the financial statements 8 Property, plant and equipment Accounting policy Property, plant and equipment Owned assets Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset.
Gains and losses on disposal of items of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and are recognised in the income statement.
Leased assets Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Where land and buildings are held under finance leases, the accounting treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings.
Leased assets acquired by way of finance leases are stated at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Other leases are operating leases.
These leased assets are not recognised in the Groups statement of financial position.
Depreciation Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment.
Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold buildings Term of lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 10 years Depreciation methods, residual values and the useful lives of all assets are re-assessed at each reporting date.
Impairment Non-financial assets The carrying amounts of the Groups non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, then the assets recoverable amount is estimated to determine the level of any impairment.

9 Goodwill and other intangible assets Accounting policy Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of acquisition and the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units CGUs and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
Acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010 From 1 January 2010, the Group has applied IFRS 3 Business Combinations revised 2008.
The change in accounting policy has been applied prospectively.
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is obtained.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group measures goodwill as the fair value of the consideration transferred including the fair value of any previously-held equity interest in the acquiree and the recognised amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree, less the net recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, all measured as of the acquisition date.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Costs relating to acquisitions are shown in separately disclosed items.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date with subsequent changes recognised in profit or loss.
If at the reporting date the fair values of the acquirees identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities can only be established provisionally, then these values are used.
Adjustments to the fair values can be made within 12 months of the acquisition date and are taken as adjustments to goodwill.
Acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009 For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Groups interest in the recognised amount generally fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquiree.
When the excess was negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred in connection with business combinations were capitalised as part of the cost of the acquisition.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption permitted by IFRS 1 and has not restated goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill represents the amount recognised under the Groups previous accounting framework.
com Notes to the financial statements 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued Other intangible assets When the Group makes an acquisition, management review the business and assets acquired to determine whether any intangible assets should be recognised separately from goodwill.
If, based on managements judgement, such an asset is identified, then it is valued by discounting the probable future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset, over the estimated life of the asset.
Where there is uncertainty over the amount of economic benefit and the useful life, this is factored into the calculation.
Intangible assets arising on acquisitions and computer software are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Identifiable intangibles are those which can be sold separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, and which have finite useful lives.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives.
The estimated useful lives are as follows: Computer software Up to 7 years Customer relationships Up to 10 years Know-how Up to 5 years Licences Contractual life Covenants not to compete Contractual life Impairment Goodwill is not subject to amortisation and is tested annually for impairment and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Other intangible assets are subject to amortisation and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the amount carried in the statement of financial position is less than its recoverable amount.
Any impairment is recognised in the income statement.
Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each asset or cash generating unit or group of cash generating units to which the goodwill relates.
Assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows a cash generating unit or CGU.
The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash generating unit is the greater of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
The estimation process is complex due to the inherent risks and uncertainties and if different estimates were used this could materially change the projected value of the cash flows.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed.
An impairment loss in respect of other assets is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
The average remaining amortisation period for customer relationships is nine years 2010: three years.
Computer software net book value of 15.9m at 31 December 2011 2010: 14.0m includes software in construction of 4.8m 2010: 3.2m.

In order to determine whether impairments are required the Group estimates the recoverable amount of each CGU.
The calculation is based on projecting future cash flows over a five year period and using a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter.
The terminal value is calculated using a perpetuity model which assumes long term growth rates of operating cash flows of between 2.5% to 3.9% 2010: 2.5% to 4.1% reflecting the long term GDP growth forecasts in the various regions in which the respective CGUs operate.
A discount factor is applied to obtain a value in use which is the recoverable amount, unless the fair value less costs to sell the respective CGU is an amount in excess of the value in use.
The value in use calculation includes estimates about the future financial performance of the CGUs.
The approved Group Business Plans for the 3 years 2012 to 2014 form the basis for the cash flow projections for each CGU.
The cash flow projections for the succeeding 2 years 2015 to 2016 reflect managements conservative expectations of the medium term operating performance of the CGUs and growth prospects in the various CGUs markets and regions.
Key assumptions The key assumptions in the value in use calculations are the revenue and operating margin growth rates which directly influence the forecasted operating cash flows, as well as the discount rate applied.
In determining the key assumptions, management have taken into account the current economic climate and the resulting impact on expected growth and discount rates.
The calculation of the value in use is sensitive to the following key assumptions: Operating cash flow One of the key drivers of the operating cash flow is revenue.
The 2012 to 2014 revenues for each CGU are based on the approved business plans.
For the years 2015 and 2016, the likely organic growth rates were assessed for each region in the CGU, taking account of past experience and GDP growth prospects.
The compound annual growth rates for each CGU ranged from 7.3% to 16.8% 2010: 8.3% to 13.9%.
In all cases it is considered the assumed growth rates are realistic.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 83 Notes to the financial statements 9 Goodwill and other intangible assets continued The other key driver of the operating cash flow is operating profit.
The compound annual growth rates, which are considered realistic, ranged from 6.8% to 23.9% 2010: 7.6% to 22.1% reflecting management assessment of current and future market environment of the sectors and countries in which the CGUs operate.
Discount rate applied The discount rate applied to a CGU represents a pre tax rate that reflects the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted for the risks specific to the CGU.
The discount rates applied to the CGU were in the range of 9.1% to 12.7% 2010: 9.8% to 14.3%.
Sensitivity analysis There are no realistic changes that could be made to the key assumptions that would cause the carrying amount of each CGU to exceed its recoverable amount.
Management have also considered the effect of the following scenarios: i Assuming revenues decline each year by 1% in 2013 to 2016 from the 2012 budgeted revenues, with margins increasing with base assumptions, all CGUs continue to show sufficient headroom.
ii Assuming zero growth in operating profit margins in 2013 to 2016, with revenues increasing per base assumptions, all CGUs continue to show sufficient headroom.
iii Assuming an increase in the discount rates used by 1%, all CGUs continue to show sufficient headroom.
Management consider that the likelihood of any or all of the above scenarios occurring is low.
10 Acquisitions Acquisitions in 2011 Moody International On 27 April 2011, the Group acquired 100% of the equity of Moody comprising Moody International Holdings Limited, Inspection Services US Inc and Inspection Services Italy SRL for a cash consideration of 449.9m, on a cash and debt free basis.

11 Trade and other receivables Accounting policy Trade receivables are recognised initially at the value of the invoice sent to the customer and subsequently at the amounts considered recoverable amortised cost.
Estimates are used in determining the level of receivables that will not, in the opinion of the Directors, be collected.
Based on historic default rates, reflecting the track record of payments by the Groups customers, the Group believes that no impairment allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables which are less than six months outstanding, unless there are specific circumstances such as the bankruptcy of a customer which would render the trade receivable irrecoverable.
The Group provides fully for all trade receivables over 12 months old as these are considered likely to be irrecoverable.
Where recovery is in doubt, a provision is made against the specific trade receivable until such time as the Group believes the amount to be irrecoverable.
At that time the trade receivable is written off.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are analysed below: 2011 2010 m m Trade receivables 320.6 235.7 Other receivables 50.9 38.1 Prepayments and accrued income 71.1 41.4 Total trade and other receivables 442.6 315.2 Trade receivables are shown net of an allowance for impairment losses of 15.4m 2010: 10.3m and are all expected to be recovered within 12 months.
Impairment on trade receivables charged as part of operating costs was 6.1m 2010: 4.8m and a fair value adjustment of 3.4m was made in relation to the acquisition of Moody.
There is no material difference between the above amounts for trade and other receivables and their fair value, due to their short-term duration.
There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables as the Group has a large number of customers who are internationally dispersed.
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Under 3 months 272.0 205.2 Between 3 and 6 months 34.8 21.8 Between 6 and 12 months 17.1 11.7 Over 12 months 12.1 7.3 Gross trade receivables 336.0 246.0 Allowance for impairment 15.4 10.3 Trade receivables, net of allowance 320.6 235.7 Included in trade receivables under three months of 272.0m 2010: 205.2m are trade receivables of 151.2m 2010: 118.2m which are not yet due for payment under the Groups standard terms and conditions of sale.

From time-to-time the Group is involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business.
The outcome of such litigation and the timing of any potential liability cannot be readily foreseen, as it is often subject to legal proceedings.
Based on information currently available, the Directors consider that the cost to the Group of an unfavourable outcome arising from such litigation is unlikely to have a materially adverse effect on the financial position of the Group in the foreseeable future.
com Notes to the financial statements 13 Provisions continued The provision for claims of 6.1m 2010: 17.9m represents an estimate of the amounts payable in connection with identified claims from customers, former employees and other plaintiffs and associated legal costs.
The timing of the cash outflow relating to the provisions is uncertain but is likely to be within one year.
Details of contingent liabilities in respect of claims are set out in note 22.
The other provision of 10.5m 2010: 4.0m includes restructuring provisions, onerous contracts and acquisition integration costs.
14 Borrowings and financial instruments Financial instruments Accounting policy Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest expense on borrowings, facility fees, interest receivable on funds invested, net foreign exchange gains or losses, interest income and expense relating to pension assets and liabilities and gains and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they accrue using the effective interest rate method.
Loans and receivables Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.
Loans and receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost less impairment losses including bad debt provision.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Net debt comprises borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Non-derivative financial liabilities Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently are stated at their amortised cost.
Interest-bearing borrowings are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, interestbearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest basis.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments, including interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts, to hedge economically its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value: attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss when incurred.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value at each period end is recognised immediately in the income statement except where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date, being the present value of the difference between the quoted forward price and the exercise price of the contract.
Hedging Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used economically to hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement in the same caption as the foreign exchange on the related item.
Hedge of net investment in a foreign operation The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The Group has external borrowings denominated in foreign currencies which are used to hedge the net investment in its foreign operations.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 89 Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Impairment A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired.
A financial asset is considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount, and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the original effective interest rate.
All impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.

com Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Financial risks Details of the Groups treasury controls, exposures and the policies and processes for managing capital and credit, liquidity, interest rate and currency risk are set out below, in the Directors Report Financial Review that starts on page 24 and Principal Risks and Uncertainties on pages 45 to 47. Credit risk Exposure to credit risk Credit risks arise mainly from the possibility that customers may not be able to settle their obligations as agreed.
The Group monitors the creditworthiness of customers on an ongoing basis.
The Groups credit risk is diversified due to the large number of entities, industries and regions that make up the Groups customer base.
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.
At the reporting date this was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Trade receivables, net of allowance 320.6 235.7 Cash and cash equivalents 181.9 217.0 Total 502.5 452.7 The maximum exposure to credit risk for trade receivables at the reporting date by geographic region was as follows: 2011 2010 m m Americas 105.7 74.8 Europe, Middle East and Africa 124.1 85.9 Asia Pacific 90.8 75.0 Total 320.6 235.7 Counterparty risk Cash and cash equivalents and available borrowing facilities are at risk in the event that the counterparty is not able to meet its obligations in regards to the cash held or facilities available to the Group.
The Group also enters into transactions with counterparties in relation to derivative financial instruments.
If the counterparty was not able to meet its obligations, the Group may be exposed to additional foreign currency or interest rate risk.
The Group, wherever possible, enters into arrangements with counterparties who have robust credit standing, which the Group defines as a financial institution with a credit rating of at least A-.
The Group has existing banking relationships with a number of relationship banks that meet this criterion, and seeks to use their services wherever possible while avoiding excessive concentration of credit risk.
Given the diverse geographic nature of the Groups activities, it is not always possible to use a relationship bank.
Therefore the Group has set limits on the level of deposits to be held at non-relationship banks to minimise the risk to the Group.
It is also Group policy to remit any excess funds from local entities back to Group Treasury in the UK.
Given the controls in place, and based on a current assessment of our banking relationships, management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 93 Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its obligations as and when they fall due.
The Groups policy is to: t ensure sufficient liquidity is available to Group companies in the amounts, currencies and locations required to support the Groups operations: t ensure the Group has adequate available sources of funding to protect against unforeseen internal and external events: and t avoid excess liquidity which restricts growth and impacts the cost of financing.
To ensure this policy is met, the Group monitors cash balances on a daily basis, projects cash requirements on a rolling basis and funds itself using debt instruments with a range of maturities.
The following are the contractual cash flows of financial liabilities including interest for floating rate instruments, interest payments are based on the interest rate at 31 December 2011 : Carrying Contractual Six months 6-12 More than amount cash flows or less months 1-2 years 2-5 years five years 2011 m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Senior term loans and notes 760.4 871.3 13.5 44.8 135.4 499.4 178.2 Other loans 2.2 2.2 2.2 Trade payables 52.7 52.7 51.8 0.9 815.3 926.2 65.3 45.7 137.6 499.4 178.2 Derivative financial liabilities Forward exchange contracts: Outflow 73.0 73.0 Inflow 73.0 73.0 Total 815.3 926.2 65.3 45.7 137.6 499.4 178.2 Carrying Contractual Six months 6-12 More than amount cash flows or less months 1-2 years 2-5 years five years 2010 m m m m m m m Non-derivative financial liabilities Senior term loans and notes 383.6 477.6 7.5 101.1 14.5 119.8 234.7 Other loans 3.1 4.0 0.1 0.1 0.2 3.0 0.6 Trade payables 36.7 36.7 36.7 423.4 518.3 44.3 101.2 14.7 122.8 235.3 Derivative financial liabilities Interest rate swaps used for hedging 1.0 1.0 0.8 0.2 Forward exchange contracts: Outflow 34.2 34.2 Inflow 34.2 34.2 1.0 1.0 0.8 0.2 Total 424.4 519.3 45.1 101.4 14.7 122.8 235.3 94m of the senior term loan contractually liable to be repaid in six to twelve months was repaid in February 2011.
Interest rate risk The Groups objective is to manage the risk to the business from movements in interest rates, and to provide stability and predictability of the near term 12 month horizon interest expense.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is for the debt portfolio to include between 30% and 70% of fixed rate debt.
To do this the Group uses hedging instruments where considered appropriate.
com Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Hedging During 2010 and 2011 the Group entered into swaps to maintain an appropriate level of fixed and floating rate interest payments.
Under the interest rate swap agreements, the Group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
During 2011 the Group held a number of fixed rate interest rate swaps, where the Group paid a fixed rate of interest, ranging from 0.3% to 3.8% 2010: 3.5% to 3.8% and received a floating rate of interest based on LIBOR.
These swaps matured before year end.
These swaps had a notional contract value of 64.6m at 31 December 2010.
The net fair value of these swaps at 31 December 2010 was a liability of 1.0m.
Sensitivity At 31 December 2011, it is estimated that a general increase of 3% in interest rates would decrease the Groups profit before tax by approximately 9.4m 2010: 0.4m.
Interest rate swaps have been included in this calculation.
This analysis assumes all other variables remain constant.
Foreign currency risk The Groups objective in managing foreign currency risk is to safeguard the Groups financial assets from economic loss due to fluctuations in foreign currencies, and to protect margins on cross currency contracts and operations.
To achieve this, the Groups policy is to hedge its foreign currency exposures where appropriate.
The net assets of foreign subsidiaries represent a significant portion of the Groups shareholders funds and a substantial percentage of the Groups revenue and operating costs are incurred in currencies other than sterling.
Because of the high proportion of international activity, the Groups profit is exposed to exchange rate fluctuations.
Two types of risk arise as a result: i translation risk, that is, the risk of adverse currency fluctuations in the translation of foreign currency operations and foreign assets and liabilities into sterling and ii transaction risk, that is, the risk that currency fluctuations will have a negative effect on the value of the Groups commercial cash flows in various currencies.
The foreign currency profile of cash, trade receivables and payables at the reporting date were as follows: Carrying Chinese Hong Kong Other amount Sterling US dollar renminbi dollar Euro currencies 2011 m m m m m m m Cash 181.9 17.4 17.3 66.2 6.8 5.8 68.4 Trade receivables 320.6 35.9 92.0 28.0 9.5 38.2 117.0 Trade payables 52.7 12.5 8.0 2.9 2.1 10.5 16.7 2010 Cash 217.0 4.0 112.5 52.6 2.7 10.6 34.6 Trade receivables 235.7 25.8 65.2 23.6 9.4 32.8 78.9 Trade payables 36.7 9.1 6.2 2.5 1.5 7.7 9.7 Recognised assets and liabilities Changes in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts that economically hedge monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and for which no hedge accounting is applied are recognised in the income statement.
Hedge of net investment in foreign subsidiaries The Groups foreign currency denominated loans are designated as a hedge of the Groups investment in its respective subsidiaries.
The carrying amount of these loans at 31 December 2011 was 757.6m 2010: 383.6m.
A foreign exchange loss of 21.5m 2010: loss of 6.3m was recognised in the translation reserve in equity on translation of these loans to sterling.
Sensitivity It is estimated that a general increase of 10% in the value of sterling against the US dollar the main currency impacting the Group would have decreased the Groups profit before tax for 2011 by approximately 13.4m 2010: 13.8m.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 95 Notes to the financial statements 14 Borrowings and financial instruments continued Fair values The table below sets out a comparison of the book values and corresponding fair values of all the Groups financial instruments byclass.

Interest rate swaps Bank valuations are used to estimate the fair value of interest rate swaps.
Valuations are tested by considering the equivalent swap rate as at 31 December and calculating the difference in interest earned at this rate compared to the original swap rates.
Interest bearing loans and borrowings The fair value of the floating interest bearing loans and borrowings is equal to the book value, since the floating interest rates were reset just prior to the year end.
The fair value of the fixed interest bearing loans and borrowings has been calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows discounted at the market rate at the reporting date.
Trade receivables and payables For trade receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
All others are estimated as the present value of future cash flows discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date.

This dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and therefore, in accordance with IAS 10: Events after the reporting date, it has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
If approved, the final dividend will be paid to shareholders on 22 June 2012.
Reserves Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises foreign currency differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations as well as the translation of liabilities that hedge the Groups net investment in foreign operations.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of the cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Other This relates to a merger difference that arose in 2002 on the conversion of share warrants into share capital.
16 Employee benefits Accounting policy Pension schemes Defined contribution plans A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which an entity pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts.
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an employee benefit expense in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans A defined benefit plan is a post-employment benefit plan other than a defined contribution plan.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior years: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value.
Any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
Intertek Annual Report 2011 | 97 Notes to the financial statements 16 Employee benefits continued In calculating the defined benefit deficit, the discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit-rated bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations and that are denominated in the same currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid.
The calculation is performed annually by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of economic benefits available in the form of: i an unconditional right to a refund from the plan: or ii reductions in future contributions to the plan as measured by the estimated future service cost less the estimated minimum funding contributions required in respect of the future accrual of benefits in that year.
An economic benefit is available to the Group if it is realisable during the life of the plan, or on settlement of the plan liabilities.
In addition a provision for future minimum funding contributions is recorded to the extent that such payments are required to cover an existing shortfall, as measured on a minimum funding contribution basis, and having been paid will not be available as a refund or a reduction in future contributions to the plan.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities expected to arise from the employees services in the accounting period is charged to the operating profit in the income statement.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the interest on the present value of the schemes liabilities, during the accounting period, are shown as finance income and finance expense respectively.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
In most locations, these are defined contribution arrangements.
However, there are significant defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Switzerland.
These are funded schemes, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
