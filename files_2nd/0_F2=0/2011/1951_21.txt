Special business Four resolutions will be proposed as special business at the forthcoming AGM.
The effect of these resolutions is as follows: Resolution 12 Authority to directors to issue shares This is an ordinary resolution which authorises the directors to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 5,035,348, which is equivalent to approximately one-third of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 17 October 2011, and also gives the directors authority toallot, by way of rights issue only, ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of 10,070,696 which is equivalent to approximately two-thirds of the Companys issued ordinary share capital as at 17 October 2011, such authority, if granted, to expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2013.
As at 17 October 2011 the Company held no shares as treasury shares.
At present, the directors only intend to use this authority to satisfy the exercise of awards under the Companys share schemes.
The directors wish to obtain the necessary authority from shareholders so that allotments can be made if required and if suitable market conditions arise at short notice and without the need to convene a general meeting of the Company which would be both costly and time consuming.
Resolution 13 Disapplication of pre-emption rights This is a special resolution and is the customary annual request, in substitution for the authority granted to the directors by shareholders on 7 January 2011 which expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM, that shareholders empower the directors to allot ordinary shares for cash without first offering them pro rata to existing shareholders as would otherwise be required by section 561 of the Companies Act 2006 a in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer and b otherwise than in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive offer up to an aggregate nominal value of 755,302, being approximately equal to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 17 October 2011.
Resolution 14 Companys purchase of its own shares The Companys authority to purchase its own ordinary and preference shares, given at the last AGM, expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
This authority was not used during the year.
The directors propose, as a special resolution, that it should be renewed for a further year to expire on the date of the 2013 AGM.
The directors will review opportunities to use this authority in light of stock market conditions and trading opportunities during the year.
The directors will only make purchases which will reduce the number of shares in issue after paying due attention to the effect on the financing of the Group, its assets and earnings per share for the remaining shareholders.
Any shares purchased under this authority may be cancelled in which case the number of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly or may be held in treasury.
Resolution 15 Length of notice of meeting Shareholder approval for general meetings of the Company other than AGMs to be held on 14 days notice, given at the last AGM, expires at the conclusion of the forthcoming AGM.
There is no current intention to use this authority and the Company will only consider using this authority where it is considered that this would be for the benefit of shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation Your directors consider each of the resolutions set out in the Notice of AGM to be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
Accordingly, they unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings.
