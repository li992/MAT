Deferred tax Deferred income taxes are calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using local substantively enacted tax rates.
The gross movement on the deferred income tax account is as follows: 2011 2010 m m At 1 January asset 23.5 39.0 Income statement charge note 10 1.6 1.9 Acquisitions 10.8 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income note 10 26.5 14.1 Exchange differences 0.3 0.5 At 31 December asset 5.9 23.5 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year was as follows: Temporary Share-based differences payment and Retirement Derivative Other on assets employee benefit financial temporary intangibles benefits schemes instruments differences Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2011 17.3 27.1 13.5 0.3 0.1 23.5 Credited charged to income statement 6.8 2.2 0.7 6.9 1.6 Acquisitions 16.7 1.4 26.1 10.8 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income 2.6 32.7 8.8 26.5 Exchange differences 1.6 0.1 2.0 0.3 At 31 December 2011 25.6 23.8 18.5 9.1 17.1 5.9 The movement in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the previous year was as follows: Temporary Share-based differences payment and Retirement Derivative Other on assets employee benefit financial temporary intangibles benefits schemes instruments differences Total m m m m m m At 1 January 2010 22.6 17.8 25.4 1.0 17.4 39.0 Credited charged to income statement 5.6 8.7 2.1 0.1 18.2 1.9 Items recognised in equity and in other comprehensive income 0.5 14.0 0.6 14.1 Exchange differences 0.3 0.1 0.7 0.5 At 31 December 2010 17.3 27.1 13.5 0.3 0.1 23.5 Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes relate to the same fiscal authority.
The following is the analysis of the deferred tax balances after offset for financial reporting purposes: 2011 2010 m m Deferred tax liabilities 22.3 14.6 Deferred tax assets 28.2 38.1 5.9 23.5 At the balance sheet date, the Group did not recognise deferred tax assets of 10.2m 2010: 9.7m which principally relate to unused tax losses of 34.9m 2010: 31.8m.
Losses of 4.5m 2010: 1.3m expire within five years, losses of 17.2m 2010: 11.0m expire within 6-10 years, losses of nil 2010: 12.6m expire within 15-20 years and losses of 13.2m 2010: 6.9m may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was 0.1m 2010: 0.1m.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
