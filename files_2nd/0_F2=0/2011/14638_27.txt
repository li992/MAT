Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The Parent Company and consolidated accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB that have been adopted by the European Union EU.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experiences and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
As further explained below, the most significant effect on the financial statements from accounting policies requiring judgement are in the areas of research and development R&D, and revenue.
The major judgements made in respect of R&D are those in assessing whether an intangible asset arises from the development phase of a product development project, ie: i The technical feasibility of completing the product so it will be ready for sale ii The market for the product and the future sales that the product will generate iii Assessing the costs directly attributable to the individual product during its development.
The Group has a very wide product range and the general nature of product development is that of a number of modest sized projects.
The value of capitalised development costs is disclosed in note 13.
The judgements used in respect of revenue are explained in the revenue accounting policy on page 61 below.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
The key areas where estimates have been used and assumptions applied are in provisions, impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets, and in assessing the defined benefit pension scheme liabilities.
More details of the estimates used and assumptions applied in relation to impairment testing of goodwill and intangible assets are given in note 13 and those in relation to assessing defined benefit scheme liabilities in note 28.
The Group has considerable financial resources together with a diverse range of products and customers across wide geographic areas and industries.
As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the current uncertain economic outlook.
Further information on the Groups business activities, performance and position, together with the financial position of the Group, its capital structure and cash flow are included in the business review and financial review on pages 16 to 25.
In addition, note 32 to the financial statements discloses details of the Groups financial risk management and credit facilities.
The consolidated accounts are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional currency, rounded to the nearest thousand.
There were no revisions to adopted IFRS that became applicable in 2011 which had a significant impact on the Groups financial statements.
Standards and interpretations issued by the IASB are only applicable if endorsed by the EU.
If endorsed, amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits will require the financing on post-retirement benefits to be calculated on the net surplus or deficit using an AA corporate bond rate.
This will increase the net post-retirement scheme financing cost.
This will be effective for 2013.
The Group does not consider that any other standards, amendments or interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet applicable, will have a significant impact on the financial statements.
Basis of accounting i Subsidiaries The Group accounts include the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group.
Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing control, potential voting rights that presently are exercisable or convertible are taken into account.
The accounts of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Associates Associates are those entities for which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The accounts include the Groups share of the total recognised income and expense of associates on an equity accounted basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date that significant influence ceases.
iii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances, and any unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the accounts.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates are eliminated to the extent of the Groups interest in the entity.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 59 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued iv Company Under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own income statement.
Foreign currency i On consolidation The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The revenues, expenses and cash flows of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
Where the notes to the Group accounts include tables reconciling movements between opening and closing balances, assets and liabilities are translated at balance sheet rates and revenue and expenses are translated at average rates with the exchange differences arising being disclosed separately.
This presentation is a change from last year and therefore some minor restatements have been made to comparative tables to achieve consistent disclosure.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign operations are taken to a separate translation reserve within equity.
They are recycled and recognised in the income statement upon disposal of the operation.
In respect of all foreign operations, any differences that have arisen before 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are not presented as a separate component of equity.
ii Foreign currency transactions Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective currencies of the Group entities at the foreign exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates fair value was determined.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a highly probable forecasted transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the Cash flow hedge reserve.
The associated gain or loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement in the period in which the transaction to which it relates occurs.
Property, plant and equipment Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost or deemed cost, less accumulated depreciation.
Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1st January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis at rates which write down the value of assets to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The principal rates are as follows: Freehold buildings 1.5% Office furniture and fittings 10% Motor vehicles 20% Plant and machinery 10-12.5% Office equipment 12.5-33.3% Tooling and patterns 10% The depreciation rates are reassessed annually.
Intangible assets i Goodwill All business combinations after 1st January 2004 are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment see note 13 for more detail.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1st January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice GAAP.
ii R&D Expenditure on R&D is charged to the income statement in the period in which it is incurred except that, development expenditure is capitalised where the development costs relate to new or substantially improved products that are subsequently to be released for sale and will generate future economic benefits.
The expenditure capitalised includes staff costs and related expenses.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
iii Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and any impairment losses.
Annual impairment tests are performed on acquired intangible assets by comparing the carrying value with the recoverable amount, being the higher of the fair value less cost to sell and value in use, discounted at an appropriate discount rate, of future cash flows in respect of intangible assets for the relevant cash generating unit.
More detail is given in note 13.
60 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 1 Accounting policies continued iv Amortisation Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from the date they are available for use.
Goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment annually.
The principal amortisation rates are as follows: Capitalised development costs 20% Manufacturing designs and core technology 10% ERP systems and software 12.5-20% Non compete undertakings 50% Customer relationships 20% Brand names and trademarks 10-20% Inventories Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of inventories includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition.
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost includes an appropriate share of production overheads based on normal operating capacity.
Cost also includes transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of inventories.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the cash flow statements.
Going concern The statement on the going concern assumption is included within corporate governance on page 42.
Employee benefits i Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit plans The costs of providing pensions under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and spread over the period during which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees services.
The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pensions is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
That benefit is discounted at rates reflecting the yields on AA credit rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations to determine its present value.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses, differences between the expected and actual returns, and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the year they arise.
Any scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit is recognised in full in the balance sheet.
The cost of other post-employment liabilities are calculated in a similar way to defined benefit pension schemes and spread over the period which benefit is expected to be derived from the employees services, in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
iii Employee share plans Incentives in the form of shares are provided to employees under share option and share award schemes.
The fair value of these options and awards at their date of grant is charged to the income statement over the relevant vesting periods with a corresponding increase in equity.
The value of the charge is adjusted to reflect expected and actual levels of options and share awards vesting.
iv Long-term share incentive plans The fair value of awards is measured at the date of grant and the cost spread over the vesting period.
The amount recognised as an expense is not adjusted to reflect market based performance conditions, but is adjusted for non-market based performance conditions.
Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods and service contracts is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer.
Revenue from projects is recognised as income in proportion to the stage of completion of the transaction at the balance sheet date.
Judgements can be required to assess the stage of completion, although in the vast majority of projects the position is relatively easy to identify.
Projects where a stage of completion assessment is needed typically involve the sale of products, installation and commissioning, which are usually separately identified elements in the project order.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due or associated costs, or there is the possibility of return of the goods.
No revenue is recognised if there is significant continuing management involvement with the goods.
Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 61 Notes to the accounts continued 1 Accounting policies continued As soon as the outcome of a project or service contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the project or service contract.
An expected loss on a project or service contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Leases i Operating leases Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
ii Finance leases Leases where the Group assumes substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases as if the asset had been purchased outright.
Assets acquired under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group and the capital and interest elements of the leasing commitments are shown as obligations in creditors.
Depreciation is charged on a consistent basis with similar owned assets or over the lease term if shorter.
The interest element of the lease payment is charged to the income statement on a basis which produces a consistent rate of charge over the period of the liability.
Taxation The tax charge comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax expense is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income, when it is also recognised in equity or other comprehensive income respectively.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the profit for the year and any adjustments in respect of previous years using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets and liabilities, and their carrying amounts in the accounts.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is provided using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date or the date that the temporary differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
Share capital When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a deduction from equity.
Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented as a deduction from total equity.
Share options granted to subsidiary employees The Parent Company grants share options over its own Ordinary shares directly to employees of subsidiary companies.
These employees provide services to the subsidiary companies.
The cost of these shares is not recharged and therefore the fair value of the share options granted is recognised as a capital contribution to the subsidiary companies.
This is accounted for as an increase in investments with a corresponding increase in a non-distributable component of equity.
2 Segmental reporting As required by IFRS 8, Operating Segments, the following segmental information is presented in a consistent format with management information considered by the Board.

76 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 28 Employee benefits Pension plans The Group The Group is accounting for pension costs in accordance with International Accounting Standard 19.
The disclosures shown here are in respect of the Groups Defined Benefit Obligations.
Other plans operated by the Group were either Defined Contribution plans or were deemed immaterial for the purposes of IAS 19 reporting.
The total expense relating to the Groups Defined Contribution pension plans in the current year was 6,809,000 2010: 5,546,000.
Of the Defined Benefit plans, the plans in the UK and USA hold most of the liability.
The post-retirement mortality assumptions in respect of these plans may therefore be considered material.
The main UK scheme assumes that postretirement mortality follows the SAPS standard tables, with improvements based on the 2009 CMI Core Projections with a 1.5% long-term trend.
This basis gives a life expectancy of 23 years and 25 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.
These figures reflect the generally recognised trend of increased longevity.
The USA schemes use the RP-2000 BC mortality table with AA scale projected for 12 years.
Life expectancy under this table is 18 years and 20 years respectively for a male and female currently aged 65.
These assumptions are regularly reviewed in light of scheme specific experience and more widely available statistics.
The financial assumptions used at 31st December were: Assumptions weighted by value of liabilities % per annum Overseas pensions and UK pensions medical 2011 2010 2011 2010 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 4.1 3.3 3.1 Rate of increase in pensions 2.9 3.4 1.6 1.7 Rate of price inflation 3.1 3.5 2.7 2.0 Discount rate 5.0 5.5 4.4 5.2 Medical trend rate 5.0 5.0 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Awards are determined by the Remuneration Committee whose objective is to align the interests of employees with those of shareholders by giving an incentive linked to added shareholder value.
Options are subject to performance conditions, which if met make the options exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
For options granted from 1995 to 2001 the performance condition is an increase in EPS of more than 6% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a consecutive three-year period between grant and ten years from date of grant.
From and including the 2002 options the increase in EPS was revised to 9% greater than the increase in the UK Retail Price Index over a three-year consecutive period and from 2007 the performance condition needs to be met over the three-year period from 1st January prior to the date of the grant.
If the condition is not met at the end of the three-year period the option will lapse.
The share options granted have been measured by Towers Watson, using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.
The relevant disclosures in respect of the share option scheme grants are set out below.
The number of shares exercisable at 31st December 2011 is 355,290 2010: 324,721.
The weighted-average share price during the period was 18.74 2010: 15.46.
82 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 28 Employee benefits continued b Performance Share Plan Awards under the Performance Share Plan are made to Executive Directors and take the form of contingent rights to acquire shares, subject to the satisfaction of a performance target.
To the extent that they vest, awards may be satisfied in cash, in shares or an option over shares.
For awards granted up to 2007 the performance target is based on the Companys total shareholder return TSR relative to the TSR of other companies included in the FTSE All-Share Industrial Engineering Sector over a three-year performance period where awards will vest on a sliding scale.
All shares within an award will vest if the Companys TSR is at or above the upper quartile.
25% will vest if the TSR is at the median and the number of shares that will vest will be calculated pro-rata on a straight line basis between 25% and 100% if the Companys TSR falls between the median and the upper quartile.
No shares will vest if the Companys TSR is below the median.
The performance criteria for awards from 2008 onwards are split into two separate parts.
The vesting of the first part, amounting to 60% of the award, is based on the existing TSR measure.
The vesting of the second part, amounting to 40% of the award, is subject to achievement of a target based on aggregate EPS over a three-year performance period.
For the 2008 to 2010 awards, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to 5% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds 11%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.
For awards made in 2011, 25% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 3% and 100% will vest if the compound growth in EPS is equal to or exceeds the growth in the Retail Price Index plus 9%, there is pro-rata vesting for actual growth between these rates.

The aim of the ESOP is to encourage increased shareholding in the Company by all UK employees and so there are no performance conditions.
Employees are invited to join the ESOP when an offer is made each year.
Individuals save for 12 months during the accumulation period and subscribe for shares at the lower of the price at the beginning and the end of the accumulation period under HMRC rules.
The Company provides a matching share for each share purchased by the individual.
Shares issued under the ESOP have been measured by Towers Watson, using the Present Economic Value PEV valuation methodology.

Had the acquisitions all taken place on 1st January 2010 rather than the actual acquisition dates, the effect on the Group revenue and profit after tax would have been an increase of approximately 3,000,000 and 400,000 respectively.
32 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group does not enter into significant derivative transactions.
The Groups principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, cash and short-term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained fundamentally unchanged since the beginning of 2000. Credit risk The Group sells products and services to customers around the world and its customer base is varied in size and industry sector.
The Group operates credit control policies to assess customers credit ratings and provides for any debt that is identified as non-collectable.
Historically losses from trade receivables have been low.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows in desired currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest as appropriate to the purposes of the borrowing, depending on which gives best value.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, loans and finance leases as appropriate.
Foreign currency risk The Group has operations around the world and therefore its balance sheet can be affected significantly by movements in the rate of exchange between sterling and various other currencies particularly the US dollar and euro.
The Group seeks to mitigate the effect of this structural currency exposure by borrowing in these currencies where appropriate while maintaining a low cost of debt.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures principally as a result of trading between Group companies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases by an operating unit in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Net cash flows between any two currencies of less than 1 million per annum would not usually be considered sufficiently material to warrant forward cover.
Forward cover is not taken out more than 24 months in advance or for more than 90% of the next 12 months and 60% of the following 12 months forecast exposure.

Floating rate financial assets comprise cash placed on money market deposit mainly at call and three month rates.
The average rate of interest received on sterling deposits during the year was 0.75% 2010: 0.90%.
Currency exposures As explained above, the Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain a low cost of debt while partially hedging against currency depreciation.
All gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are dealt with in the statement of total comprehensive income.
Transactional or non-structural exposures give rise to net currency gains and losses that are recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures include the monetary assets and monetary liabilities in the Group balance sheet that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
At 31st December the currency exposures in respect of the euro was a net monetary liability of 1,121,000 2010 net monetary asset: 227,000 and in respect of the US dollar a net monetary asset of 6,533,000 2010: 9,185,000.
At 31st December the percentage of debt to net assets, excluding debt was 14.6% 2010: 6.5% for the euro and 1.0% 2010: 19.3% for the US dollar.

The forward contracts are designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedging relationship.
At 31st December the Group had contracts outstanding to purchase 1,020,000 with Japanese yen, 2,561,000 with euros, 9,222,000 with US dollars, 9,060,000 with US dollars, Swedish SEK19,693,000 with US dollars, Danish DKK7,192,000 with US dollars, 3,518,000 with Chinese RMB, 339,272 with Singapore dollars and 595,002 with Singapore dollars.
The fair values at the end of the reporting period were 27,059,000 2010: 8,250,000.
The fair value of cash flow hedges falls into the Level 2 category of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 7.
Borrowing facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: The Group 2011 2010 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 15,937 30,605 The Parent 2011 2010 000 000 Expiring in one year or less 7,427 19,889 92 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 32 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Fair values of financial assets and liabilities at 31st December are not materially different from book values due to their size or the fact that they were at short-term rates of interest.
Fair values have been assessed as follows: Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are marked to market using year-end exchange rates Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for homogeneous lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates Trade and other receivables payables For receivables payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
At 31st December, it is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would increase the Groups profit after tax and equity by approximately 150,000 2010: 220,000.
At the year-end borrowings totalled 47,903,000 consequently, in respect of financial liabilities, the Group is not significantly at risk from increases in interest rates.
For the year ended 31st December 2011, it is estimated that a decrease of one percentage point in the value of sterling weighted in relation to the Groups profit and trading flows has increased the Groups profit before tax by approximately 1,600,000 2010: 1,500,000.
The effect can be very different between years due to the weighting of different currency movements.
Forward exchange contracts have been included in this calculation.
The credit risk profile of trade receivables The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was: Gross Impairment Gross Impairment 2011 2011 2010 2010 Not past due date 104,038 539 107,219 280 0-30 days past due date 20,600 184 15,043 354 30 days 1 year past due date 21,795 3,226 19,977 4,255 More than one year 5,001 5,001 5,229 5,229 151,434 8,950 147,468 10,118 Based on past experience the Group believes no further impairment allowance is required for receivables that are past their due date.
The movement in the allowance for impairment in respect of trade receivables during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 Balance at 1st January 10,118 8,121 Movement in impairment 1,168 1,997 Balance at 31st December 8,950 10,118 Spirax-Sarco Engineering plc Annual Report and Accounts 2011 93
