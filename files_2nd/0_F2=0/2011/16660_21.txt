co. uk 57 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
GENERAL INFORMATION Cookson Group plc the Company is a public limited company registered in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.
The nature of the operations and principal activities of the Company and its subsidiary and joint venture companies the Group are set out in the Operating Review on pages 11 to 16 and its registered address is shown on page 107.
BASIS OF PREPARATION 2.1 BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union IFRS and, with the exception of defined benefits pension plans and derivative financial instruments, under the historical cost convention in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
2.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The consolidated financial statements of the Group incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries.
Control exists when the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
In assessing whether control exists, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are taken into account.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Group income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those detailed herein to ensure that the Group financial statements are prepared on a consistent basis.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in the net assets of consolidated subsidiaries are identified separately from the Groups interest therein.
Non-controlling interests consist of the amount of those interests at the date of the original business combination together with the non-controlling interests share of profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income since the date of the combination.
Total comprehensive income is attributed to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
2.3 GOING CONCERN As discussed in more detail in the Directors Report on page 32, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011.
2.4 FUNCTIONAL AND PRESENTATION CURRENCY The financial statements are presented in millions of pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and rounded to one decimal place.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 27.1.
2.5 DISCLOSURE OF EXCEPTIONAL ITEMS IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, provides no definitive guidance as to the format of the income statement, but states key lines which should be disclosed.
It also encourages the disclosure of additional line items and the reordering of items presented on the face of the income statement when appropriate for a proper understanding of the entitys financial performance.
In accordance with IAS 1, the Company has adopted a policy of disclosing separately on the face of its Group income statement the effect of any components of financial performance considered by the Directors to be exceptional, or for which separate disclosure would assist both in a better understanding of the financial performance achieved and in making projections of future results.
Both materiality and the nature and function of the components of income and expense are considered in deciding upon such presentation.
Such items may include, inter alia, amortisation charges relating to intangible assets, the financial effect of major restructuring activity, profits or losses relating to non-current assets, gains or losses relating to employee benefits plans, finance costs, profits or losses arising on business disposals, and other items, including the taxation impact of the aforementioned items, which have a significant impact on the Groups results either due to their size or nature.

BASIS OF PREPARATION CONTINUED 2.6 NEW AND REVISED IFRS During the year a number of amendments to IFRS became effective and were adopted by the Group, none of which had a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
A number of other new and amended IFRS were issued during the year which do not become effective until after 1 January 2012, none of which are likely to have a material impact on the Groups net cash flows, financial position, total comprehensive income or earnings per share.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY Determining the carrying amount of some assets and liabilities requires estimation of the effect of uncertain future events.
The major sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities are noted below.
3.1 GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS The Directors use their judgement to determine the extent to which goodwill and other capitalised intangible assets have a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, the Directors undertake an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill and other intangible assets.
In the assessment undertaken as at 31 December 2011, further details of which are given in note 18, value in use was derived from discounted five-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 2.5% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of the Groups businesses for this purpose.
Changes to the assumptions used in making these forecasts could significantly alter the Directors assessment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets.
3.2 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS The Groups financial statements include the costs and obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-retirement benefits to current and former employees.
It is the Directors responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
These assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans assets and liabilities.
Whilst the Directors believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the Groups profit and financial position.
3.3 LIABILITY RESERVES Cookson has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Groups subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
Reserves are made for the expected amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which reserve is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing and amount of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty.
The Directors use their judgement and experience to make reserves in the financial statements for an appropriate amount relating to such matters.
3.4 TAXATION a Current tax Tax benefits are not recognised unless it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits to the Group.
In assessing the amount of the benefit to be recognised in the financial statements, the Directors exercise their judgement in considering the effect of negotiations, litigation and any other matters that they consider may impact upon the potential settlement.
Any interest and penalties on tax liabilities are provided for in the tax charge.
The Group operates internationally and is subject to tax in many different jurisdictions.
As a consequence, the Group is routinely subject to tax audits and local enquiries which, by their very nature, can take a considerable period of time to conclude.
Provisions are made for known issues based upon the Directors interpretation of country-specific tax law and their assessment of the likely outcome.
CRITICAL JUDGEMENTS IN APPLYING ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY CONTINUED 3.4 TAXATION CONTINUED b Deferred tax The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in a number of the Groups businesses.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing differences might be recognised, then the value of deferred tax assets will need to be revised in a future period.
The Group also has losses and other timing differences for which no deferred tax assets have been recognised in these financial statements, relating either to loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of the timing difference is not probable or to where the timing difference is of such a nature that its value is dependent on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits.
If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, these losses and other timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of a reduced tax charge.
NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES The Company uses a number of non-Generally Accepted Accounting Practice non-GAAP financial measures in addition to those reported in accordance with IFRS.
The Directors believe that these non-GAAP measures, listed below, are important when assessing the underlying financial and operating performance of the Group and its divisions.
4.1 NET SALES VALUE Net sales value is calculated as revenue, excluding the amount included therein related to commodity metals.
4.2 RETURN ON SALES AND RETURN ON NET SALES VALUE Return on sales is calculated as trading profit divided by revenue.
Return on net sales value is calculated as trading profit divided by net sales value.
4.3 UNDERLYING REVENUE Underlying revenue is calculated as net sales value adjusted to exclude the effects of changes in exchange rates and business acquisitions, disposals and closures.
4.4 HEADLINE PROFIT BEFORE TAX Headline profit before tax is calculated as the net total of trading profit, plus the Groups share of post-tax profit of joint ventures and total net finance costs associated with ordinary activities.
4.5 HEADLINE EARNINGS PER SHARE Headline earnings per share is calculated as headline profit before tax and after income tax costs associated with ordinary activities and profit attributable to non-controlling interests, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
4.6 FREE CASH FLOW Free cash flow is defined as net cash flow from operating activities after net outlays for the purchase and sale of property, plant and equipment, dividends from joint ventures and dividends paid to non-controlling shareholders, but before additional funding contributions to Group pension plans.
4.7 AVERAGE WORKING CAPITAL TO SALES RATIO The average working capital to sales ratio is calculated as the percentage of average working capital balances to the annualised revenue for the year.
Average working capital comprising inventories, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables is calculated as the average of the six previous month-end balances, and annualised revenue is derived from the revenue for the previous six months.
4.8 EBITDA EBITDA is calculated as the total of trading profit before depreciation charges.
4.9 NET INTEREST Net interest is calculated as interest payable on borrowings less interest receivable, excluding any item therein considered by the Directors to be exceptional.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES CONTINUED 4.10 INTEREST COVER Interest cover is the ratio of EBITDA to net interest.
4.11 NET DEBT Net debt comprises the net total of current and non-current interest-bearing borrowings and cash and short-term deposits.
4.12 NET DEBT TO EBITDA Net debt to EBITDA is the ratio of net debt at the year-end to EBITDA for that year.
4.13 RETURN ON NET ASSETS Return on net assets RONA is calculated as trading profit plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by average net operating assets being the average over the previous 12 months of property, plant and equipment, trade working capital and other operating receivables and payables.
4.14 RETURN ON INVESTMENT Return on investment ROI is calculated as trading profit after tax plus share of post-tax profit of joint ventures, divided by invested capital being total equity plus net debt, net employee benefits liabilities and goodwill previously written off to, or amortised against, reserves.
SEGMENT INFORMATION The segment information contained in this note makes reference to several non-GAAP financial measures, definitions for which can be found in note 4.
5.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY a Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for goods supplied and services rendered to customers after deducting rebates, discounts and value-added taxes, and after eliminating sales within the Group.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when persuasive evidence exists, usually in the form of an executed sales agreement, that the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recovery of the consideration is probable, there is no continuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
A provision for anticipated returns is made based primarily on historical return rates.
Revenue from multi-year contractual arrangements, such as equipment installation contracts, is recognised as performance occurs.
Where a contractual arrangement consists of two or more separate elements that can be provided to customers either on a stand-alone basis or as an extra, such as the provision of supplementary materials with equipment, revenue is recognised for each element as if it were an individual contractual arrangement.
b Research and development costs Expenditure on research activities is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
All other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense in the year in which it is incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
5.2 BUSINESS SEGMENTS For reporting purposes, the Group is organised into three main business segments: Engineered Ceramics, Performance Materials and Precious Metals Processing and the senior executive management of each of these business segments reports to the Chief Executive of the Group.
It is the Cookson Board which makes the key operating decisions in respect of these segments.
The information used by the Cookson Board to review performance and determine resource allocation between the business segments is presented with the Groups activities segmented between the three business segments, Engineered Ceramics, Performance Materials and Precious Metals Processing.
Taking into account not only the basis on which the Groups activities are reported to the Cookson Board, but also the nature of the products and services of the product lines within each of these segments, the production processes involved in each and the nature of their end-markets, the Directors believe that these three business segments are the appropriate way to analyse the Groups results.
The principal activities of each of these segments are described in the Operating Review on pages 11 to 16.
Segment revenue represents revenue from external customers inter-segment revenue is not material and segment result is equivalent to trading profit excluding corporate costs directly related to managing the parent company, which are reported separately in the tables below.
Segment net operating assets exclude goodwill and other intangible assets, net debt, net employee benefits liabilities, net income tax liabilities and other net non-operating liabilities.
Segment result and segment net operating assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those items that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.

The remaining 7.5m comprised charges in relation to a number of small business closures in 2011 and trailing costs for some prior year closures.
The 0.6m loss in 2010 related to a number of small disposals from the Groups Engineered Ceramics and Performance Materials divisions.
A tax credit of 0.4m 2010: nil was associated with these losses.
FINANCE COSTS AND FINANCE INCOME 10.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges is included within interest payable on loans and overdrafts.
Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.
All other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.

The costs written off related to the old facility that had been due to expire in 2012.
The exceptional finance costs of 3.0m reported in 2010, resulted from the early repayment of certain committed bank facility borrowings, as a consequence of the issuance of $250m US Private Placement Loan Notes in December 2010.
The tax associated with these exceptional finance costs was nil 2010: nil.
INCOME TAX 11.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
Current and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that they relate to items charged or credited in other comprehensive income or directly to equity, in which case the associated tax is also dealt with in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from profit before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.

Tax charged in the Group statement of comprehensive income in the year amounted to 11.9m 2010: 0.7m, all of which related to net actuarial gains and losses on employee benefits plans.
The Group operates in a number of countries that have differing tax rates, laws and practices.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in the future.
Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2011, as effective tax relief may not be available for those losses or expenses.
Other significant factors affecting the tax charge are described in notes 3.4 and 11.1.

On the basis of approved business plans of these subsidiaries and in view of the significant improvement in market conditions in 2011, the Directors consider it probable that the tax loss carry-forwards and temporary differences can be offset against future taxable profits.
The total deferred tax asset not recognised as at 31 December 2011 was 483.7m 2010: 483.0m.
This consisted of: 41.9m 2010: 45.4m relating to capital losses that are available to offset future UK capital gains and may be carried forward without time limit: 230.9m 2010: 232.6m relating to operating losses: 92.3m 2010: 92.4m relating to unrelieved interest: 13.1m 2010: 13.1m relating to UK ACT tax credits, which may be carried forward indefinitely: and 105.5m 2010: 99.5m relating to other categories.
In accordance with the accounting policy in note 11.1, these items have not been recognised as deferred tax assets on the basis that their future economic benefit is not probable.
In total, there was an increase of 0.7m 2010: 7.4m in net unrecognised deferred tax assets during the year.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had total operating losses carried forward with a tax value of 236.0m 2010: 237.2m.
This total includes 103.0m 2010: 97.8m for losses which are available to offset future taxable US income, of which approximately 7.6m 2010: 7.6m will expire in 2020 and the remainder will expire between 2022 and 2031.
A further 101.5m 2010: 108.4m of losses are available to offset future UK taxable income and may be carried forward without time limit.
The remaining losses with a value of 31.5m 2010: 31.0m include 15.5m 2010: 15.9m which may be carried forward indefinitely and 11.8m 2010: 9.8m which will expire within the next five years if not used.
The balance of 4.2m 2010: 5.3m has a maximum life of between five and twenty years.
The amounts arise in a number of countries and are not individually significant, reflecting the spread of the Groups operations.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had unrelieved interest with a tax value of 92.3m 2010: 92.4m, which may be carried forward indefinitely, and US tax credits carried forward with a tax value of 10.2m 2010: 10.1m, comprising 2.8m 2010: 2.7m of research and experimentation credits, which expire between 2018 and 2031, and 7.4m 2010: 7.4m of foreign tax credits expiring between 2014 and 2018.
Due to changes in UK tax law enacted in 2009 exempting dividends received from UK tax, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and interests in joint ventures for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is nil 2010: nil.
From 1 April 2011, the UK corporation tax rate reduced from 28% to 26%.
A further UK corporation tax rate reduction to 25% was substantially enacted on 5 July 2011 and will have effect from 1 April 2012.
It is the UK Governments intention to enact legislation which will reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax to 23% by 2014, although this has not yet been substantively enacted under IFRS and UK GAAP.
Accordingly, the Groups closing UK deferred tax liability has been provided using a tax rate of 25%.
The impact of using this lower tax rate was to increase the exceptional tax credit relating to the amortisation of intangible assets from 5.0m to 7.2m.

Potential ordinary shares are only treated as dilutive when their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease earnings per share, or increase loss per share, from continuing operations.
In addition to the ordinary shares shown as being dilutive in the table above, the Company had 0.2m 2010: 0.5m of outstanding options and share awards in relation to its share-based payment plans that could dilute EPS in the future, but which are not included in the calculation of diluted and diluted headline EPS above because they were anti-dilutive in the years presented.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 16.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Freehold land is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Other items of property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Costs are capitalised only when it is probable that they will result in future economic benefits flowing to the Group and when they can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Group income statement in the period in which it is incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated as it has an infinite life.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment begins when the asset is available for use and is charged to the Group income statement on a straight-line basis so as to write off the cost less residual value of the asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Asset category Estimated useful life Freehold property between 10 and 50 years Leasehold property the term of the lease Plant and equipment motor vehicles between 1 and 5 years information technology equipment between 1 and 5 years other between 5 and 15 years The depreciation method used, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed and changed, if appropriate, at least at each financial year-end.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
As described in note 18.1, an assets carrying amount is immediately written down to its recoverable amount if its carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses arising on disposals are determined by comparing sales proceeds with carrying amount and are recognised in the Group income statement.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets comprise goodwill and other intangible assets that have been acquired through business combinations.
17.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY a Goodwill Goodwill arising in a business combination is initially recognised as an asset at cost, measured as the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount of any non-controlling interest acquired over the net of the acquisition-date fair value amounts of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost less accumulated impairment losses, with impairment testing carried out annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill has been allocated may be impaired.
On disposal of a business, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
b Other intangible assets Intangible assets other than goodwill are recognised on business combinations if they are separable, or if they arise from contractual or other legal rights, and their value can be measured reliably.
They are initially measured at cost, which is equal to the acquisition date fair value, and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortisation charges and accumulated impairment losses.
Other intangible assets are subject to impairment testing when there is an indication that an impairment loss may have been incurred and are amortised over their estimated useful lives.

For the purposes of impairment testing, the Directors consider that the Group has four CGUs: the Engineered Ceramics division, the Surface Chemistries and Joining Technologies product lines of the Performance Materials division and the Precious Metals Processing division.
These CGUs represent the lowest level within the Group at which goodwill is monitored.
The goodwill attributable to the Precious Metals Processing division CGU has been fully impaired and consequently the amount recognised in the Group balance sheet is nil 2010: nil.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CONTINUED 17.4 ANALYSIS OF OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets arose in 2008 on the acquisition of Foseco plc and are being amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
The assets acquired and their remaining useful lives are shown below.

IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 18.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY At each balance sheet date, the Directors review the carrying value of the Groups tangible and other intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent, if any, of the impairment loss.
Where it is not feasible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Directors estimate the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit CGU to which the asset belongs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to each of the Groups CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination and the Directors carry out annual impairment testing of the carrying value of its CGUs, to assess the need for any impairment of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets associated with these CGUs.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the higher of i its fair value less costs to sell and ii its value in use.
If the recoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of that CGU, the resulting impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
An impairment loss recognised in a prior year for an asset other than goodwill may be reversed where there has been a change in the estimates used to measure the assets recoverable amount since the impairment loss was recognised.
The value in use calculations of the Groups CGUs are based on detailed business plans covering a three year period from the balance sheet date, higher level assumptions covering a further two year period and perpetuity calculations beyond this five year projection period.
The cash flows in the calculations are discounted to their current value using pre-tax discount rates.
18.2 KEY ASSUMPTIONS The key assumptions used in determining value in use are return on sales, return on net sales value, growth rates and discount rates.
Return on sales and return on net sales value assumptions are based on historical financial information, adjusted to factor in the anticipated impact of restructuring and rationalisation plans already announced at the balance sheet date.
Growth rates are determined with reference to: current market conditions: external forecasts and historical trends for the Groups key endmarkets of steel production, foundry castings and electronics: and expected growth in output within the industries in which each major Group business unit operates.
A perpetuity growth rate of 2.5% 2010: 3% has been applied based on the long-term growth rates experienced in the Groups end-markets and external forecasts.
The Groups projections are based on historical trends and external forecasts.
Discount rates are calculated for each CGU, reflecting market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to each CGU.
The pretax discount rate used for the Engineered Ceramics CGU was 14.9% 2010: 14.5%, for the Surface Chemistries CGU 15.0% 2010: 14.1% and for the Joining Technologies CGU 13.8% 2010: 12.5%.
18.3 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT In assessing goodwill for potential impairment as at 31 December 2011, the Directors made use of detailed calculations of the recoverable amount of the Groups CGUs as at 31 December 2011.
Those calculations resulted in recoverable amounts significantly higher than the carrying values of each of the Groups CGUs and consequently no impairment charges were recognised.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 19.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, less impairment losses.
19.2 ANALYSIS OF TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 2011 2010 Gross Impairment Net Gross Impairment Net m m m m m m Trade receivables current 325.4 3.2 322.2 346.4 3.5 342.9 1 to 30 days past due 68.4 0.9 67.5 63.7 0.9 62.8 31 to 60 days past due 22.5 1.0 21.5 21.7 0.6 21.1 61 to 90 days past due 11.6 0.6 11.0 9.2 1.0 8.2 over 90 days past due 44.3 22.0 22.3 38.5 25.3 13.2 Trade receivables 472.2 27.7 444.5 479.5 31.3 448.2 Other receivables 40.8 38.8 Prepayments and accrued income 44.7 35.9 Total trade and other receivables 530.0 522.9 All of the Groups operating companies have policies and procedures in place to assess the creditworthiness of the customers with whom they do business.
Where objective evidence exists that a trade receivable balance may be impaired, provision is made for the difference between its carrying amount and the present value of the estimated cash that will be recovered.
Evidence of impairment may include such factors as the customer being in breach of contract, or entering bankruptcy or financial reorganisation proceedings.
Impairment provisions are assessed on an individual customer basis for all significant outstanding balances and collectively for all remaining balances, based upon historical loss experience.
Historical experience has shown that the Groups trade receivable provisions are maintained at levels that are sufficient to absorb actual bad debt write-offs, without being excessive.

Cost comprises expenditure incurred in purchasing or manufacturing inventories together with all other costs directly incurred in bringing the inventory to its present location and condition and, where appropriate, attributable production overheads based on normal activity levels.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
The amount of any write-down of inventories to net realisable value is recognised as an expense in the year in which the write-down occurs.
20.2 ANALYSIS OF INVENTORIES 2011 2010 m m Raw materials 110.4 104.7 Work-in-progress 33.4 32.7 Finished goods 156.4 150.1 Total inventories 300.2 287.5 The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales in the income statement during the year was 1,459.2m 2010: 1,263.7m.
As at 31 December 2011, in addition to the inventory recorded in the balance sheet, the Group held 362.8m 2010: 354.8m of precious metals on consignment terms and 271.4m 2010: 168.6m of precious metals on behalf of customers for processing.
Cookson has entered into various precious metal consignment arrangements with precious metals consigning entities the Consignors.
The metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from a Consignor and sold concurrently to the customer, or may be consigned and sold directly from a Consignor to the Groups customers, with the Group charging customers only for the fabrication process.
As the Consignors retain title and associated risks and rewards of ownership under these arrangements, the value of the physical metal so held is not recognised in the Group balance sheet.
Consequently, the obligations in respect of the consigned metal are not recognised as a liability in the Group balance sheet.
The utilisation of consigned precious metals is established practice in the precious metals industry.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 21.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The Group uses derivative financial instruments derivatives in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, forward commodity contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to foreign exchange risk, commodity price risk and interest rate risk.
The way in which derivatives are used to manage the Groups financial risk is detailed in note 27.
Derivatives are measured at fair value.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts and forward commodity contracts is calculated using market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of an interest rate swap is the estimated amount that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparty.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Strict conditions have to be satisfied in order to qualify for hedge accounting, including a determination both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis that the hedge is expected to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk.
The change in fair value of a derivative that is not designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Wherever possible, the Group avoids the administrative burden of hedge accounting, and does not designate a derivative as a hedge when, in the absence of hedge accounting, the change in fair value of the hedged item is itself recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement in the same period as the change in fair value of the derivative.
No derivatives are held for speculative purposes.
Cash flow hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a cash flow hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the hedging reserve in equity.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit, or within finance costs in the case of interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges.
When the transaction that was being hedged is realised and affects profit or loss, the cumulative gain or loss on the derivative is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the same period.
Fair value hedges The change in fair value of a derivative that is designated as a fair value hedge is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in its fair value that is attributable to the hedged risk and this adjustment is recognised within trading profit in the Group income statement.
Net investment hedges The effective part of any gain or loss on a derivative that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and is subsequently recognised in the Group income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
The ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognised immediately within trading profit in the Group income statement.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT 27.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY a Non-derivative financial instruments Loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
b Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each Group entity are prepared in their functional currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which that entity operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each entity are translated into pounds sterling, which is the presentational currency of the Group.
Reporting foreign currency transactions in functional currency Transactions in currencies other than the entitys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date: i Foreign currency monetary items are retranslated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement or retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the Group income statement: and ii Non-monetary items measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Translation from functional currency to presentational currency When the functional currency of a Group entity is different from the Groups presentational currency pounds sterling, its results and financial position are translated into the presentational currency as follows: i Assets and liabilities are translated using exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date: ii Income and expense items are translated at average exchange rates for the year, except where the use of such average rates does not approximate the exchange rate at the date of a specific transaction, in which case the transaction rate is used: and iii All resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and are reclassified to profit or loss in the period in which the foreign operation is disposed.
Net investment in foreign operations Exchange differences arising on a monetary item that forms part of a reporting entitys net investment in a foreign operation are initially recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the translation reserve in equity and reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the net investment.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 27.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS The Groups treasury department, acting in accordance with policies approved by the Board, is principally responsible for managing the financial risks faced by the Group.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks, the most significant of which are market risk and liquidity risk.
a Market risk Market risk is the risk that either the fair values or the cash flows of the Groups financial instruments may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
The Group is principally exposed to market risk through fluctuations in exchange rates currency risk and interest rates interest rate risk.
Currency risk The Group is exposed to currency risk on its borrowings and financial assets being cash and short-term deposits that are denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The Groups general policy is proportionally to match the currency profile of its core borrowings with the currency profile of its earnings and net assets achieved, where necessary, by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts FX swaps.
The currency profile of the Groups borrowings and financial assets, reflecting the effect of the FX swaps, is shown in the table below.
The tables below show the net unhedged monetary assets and liabilities of Group companies that are not denominated in their functional currency and which could give rise to exchange gains and losses in the Group income statement.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 27.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED Net unhedged monetary assets liabilities Sterling US dollar Euro Renminbi Other Total m m m m m m Functional currency Sterling 0.3 2.1 7.2 0.3 9.9 United States dollar 0.7 1.8 1.7 4.2 Euro 1.7 2.6 0.3 1.2 Chinese renminbi 0.1 4.1 5.1 4.4 5.5 Other 0.9 1.2 6.7 11.0 0.9 17.1 As at 31 December 2010 2.0 8.2 5.5 18.2 3.0 26.9 Interest rate risk The Groups interest rate risk principally arises in relation to its borrowings.
Where borrowings are held at floating rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to variability in the cash flows associated with its interest payments and where borrowings are held at fixed rates of interest, fluctuations in interest rates expose the Group to changes in the fair value of its borrowings.
The Groups policy is to maintain a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings, within certain parameters agreed from time to time by the Board, in order to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had $440m 283.7m of US Private Placement Loan Notes outstanding, which carry a fixed rate of interest, representing just over half of the Groups total borrowings outstanding at that date.
The Group had also entered into floating to fixed interest rate swaps in order to increase the level of fixed rate borrowings to around two-thirds.
The interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings and net debt, reflecting the effect of these interest rate swaps, is detailed in the tables below.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 27.2 FINANCIAL RISK FACTORS CONTINUED The floating rate financial liabilities shown in the tables above bear interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, plus a margin.
The fixed rate financial liabilities of 357.0m 2010: 380.3m have a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% 2010: 5.1% and a weighted average period for which the rate is fixed of 3.7 years 2010: 4.5 years.
The financial assets attract floating rate interest at the inter-bank offered rate of the appropriate currency, less a margin.
Based upon the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities shown in the tables above, a 1% increase in market interest rates would increase both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.1m 2010: 0.5m decrease and a 1% reduction in market interest rates would decrease both the net finance costs charged in the Group income statement and the net interest paid in the Group statement of cash flows by 0.1m 2010: 0.5m increase.
Similarly, a 1% increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease of 10.9m 2010: 11.5m in the fair value of the Groups net debt and a 1% decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase of 11.7m 2010: 12.3m in the fair value of the Groups net debt.
b Liquidity risk Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group might have difficulties in meeting its financial obligations.
The Group manages this risk by ensuring that it maintains sufficient levels of committed borrowing facilities and cash and cash equivalents to ensure that it can meet its operational cash flow requirements and any maturing financial liabilities, while at all times operating within its financial covenants.
The level of operational headroom provided by the Groups committed borrowing facilities is reviewed at least annually as part of the Groups three year planning process.
Where this process indicates a need for additional finance, this is normally addressed 12 to 18 months in advance by means of either additional committed bank facilities or raising finance in the capital markets.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group had committed borrowing facilities of 883.7m 2010: 855.4m, of which 339.5m 2010: 350.0m were undrawn.
These undrawn facilities are due to expire in April 2016.
The Groups borrowing requirements are met by US Private Placement Loan Notes USPP and a multi-currency committed syndicated bank facility of 600.0m 2010: 573.2m.
The USPP facility was fully drawn as at 31 December 2011 and amounted to 283.7m $440.0m, of which $190.0m is repayable in May 2012, $110.0m in 2017, and $140.0m in 2020.
The syndicated bank facility comprises a 600.0m revolving credit facility.
The facility is repayable in April 2016.
The maturity analysis of the Groups gross borrowings is shown in the tables below.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED 27.3 CAPITAL MANAGEMENT The Group considers its capital to be equal to the sum of its total equity and net debt.
It monitors its capital using a number of key performance indicators, including free cash flow, average working capital to sales ratios, net debt to EBITDA ratios, RONA and ROI note 4.
The Groups objectives when managing its capital are: `` to ensure that the Group and all of its businesses are able to operate as going concerns and ensure that the Group operates within the financial covenants contained within its debt facilities: `` to maximise shareholder value through maintaining an appropriate balance between the Groups equity and net debt: `` to have available the necessary financial resources to allow the Group to invest in areas that may deliver acceptable future returns to investors: and `` to maintain sufficient financial resources to mitigate against risks and unforeseen events.
The Group operated comfortably within the requirements of its debt covenants throughout the year and has substantial liquidity headroom within its committed debt facilities.
Details of the Groups covenant compliance and committed debt facilities can be found in the Financial Review on page 19.
The Group has performance targets page 2 that include maintaining a strong financial position with a year-end net debt to EBITDA ratio of not more than 1.5 times and dividend growth at least in line with earnings growth.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 28.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The net surplus or net liability recognised in the Group balance sheet for the Groups defined benefits plans is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date as adjusted for unrecognised past service costs, less the fair value of the plan assets.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method and by discounting the estimated future cash flows using interest rates on high quality corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension liability.
Any asset recognised in respect of a surplus arising from this calculation is limited to the sum of unrecognised past service costs plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in future contributions to the plan.
The expense for the Groups defined benefits plans is recognised in the Group income statement as shown in note 28.7.
Actuarial gains and losses arising on the assets and liabilities of the plans are reported within the Group statement of comprehensive income: and gains and losses arising on settlements and curtailments are recognised in the Group income statement in the same line as the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment or, if material, separately reported as a component of profit from operations.
28.2 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS The Group operates a number of pension plans around the world, both of the defined benefits and defined contribution type, and accounts for them in accordance with IAS 19. a Defined benefits pension plans The Groups principal defined benefits pension plans are in the UK and the US.
The assets of these plans are held separately from the Group in trustee-administered funds.
The trustees are required to act in the best interests of the plans beneficiaries.
The Group also has defined benefits pension plans in other territories but, with the exception of those in Germany, these are not individually material in relation to the Group as a whole.
The Groups main defined benefits pension plan in the UK the UK Plan is closed to new members and to future benefit accrual.
A full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is carried out every three years by an independent actuary for the UK Plan Trustee and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2009.
At that date, the market value of plan assets was 401.9m and this represented a funding level of 88% of the accrued plan benefits at the time of 456.4m.
Calculated on a buy-out basis using an estimation of the cost of buying out the UK Plan benefits with an insurance company, the liabilities at that date were 589.0m, representing a funding level of 68%.
The Company and Trustee have agreed a schedule of contributions under which the Company is making top-up payments of 7.0m per annum until February 2016, targeted at eliminating the 2009 full actuarial valuation deficit in the UK Plan by that date.
The level of top-up payments will be reviewed based on the UK Plans next triennial valuation as at 31 December 2012, which should be available in mid-2013.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED 28.2 GROUP POST-RETIREMENT PLANS CONTINUED In July 2010 the UK Government announced that with effect from 1 January 2011 it would be changing the statutory index used for revaluing future pension benefits from the Retail Price Index RPI to the Consumer Price Index CPI.
This change impacted the revaluation of benefits under the UK Plan.
The 2,900 deferred members of the UK Plan were therefore notified during the year that, from 1 January 2011, future increases in their accrued benefits would be calculated with reference to changes in CPI rather than RPI, as was previously the case.
Increases in pensions in payment remain linked to changes in RPI, as specified by the Trust Deed of the UK Plan.
In addition to notifying the deferred members of this change to the valuation of their accrued benefits, the Company offered those members the opportunity to transfer their benefits from the UK Plan at a valuation enhanced above that normally available, including the retention of RPI as a basis for the valuation of the members transfer values.
As at 31 December 2011, this enhanced transfer value offer was still open, with a total of 276 members having so far accepted the offer, representing the removal of 37.3m of pension liabilities and 43.2m of pension assets from the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2011.
The revaluation of the liabilities representing deferred member benefits, using growth assumptions based on CPI rather than RPI, resulted in a reduction in the Groups pension liabilities of 21.5m, such amount being recognised in the Group income statement as an exceptional credit, net of the cost of enhancing the transfer payments made to members who, by 31 December 2011, had transferred.
When the Companys enhanced transfer value offer closes in 2012, a further adjustment will be made to the Groups balance sheet liabilities and an exceptional charge reported to recognise the cost of the enhancement relating to those deferred members who transfer their accrued benefits after 31 December 2011 under the Groups offer.
The UK Plan operates a hedging strategy, using a combination of swaps and bonds, to mitigate the impact of interest rate and inflation rate movements on the value of its projected liabilities for meeting future pension payments the UK Plans economic liabilities, the value of which is related more to interest rate and inflation rate swap yields than to corporate bond yields, upon which the discount rate used for IAS 19 valuation purposes is based.
When the relationship between the relevant swap yields and corporate bond yields is stable, the UK Plans hedging strategy should deliver a broadly stable funding ratio the ratio of plan assets to plan liabilities not just in relation to the UK Plans economic liabilities, but also under an IAS 19 basis of valuation.
As at 31 December 2011, the estimated funding position incorporating the UK Plans economic liabilities showed a funding ratio of 97%, with the IAS 19 valuation reflecting a funding ratio of 116%.
This represents a valuation difference of 80m, reflecting the use of more prudent valuation assumptions for funding purposes.
The Group continues to fund the UK Plan with reference to its economic funding position.
The Group has a number of defined benefits plans in the US, providing retirement benefits based on final salary or a fixed benefit.
In addition, the Groups US Retirement Security Plan has characteristics similar to defined contribution plans but with a minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members accounts.
The cash balance rate assumption in the table in note 28.3 b refers to the assumed minimum guaranteed return on members accounts.
The Retirement Security Plan and the Groups other principal US defined benefits plans are closed to new members and also to future benefit accrual for existing members.
Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefits pension plans are carried out every year and the last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2010.
At that date the market value of the plan assets was 109.4m, representing a funding level of 65% of accrued plan benefits at that date using the projected unit method of valuation of 167.3m.
Funding levels for the Groups US defined benefits pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
The Group has a number of defined benefits pension arrangements in Germany which are unfunded, as is common practice in that country.
b Defined contribution pension plans The total expense for the Groups defined contribution plans in the Group income statement amounted to 17.7m 2010: 15.7m and represents the contributions payable for the year by the Group to the plans.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED 28.3 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION AND RISK MITIGATION The assumptions used in calculating the costs and obligations of the Groups defined benefits pension plans, as detailed below, are set by the Directors after consultation with independent professionally qualified actuaries.
a Mortality assumptions The mortality assumptions used in the actuarial valuations of the Groups UK, US and German defined benefits pension liabilities are summarised in the table below and have been selected to reflect the characteristics and experience of the membership of those plans.
For the UK Plan, the assumptions used have been derived from the Self-Administered Pension Schemes SAPS All table, with future longevity improvements in line with the core mortality improvement tables published in 2011 by the Continuous Mortality Investigation CMI, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.
The latter CMI tables are expected to replace the use of the Cohort improvement factors widely used since 2002.
For the Groups US plans, the assumptions used have been based on the standard RP2000CH mortality tables, projected 64 years for non-pensioners and 33 years for pensioners using projection scale AA.
The Groups major plans in Germany have been valued using the Heubeck-Richttafeln 2005G mortality tables.

The UK discount rate in the above table is based on the annualised yield on the iBoxx over 15 year AA-rated sterling corporate bond index: the US discount rate is based on the equivalent iBoxx index for US domestic corporations: and the German discount rate is based on the yield on the iBoxx over 10 year euro corporates AA index.
The assumptions for price inflation are set by reference to the difference between yields on longer-term conventional government bonds and index-linked bonds, except for CPI, for which no appropriate bonds exist, which is assumed to be 0.9pts lower than RPI-based inflation.
The expected asset return is the Companys expectation at the valuation date of long-term asset returns: based on the risk-free yield available by following a buy and hold investment strategy in government bonds: with returns for other bonds and equities estimated based on observed historic long-term strategic risk premia.
These assumptions do not take account of the relative valuation of markets or of market momentum.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS CONTINUED 28.3 POST-RETIREMENT LIABILITY VALUATION AND RISK MITIGATION CONTINUED c UK Plan risk mitigation strategy The Company and the UK Plan Trustee have identified the major risks which could affect the value of the UK Plans economic liabilities compared to the value of its assets and the Trustee has taken action, as summarised below, to reduce the risk that the UK Plans economic liabilities would increase materially relative to the value of its assets: RISK AND IMPACT MITIGATION Interest rate risk The risk of government bond An interest rate swap overlay is in place designed, together with the bond portfolio, to mitigate approximately 75% interest rates falling, leading of the interest rate risk of the UK Plan liabilities as measured on an ongoing basis.
Under these contracts the UK Plan to an increase in the value of receives a fixed rate of interest and pays out a variable rate of interest, based on the London Inter Bank Offered Rate.
This is beneficial when long-term interest rates fall, significantly offsetting the corresponding increase in the value of the UK Plans economic liabilities.
In December 2010 an interest rate swaption collar was transacted, designed to mitigate the remaining 25% of interest rate risk in the case of extreme market movements during the following three years.
Inflation risk The risk of inflation rising Inflation swaps are in place designed, together with the bond portfolio, to mitigate approximately 70% of the faster than expected, leading effective inflation risk of the UK Plan liabilities as measured on an ongoing basis.
The UK Plan pays out a fixed rate to an increase in the value of of interest and receives payments indexed with actual inflation.

Investment risk The risk of significant The UK Plan Trustee has migrated the UK Plans asset portfolio to its current allocation, excluding risk-mitigation financial market falls, leading derivatives, of 58% bonds and 21% in equities.
This structure, together with its liability driven investment to a fall in the value of plan portfolio of financial derivative contracts, significantly reduces the risk that the UK Plans assets would fall assets.

d Sensitivity analysis of the impact of changes in key IAS 19 actuarial assumptions The following table analyses, for the Groups main UK, US and German pension plans, the theoretical estimated impact on plan liabilities resulting from changes to key actuarial assumptions used for IAS 19 valuation purposes, whilst holding all other assumptions constant.
It should be noted that the investment strategy adopted by the UK Plan, details of which are given above, was designed to mitigate a significant majority of the interest rate and inflation risk related to the UK Plans economic liabilities.
The stabilising impact of this strategy is not reflected in the following table.

In addition to the assets reported above, 4.1m 2010: 3.9m of assets were held as at 31 December 2011 to fund certain non-qualified US pension plan obligations.
These assets are not included within pension plan assets as they are available to satisfy creditors in the event of the winding-up of the Group company in which they are held and are reported as investments in the Group balance sheet.
The actual return on all Group pension plan assets was 110.1m 2010: 63.5m.

TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 30.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
2 ANALYSIS OF TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 2011 2010 m m Non-current Accruals and other payables 18.7 22.0 Deferred purchase consideration 0.5 1.1 Total non-current other payables 19.2 23.1 Current Trade payables 225.2 232.2 Other taxes and social security 45.3 46.3 Accruals and other payables 138.0 146.4 Deferred purchase consideration 0.9 0.8 Total current trade and other payables 409.4 425.7 There is no significant difference between the fair value of the Groups trade and other payables balances and the amount at which they are reported in the Group balance sheet.
LEASES 31.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
31.2 OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS 2011 2010 m m The future aggregate minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases are payable as follows: Not later than one year 17.1 17.3 Later than one year and not later than five years 41.4 41.7 Later than five years 44.7 49.2 Total operating lease commitments 103.2 108.2 The Groups property, plant and equipment assets are either purchased outright or held under lease contracts.
Where the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to the Group, the asset is capitalised in the Group balance sheet and the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised as a finance lease obligation.
Where all the risks and rewards of ownership are not transferred to the Group, the lease is classified as an operating lease and neither the asset nor the corresponding liability to the lessor is recognised in the Group balance sheet.
The net book value of the Groups property, plant and equipment assets held under finance lease contracts at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 was not material.
The cost incurred by the Group in the year in respect of assets held under operating leases, all of which was charged within trading profit, amounted to 25.6m 2010: 25.6m.
PROVISIONS 32.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle that obligation.
Provisions are measured at the Directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects both the current market assessment of the time value of money and the specific risks associated with the obligation.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
32.2 ANALYSIS OF PROVISIONS Disposal and Restructuring closure costs charges Other Total m m m m As at 1 January 2011 34.3 38.4 13.1 85.8 Exchange adjustments 0.2 0.2 Charge credit to Group income statement 13.8 9.8 0.5 23.1 Unwind of discount 1.1 1.3 2.4 Cash spend 8.2 17.8 1.6 27.6 Transferred to liabilities classified as held for sale note 22 3.1 3.1 As at 31 December 2011 38.1 31.5 11.0 80.6 Of the total provision balance as at 31 December 2011 of 80.6m 2010: 85.8m, 55.7m 2010: 53.2m is recognised in the Group balance sheet within non-current liabilities and 24.9m 2010: 32.6m within current liabilities.
The provision for disposal and closure costs includes the Directors current best estimate of the costs to be incurred both in the fulfilment of obligations incurred in connection with former Group businesses, resulting from either disposal or closure, together with those related to the demolition and clean-up of closed sites.
The provision comprises amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims, including claims relating to product liability.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated cash outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
The provision for restructuring charges includes the costs of all of the Groups initiatives to rationalise its operating activities.
The balance of 31.5m as at 31 December 2011 comprises 24.4m in relation to onerous lease provisions in respect of leases terminating between two and seventeen years, and 7.1m in relation to future expenditure on restructuring initiatives which is expected to be paid out over the next two years.
Other provisions comprise amounts payable in respect of known or probable costs resulting both from legal or other regulatory requirements, or from third-party claims.
As the settlement of many of the obligations for which provision is made is subject to legal or other regulatory process, the timing of the associated outflows is subject to some uncertainty, but the majority of the amounts provided are expected to be utilised over the next five years and the underlying estimates of costs are regularly updated to reflect changed circumstances with regard to individual matters.
Where insurance cover exists for any of these known or probable costs, a related asset is recognised in the Group balance sheet only when its realisation is virtually certain.
As at 31 December 2011, 8.3m 2010: 10.1m was recorded in receivables in respect of associated insurance reimbursements, of which 6.3m 2010: 7.5m is non-current.
The amounts reported in the table above as charged to the Group income statement represent only that part of the total income statement charge reported as a movement on provisions.
Other components of the charge, such as asset write-offs, are reported as a reduction in the carrying value of the relevant balance sheet item.

ACQUISITION OF SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED During the year, the Group acquired interests in subsidiaries and joint ventures for a total consideration of 13.2m, of which 12.8m was paid in cash and 0.4m is contingent upon future performance.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 3.0m of which 2.3m was cash.
Goodwill arising on these acquisitions amounted to 8.3m note 17.
The 11.3m disclosed in the Group statement of cash flows in respect of the acquisition of subsidiaries and joint ventures, net of cash acquired, comprised: 10.9m paid for current year acquisitions: 1.9m invested in joint ventures: 0.8m of deferred consideration paid in respect of prior year acquisitions: less 2.3m of cash acquired with current year acquisitions.
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In compliance with current reporting requirements, certain arrangements entered into by the Group in its normal course of business are not reported in the Group balance sheet.
Of such arrangements, those considered material by the Directors include: inventory held either under precious metal consignment arrangements or on behalf of customers for processing note 20 : future lease payments in relation to assets used by the Group under non-cancellable operating leases note 31 : and trade receivable balances that have been subject to non-recourse factoring arrangements.
Under its non-recourse factoring arrangements, the Group sells trade receivables balances to a third-party factoring company in exchange for a cash payment from the factoring company, net of fees.
All the risks and rewards of the trade receivables subject to these arrangements are transferred to the factoring company and, accordingly, the trade receivables are derecognised in the Group balance sheet.
Such arrangements are used from time to time by the Group to manage the recovery of cash from its trade receivables.
As at 31 December 2011, the Group balance sheet included 41.7m 2010: 39.4m of cash that would otherwise have been reported as trade receivables if these arrangements were not in place.
Factoring fees incurred during the year ended 31 December 2011, which are written off to the Group income statement within ordinary finance costs, amounted to 1.8m 2010: 1.5m.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Guarantees given by the Group under property leases of operations disposed of amounted to 4.1m 2010: 4.1m.
Details of guarantees given by the Company, on behalf of the Group, are given in note 14 to the Company financial statements.
The Group has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Legal claims have been brought against certain Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials used by those companies in the manufacture of industrial and consumer products, and further claims may be brought in the future.
Certain of the Groups subsidiaries are subject to lawsuits, predominantly in the US, relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group.
These suits usually also name many other product manufacturers.
To date, the Group is not aware of there being any liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
A number of lawsuits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not had a material adverse effect on the Groups financial position or results of operations.
PRINCIPAL SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURES Details of the principal subsidiaries and joint ventures of Cookson Group plc and the countries in which they are incorporated are given in note 5 to the Company financial statements.
RELATED PARTIES All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arms length basis and in accordance with normal business terms.
Transactions between related parties that are Group subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
EVENTS AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE On 22 February 2012, the Group entered into an agreement to sell its US Precious Metals business, a part of its Precious Metals Processing division, to Richline Group, Inc. a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.
Completion of the transaction is expected in the second quarter of 2012.
As at 31 December 2011, the net assets of the US Precious Metals business were classified as held for sale in the Group balance sheet note 22 and a loss on disposal of operations of 29.0m was reported in the Group income statement note 9.
