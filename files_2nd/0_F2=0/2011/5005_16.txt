The first reduction from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted by 30 April 2010 and is effective from 1 April 2011.
Accordingly the rate applying to UK assets and liabilities has also been reduced from 28% to 26%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the consolidated income statement, and partly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or equity.
The reduction in rate from 26% to 24% has not yet been substantively enacted: had it been, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax liability by 0.2m, of which it is estimated that 4.6m would have been credited to the consolidated income statement and 4.4m would have been charged to the statement of comprehensive income.
