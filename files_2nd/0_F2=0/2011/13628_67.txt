c Long Term Incentive Plan The Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP is a performance share or cash unit plan under which shares or cash units are conditionally allocated to selected members of senior management at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee on an annual basis.
Following shareholder approval of the LTIP at the Companys AGM on 18 May 2000, awards over shares were made to executive directors and senior managers in each year from 2000 to 2009.
In 2009, 2010 and 2011 awards were only made under the share-based scheme.
LTIP - 2008 and 2009 awards No shares or cash units will normally be released to participants unless they are still in the Groups service following completion of three year performance periods and the Companys relative total shareholder return TSR against a comparator group of companies places it in at least the 50th percentile position in the comparator group at the end of the relevant performance period.
TSR measures the change in value of a share and reinvested dividends over the period of measurement.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be determined by the number of shares or cash units initially allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares or cash units transferred will be 30% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile with each percentile position above the 50th adding 2.8% to the vesting percentage.
The Companys earnings per share EPS is also monitored during the relevant performance period to ensure it meets a minimum average annual growth equal to the rise in the Retail Price Index RPI plus 2% per annum.
Failure to meet the RPI requirement will result in nil vesting.
The performance period for the 2008 awards ended on 31 December 2010.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 94.4% vesting of this award as the Company was in the 73rd percentile relative to the comparator group and the Groups EPS growth has exceeded the minimum average annual growth in the RPI plus 2% per annum.
The performance period for the 2009 awards ended on 31 December 2011.
Messrs.  LLP as independent actuaries certified to the Remuneration Committee that there was a 30.0% vesting of these awards based on the performance criteria of the scheme.
The awards will vest during 2012.

The actual number of shares transferred will be determined by the number of shares allocated multiplied by a vesting percentage.
The actual number of shares transferred will be 25% at the 50th percentile rising to 100% at the 75th percentile.
The EPS performance condition is satisfied with 15% of the awards vesting if the EPS growth is RPI 10% over the vesting period up to a maximum of 100% vesting if EPS growth exceeds RPI 25%.
