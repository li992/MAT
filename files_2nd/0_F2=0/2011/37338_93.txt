Financial risk management Introduction A review of the Groups objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Financial review p3437 and Our risks and how we manage them p4143.
This note provides further detail on financial risk management and includes quantitative information on specic financial risks.
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks: market risks principally interest-rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Groups overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise the potential adverse effects on the Groups financial performance and includes the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Financial risk management is carried out by Group Treasury under policies approved by the Board of Directors.
Capital structure The capital structure of the Group consists of shareholders equity and net borrowings, including cash held on deposit.
The type and maturity of the Groups borrowings are analysed further in note 27 and the Groups equity is analysed into its various components in the Statement of changes in equity.
Capital is managed so as to promote the long-term success of the business and to maintain sustainable returns for shareholders.
Whilst the Group is maintaining a strong focus on the business actions which are within its inuence, a number of factors affecting the market in which the Group operates are beyond the Groups control.
After a period of rapid valuation decline, values began to stabilise in mid-2009, and have since experienced a strong rebound.
As a result of this and other actions taken, the Board believes the Group now has an appropriate gearing level for this phase of the property cycle.
The Groups strategy is to maintain an appropriate net debt to total equity ratio gearing and loan-to-value ratio LTV to ensure that asset level performance is translated into enhanced returns for shareholders whilst maintaining an appropriate risk reward balance to accommodate changing financial and operating market cycles.
The following table details a number of the Groups key metrics in relation to managing its capital structure.

Financial risk management continued Financial risk factors i Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, finance lease receivables, amounts due from joint ventures, loans to third parties and commercial property backed loan notes.
Further details concerning the credit risk of counterparties is provided in the note that specically relates to each type of asset.
Bank and financial institutions One of the principal credit risks of the Group arises from financial derivative instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions.
In line with the policy approved by the Board of Directors, only independently-rated banks and financial institutions with a minimum rating of A are accepted.
Group Treasury currently performs a weekly review of the credit ratings of all its financial institution counterparties.
Furthermore, Group Treasury ensures that funds deposited with a single financial institution remain within the Groups policy limits.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
Impairment is made where there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables concerned.
The balance is low relative to the scale of the balance sheet and, owing to the long-term nature and diversity of its tenancy arrangements, the credit risk of trade receivables is considered to be low.
Furthermore, a credit report is obtained from an independent rating agency prior to the inception of a lease with a new counterparty.
This report is used to determine the size of the deposit that is required from the tenant at inception.
In general these deposits represent between three and six months rent.
Property sales Property sales receivables primarily relate to the sale of one property, for which all payments to date have been received when due.
The credit risk on outstanding amounts is considered low.
Finance lease receivables This balance relates to amounts receivable from tenants in respect of tenant finance leases.
This is not considered a significant credit risk as the tenants are generally of good financial standing.
Loans to third parties A loan maturing in 2035 was made to Semperian PPP formerly Trillium Investment Partners LP as part of the disposal of the Trillium business.
This loan is not considered a significant credit risk as it is repayable from dividends from investments in Government infrastructure projects.
Commercial property backed loan notes The Group has acquired investments in commercial property backed loan notes which have been independently rated with a rating of AAA.
ii Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of Notes with final maturities between 2013 and 2036, and medium-term committed bank facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for its operations and its committed capital expenditure programme.
Undrawn committed credit lines represent total undrawn committed facilities adjusted for amounts that would be restricted as a result of LTV covenants.
The Groups core nancing structure is in the Security Group, although the remaining Non-Restricted Group may also secure independent funding.
Security Group The Groups principal nancing arrangements utilise the credit support of a ring-fenced group of assets the Security Group that comprises the majority of the Groups investment property portfolio.
These arrangements operate in tiers determined by LTV and interest cover ratio ICR.
This structure is most exible at lower tiers with a lower LTV and a higher ICR and allows property acquisitions, disposals and developments to occur with relative freedom.
In higher tiers, the requirements become more prescriptive.
No financial covenant default is triggered until the applicable LTV exceeds 100% or the ICR is less than 1.0 x.
As at 31 March 2011, the reported LTV for the Security Group was 40.1% 2010: 45.5%, meaning that the Group was operating in Tier 1 and benefited from maximum operational exibility.
Management monitors the key covenants attached to the Security Group on a monthly basis, including LTV, ICR, sector and regional concentration and disposals.

Financial risk management continued Non-Restricted Group The Non-Restricted Group obtains funding when required from a combination of inter-company loans from the Security Group, equity and external bank debt.
Bespoke credit facilities are established with banks when required for the Non-Restricted Group projects and joint ventures, usually on a limited-recourse basis.
The table below analyses the Groups financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the expected maturity date.
The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted cash ows.
Contractual cash ows include the payment of future finance charges arising on liabilities in existence at the balance sheet date.
2011 and 2010 are presented on a consistent basis.
iii Market risk The Group is exposed to market risk through interest rates, currency uctuations and availability of credit.
Interest rates The Group uses interest-rate swaps and similar instruments to manage its interest-rate exposure.
With property and interest-rate cycles typically of four to seven years duration, the Groups target is to have a minimum of 80% of anticipated debt at xed rates of interest over this time frame.
Due to a combination of factors, principally the high level of certainty required under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, hedging instruments used in this context do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Where specic hedges are used in geared joint ventures to x the interest exposure on limited-recourse debt, these qualify for hedge accounting.
At 31 March 2011, the Group including joint ventures had 0.7bn 2010: 1.1bn of interest rate swaps in place, and its net debt was 92.1% xed 2010: 98.2%.
Based on year end Group debt balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would increase the net interest payable in the income statement by 4.3m.
At 31 March 2010, all Group debt was xed and accordingly interest payable in the income statement was not sensitive to movements in interest rates.
The sensitivity has been calculated by applying the interest rate change to the variable rate borrowings, net of interest-rate swaps and cash and cash equivalents.
Foreign exchange Foreign-exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the Groups functional currency.
The Group does not normally enter into any foreign-currency transactions as it is UK based.
However, where committed expenditure in foreign currencies is identied, it is the Groups policy to hedge 100% of that exposure by entering into forward purchases of foreign currency to x the Sterling value.
Therefore, the Groups foreignexchange risk is low.
The Group had no foreign-currency exposure at 31 March 2011 or at 31 March 2010.
