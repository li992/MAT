Derivative financial instruments An outline of the groups financial risks and the objectives and policies pursued in relation to those risks is set out in Note 26.
In the normal course of business the group enters into derivative financial instruments derivatives to manage its normal business exposures in relation to commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between oating rate and xed rate debt, consistent with risk management policies and objectives.
Additionally, the group has a well-established entrepreneurial trading operation that is undertaken in conjunction with these activities using a similar range of contracts.
IAS 39 prescribes strict criteria for hedge accounting, whether as a cash ow or fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, and requires that any derivative that does not meet these criteria should be classied as held for trading and fair valued, with gains and losses recognized in the income statement.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments at 31 December are set out below.

Derivative financial instruments continued Derivatives held for trading The group maintains active trading positions in a variety of derivatives.
The contracts may be entered into for risk management purposes, to satisfy supply requirements or for entrepreneurial trading.
Certain contracts are classied as held for trading, regardless of their original business objective, and are recognized at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the income statement.
Trading activities are undertaken by using a range of contract types in combination to create incremental gains by arbitraging prices between markets, locations and time periods.
The net of these exposures is monitored using market value-at-risk techniques as described in Note 26.
The following tables show further information on the fair value of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
Derivative assets held for trading have the following fair values and maturities.

This deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement over the life of the contract until substantially all of the remaining contract term can be valued using observable market data at which point any remaining deferred gain or loss is recognized in the income statement.
Changes in valuation from this initial valuation are recognized immediately through the income statement.

IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures sets out a fair value hierarchy which consists of three levels that describe the methodology of estimation as follows: Level 1 using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 using inputs for the asset or liability, other than quoted prices, that are observable either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices.
Level 3 using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data such as prices based on internal models or other valuation methods.
This information is presented on a gross basis, that is, before netting by counterparty.
Derivative financial instruments continued The following table shows the changes during the year in the net fair value of derivatives held for trading purposes within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The amount recognized in the income statement for the year relating to level 3 held for trading derivatives still held at 31 December 2011 was a $204 million gain 2010 $651 million gain relating to derivatives still held at 31 December 2010.
Gains and losses relating to derivative contracts are included either within sales and other operating revenues or within purchases in the income statement depending upon the nature of the activity and type of contract involved.
The contract types treated in this way include futures, options, swaps and certain forward sales and forward purchases contracts, and relate to both currency and commodity trading activities.
Gains or losses arise on contracts entered into for risk management purposes, optimization activity and entrepreneurial trading.
They also arise on certain contracts that are for normal procurement or sales activity for the group but that are required to be fair valued under accounting standards.
Also included within sales and other operating revenues are gains and losses on inventory held for trading purposes.
The total amount relating to all of these items was a net loss of $934 million 2010 $1,738 million net gain and 2009 $4,046 million net gain.
Embedded derivatives The group has embedded derivatives relating to certain natural gas contracts.
Prior to the development of an active gas trading market, UK gas contracts were priced using a basket of available price indices, primarily relating to oil products, power and ination.
After the development of an active UK gas market, certain contracts were entered into or renegotiated using pricing formulae not directly related to gas prices, for example, oil product and power prices.
In these circumstances, pricing formulae have been determined to be derivatives, embedded within the overall contractual arrangements that are not clearly and closely related to the underlying commodity.
The resulting fair value relating to these contracts is recognized on the balance sheet with gains or losses recognized in the income statement.
All the commodity price embedded derivatives relate to natural gas contracts, are categorized in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy and are valued using inputs that include price curves for each of the different products that are built up from active market pricing data.
Where necessary, these are extrapolated to the expiry of the contracts the last of which is in 2018 using all available external pricing information.
Additionally, where limited data exists for certain products, prices are interpolated using historic and long-term pricing relationships.
In addition, at 31 December 2010, BP was party to a collar-backed nancing arrangement involving an available-for-sale investment held by the group.
This arrangement contained an embedded derivative whose fair value was related to the equity price of the investment and was categorized in level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The arrangement was terminated in 2011.

Note 26 outlines the management of risk aspects for currency risk.
For cash ow hedges the group only claims hedge accounting for the intrinsic value on the currency with any fair value attributable to time value taken immediately to the income statement.
There were no highly probable transactions for which hedge accounting has been claimed that have not occurred and no significant element of hedge ineffectiveness requiring recognition in the income statement.
For cash ow hedges the pre-tax amount removed from equity during the period and included in the income statement is a gain of $195 million 2010 gain of $25 million and 2009 loss of $366 million.
The entire gain of $195 million is included in production and manufacturing expenses 2010 $25 million gain in production and manufacturing expense: 2009 $332 million loss in production and manufacturing expense and $34 million loss in finance costs.
The amount removed from equity during the period and included in the carrying amount of non-financial assets was a gain of $13 million 2010 $53 million loss and 2009 $136 million loss.
The amounts retained in equity at 31 December 2011 consist of deferred losses of $78 million maturing in 2012, deferred losses of $39 million maturing in 2013 and deferred losses of $30 million maturing in 2014 and beyond.
Fair value hedges At 31 December 2011, the group held interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate risk on xed rate debt issued by the group.
The effectiveness of each hedge relationship is quantitatively assessed and demonstrated to continue to be highly effective.
The gain on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in 2011 was $328 million 2010 $563 million gain and 2009 $98 million loss offset by a loss on the fair value of the finance debt of $327 million 2010 $554 million loss and 2009 $117 million gain.
The interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps mature within one to 10 years, with an average maturity of four to five years 2010 four to five years and are used to convert sterling, euro, Swiss franc, Australian dollar, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollar denominated borrowings into US dollar oating rate debt.
Note 26 outlines the groups approach to interest rate and currency risk management.
