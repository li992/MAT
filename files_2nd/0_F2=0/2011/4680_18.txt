Financial risk management and financial instruments Financial risk management The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks associated with interest rate, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and capital.
It is the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year, are consistent with the previous year, and are summarised below: Market risk a Interest rate risk The groups interest rate risk arises from borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, together with currency swaps used to hedge intercompany loans.
The group borrows in the desired currencies at floating rates of interest and may use forward rate agreements or interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Although group policy permits the hedging of up to 50% of interest rate exposures on borrowings for a period not exceeding five years, no interest rate hedging was in place at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
Cash is held in interest-bearing current accounts where practicable, and all deposits are for periods of less than three months.
A variation of, for example, 100 basis points in interest rates, applied to the groups borrowings, cash and short-term deposits at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010, would result in a movement in finance costs of 303,000 2010: 172,000 and finance income of 76,000 2010: 50,000.
This would result in a post-tax impact on the groups income statement of 164,000 2010: 88,000. b Foreign exchange risk The group has several significant overseas subsidiary undertakings whose revenues and expenses are denominated in a variety of currencies.
Group policy dictates that foreign currency exposures arising from future commercial transactions are reviewed by Group Treasury and hedging activities are undertaken as appropriate in order to manage the net foreign exchange risks arising.
Group policy permits the hedging of up to a maximum of 80% of the net external currency transaction exposures for periods of up to a maximum of fifteen months forward.
It is not group policy to routinely hedge translation exposures apart from inter-company loans.
Specific Board approval is required for any other translation exposure hedging.
The table below details the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on the groups post-tax profit for the year ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 and equity at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
The gains and losses arise from translating receivables, payables, cash and derecognised currency hedges which are denominated in currencies other than each group companys reporting currency.
The movements in equity arise from the translation of cash flow currency hedges.
In each case, it is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the other currencies remain constant.
The percentage foreign currency movement is based on the experience of the previous four years.
Results are shown for all currencies where the impact on group post-tax profits would be more than 50,000.
Financial risk management and financial instruments continued Credit risk Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures with customers.
The group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The group monitors its credit exposure using credit ratings, where applicable, and through its policy of requiring appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence.
These procedures limit the groups exposure to any one party to approved levels.
The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each class of receivable.
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
Liquidity risk The group has medium-term loan facilities which are regularly reviewed to ensure that they provide adequate liquidity for the group.
The facilities are managed on a centralised basis with appropriate local availability.
Details of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 are shown below: 2011 2010 000 000 Expiring in more than one year but less than two years 35,828 Expiring in more than two years 22,897 22,897 35,828 At 31 December 2011, the group had in place unsecured floating rate loan facilities comprising committed elements with a total of 51.0 million 2010: 51.0 million.
These facilities were negotiated in September 2011 and are due to expire on 30 September 2016.
These are co-ordinated bilateral facilities with four banks.
The group also has uncommitted working capital facilities of 5.0 million 2010: 7.0 million.
The uncommitted facilities are renewable within one year.
The group was in compliance with the covenants related to its loan facilities throughout the years ending 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010.
In addition to the group facilities, local uncommitted facilities of US dollars 2.0 million 2010: US dollars 2.0 million, Czech koruna 90.0 million 2010: Czech koruna 60.0 million and Australian dollars 0.5 million 2010: nil were also in place at 31 December 2011.
These facilities are renewable within one year.
Capital risk When managing capital, the groups objectives are to safeguard the business as a going concern, provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an optimal capital structure.
In order to maintain the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The principal measure used to monitor the strength of the groups balance sheet is the gearing ratio, which expresses the groups net debt as a percentage of its net assets.
Net debt is total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents.
Net assets are as shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
The gearing ratios at 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 were as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Total borrowings note 22 30,316 17,966 Less: cash and cash equivalents note 19 7,614 5,789 Net debt note 33 22,702 12,177 Net assets 140,479 153,000 Gearing ratio 16.2% 8.0% 65 | Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 23.

Retirement benefit obligations The amounts recognised as charges credits in the income statement continuing and discontinued operations, are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Pension obligations Defined benefit schemes: Current service cost 799 899 Net finance income costs 1,111 1,217 312 2,116 Defined contribution schemes 1,360 1,265 1,048 3,381 The amounts recognised as non-current liabilities in the balance sheet are as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Pension obligations Fair value of scheme assets 196,617 198,518 Present value of funded obligations 242,775 211,923 46,158 13,405 Pension obligations The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type and, with the exception of Germany where book reserves are supported by insurance policies, the assets of the schemes are held in separate trusteeadministered funds.
The defined benefit schemes are closed to new members.
On the advice of the actuaries, cash contributions to the groups defined benefit schemes are expected to be 5.8 million for the year ending 31 December 2012 2011: 5.2 million.
The most significant defined benefit scheme within the group is the Devro Limited UK Pension Plan, which operates in the United Kingdom.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2008.
The other major defined benefit schemes operate in Australia and the United States.
Actuarial assumptions appropriate for each country have been used.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the groups material defined benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2011 by qualified independent actuaries.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in the following principal countries were: Australia United Kingdom United States 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 % % % % % % Discount rate 3.20 4.90 4.70 5.40 4.52 5.31 Rate of increase in salaries 4.00 4.00 1.00 1.00 General inflation 2.50 2.50 3.10 3.40 2.50 2.60 As part of the changes to the United Kingdom plan agreed in 2010, future pensionable salary increases are capped at 1% per annum.
No rate of increase in salaries has been assumed in respect of the United States plan as the plan is now frozen.
The expected return on scheme assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the period for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligations.
71 | Devro plc Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2011 continued 25.
Retirement benefit obligations continued Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy plan experience.
These assumptions are under continual review.
The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2011 are based on the following tables: Years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65 2011 2010 Male Female Male Female United Kingdom PA92 mc YOB 1% underpin 2 21.9 24.1 20.9 24.0 United States RP-2000 healthy projected to 2011 19.1 21.0 18.9 20.8 The Australian defined benefit scheme provides only for a lump sum payment on retirement.
In addition to the above schemes, the group operates a defined benefit retirement plan in Germany which, in common with typical practice in that country, is supported by insurance policies.
At 31 December 2011, the value of the insurance asset was 2.5 million 2010: 4.2 million and the value of the liability was 2.7 million 2010: 4.4 million.
As mentioned in note 5, a proportion of the assets and liabilities of the German plan, relating to the period when the business operated as a branch of Devro Inc or Devro Scotland Limited, was retained by the group after the sale of Devro GmbH.
In addition, the group has benefit arrangements in respect of two former executives in the United States for which the group has made adequate provisions on the advice of the actuaries.
There is also an individual pension arrangement in Japan in respect of which appropriate contributions are made annually.
The plan in Germany and these additional arrangements in the United States and Japan are included under the other heading in this note.
During the year the value of the scheme assets was relatively stable.
However, the present value of the pension liabilities increased as a result of the fall in discount rates.
The UK scheme is the largest of the schemes and the discount rate decreased from 5.4% to 4.7% in 2011, generating around 25 million of additional net liabilities.
In 2010, the UK scheme was restructured which has helped limit the volatility and resulted in the exceptional credit of 18,851,000 in that year.
Work is ongoing with advisers to look at developing the group pension strategy in order to manage the underlying risks.
Further additional contributions will be made to the schemes in 2012 to reduce the deficit.
The results of the triennial valuation for the UK scheme as at 31 March 2011 will be concluded in the first half of 2012.
The group continues to pay contributions to retirement schemes in accordance with local regulatory requirements and on the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
The actuaries continually review the funding position of the schemes.

Share-based payments Under the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan the plan, the Executive Directors Remuneration Committee can make provisional allocations of ordinary shares in the company to employees of the group, including Executive Directors.
No payment for an allocation is made by a participant.
Allocations normally vest over a three-year period, are conditional on the continued employment of the participant and are subject to certain performance conditions.
These performance conditions relate to growth in operating profit of the subsidiary undertaking in which the participant is employed, growth in earnings per share of the group, the companys Total Shareholder Return, or a combination of these.
The fair value of an allocation represents the market value of the ordinary shares in the company on the date of the provisional allocation, less the discounted value of estimated dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period.
A participant is not entitled to receive dividends during this period.
Amounts provided in the accounts are based on an estimate of the probability of the targets in respect of allocations being achieved.
During the year, 1,381,557 shares vested under the plan 2010: 742,730.
