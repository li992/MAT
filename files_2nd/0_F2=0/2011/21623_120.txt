v Liquidity and credit risk This is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting obligations associated with financial liabilities.
Management of the risk Liquidity and credit risk is not significant as the majority of the Groups assets are investments in quoted equities and other quoted securities that are readily realisable.
The Group has an overdraft facility of 30 million 2010: 30 million and a multi-currency loan facility of 120 million 2010: 70 million.
The Board gives guidance to the Investment Manager as to the maximum amounts of the Groups resources that should be invested in any one company.
The policy is that the Group should remain 75% invested in normal market conditions and that 25% of the Groups assets may be invested in cash or cash equivalents.
Short term borrowings may be used to manage short term cash requirements.
