Goodwill continued The recoverable amount of each of the CGUs is based on value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding expected cash ows arising in future periods, regional growth rates and the discount rates.
Future cash ow projections are based on the most recent Board approved financial budgets for 2012 which are used to project cash ows for the next five years.
After this period a steady state cash ow is used to derive a terminal value for the CGU.
Allocated goodwill has an inde nite life and this is re ected in the calculation of the CGUs terminal value.
Estimated average growth rates, based on the regions constituent country growth rates as published by the World Bank, are used to estimate cash ows after the budgeted period.
The growth rates used were 2.16% for Europe, 2.93% for Americas and 3.93% for Asia.
Resultant cash ows have been discounted at a pre-tax discount rate of 11.5% 2010: 11.5%.
The calculations of value in use have been subject to stress tests demonstrating that the impairment test results are tolerant to reasonably possible changes in assumptions as to discount rate and future cash ows.

In respect of trade receivables, the Group is not exposed to signi cant credit risk to a single counterparty or any group of counterparties.
Matched Principal brokerage transactions, whereby securities are bought from one counterparty and sold to another counterparty, are settled on a Delivery versus Payment basis.
The above analysis re ects only the receivable side of such transactions, the other side being shown in trade and other payables.
Settlement of such transactions typically takes place within a few business days according to the relevant market rules and conventions and the credit risk is considered to be minimal.

Share-based payments As at 31 December 2011 the Group had one active equity-based long term incentive plan, the Tullett Prebon Long Term Incentive Plan, for the granting of non-transferable awards to certain employees and executives.
Option awards granted under the plan typically become exercisable three years after grant date.
The exercise of certain options is dependent on option holders meeting performance criteria.
The maximum life of the options is 10 years after grant date.
Options are settled in equity once exercised.
Share awards are granted to certain employees within the Group and are transferred to them on completion of the awards performance criteria.
Outstanding awards at 31 December 2011 and their estimated fair values when granted are set out below: Estimated Awards fair outstanding value at 2011 grant date Awards 1 Long term incentive award 2009 429,980 199p 1 Long term incentive award 2010 797,266 169p 1 Long term incentive award 2011 557,501 246p 2 Long term incentive award 2011 44,761 309p 1,829,508 Notes: 1 Subject to total shareholder return and return on capital conditions.

No share options were exercised in 2011.
The weighted average share price of exercises in 2010 was 353p.
The estimated fair value of each option granted under the long term incentive awards 2009, 2010 and 2011 which are subject to market conditions, were calculated by applying a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The model inputs were the share price at grant date, exercise price, expected volatility, expected dividends based on historical dividend payment, the expected life of the option until exercise, a risk-free interest rate based on government securities with a similar maturity pro le and the volatility and correlation of Total Shareholder Return TSR with a comparator group of companies.
The 2010 and 2011 awards are also subject to TSR comparison relative to the UK Retail Price Index.

Acquisitions a Subsidiaries acquired during the year Conveno S A Corretora fide Valores e Cmbio Conveno On 9 August 2011 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Conveno, an inter-dealer broker based in Brazil.
The consideration paid on completion was R$20.0m 7.8m.
Further deferred and performance related consideration is payable over the next three years, the acquisition fair value of which was estimated to be R$12.1m 4.8m and R$11.6m 4.5m respectively.
The undiscounted maximum payable for deferred and performance related consideration is R$35.5m 13.9m.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition was R$41.3m 16.2m attributable to the expected business synergies within Americas and obtaining a pre-existing, well-respected business in the Latin American market.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The business combination has been accounted for using the acquisition method.

Acquisitions continued The amounts recognised in respect of the identi able assets acquired and liabilities assumed are as set out in the table below: m Identi able assets and liabilities acquired: Fixed and intangible assets 0.5 Trade and other receivables 2.4 Other financial assets 3.4 Cash and cash equivalents 1.3 Trade and other payables 1.5 Taxation 2.6 Provisions 2.6 Total identi able assets 0.9 Goodwill 16.2 Total consideration 17.1 Satis ed by: Cash consideration 7.8 Fair value of deferred consideration 4.8 Fair value of contingent consideration 4.5 17.1 Net cash out ow arising on acquisition Cash consideration 7.8 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 1.3 6.5 Goodwill arising on acquisition 16.2 Effect of changes in exchange rates 1.9 Included in goodwill as at 31 December 2011 14.3 Costs relating to the acquisition of Conveno have been recognised in administrative expenses as incurred.
Costs incurred in 2011 amounted to 0.2m with 1.4m having been expensed in prior periods.
Convenos revenue in the period since acquisition was 5.4m with earnings of 0.3m.
The Groups revenue for the year, had Conveno been acquired on 1 January 2011, would have been 7.7m higher and earnings 0.4m higher.
Other acquisitions during the year Newedge USA LLC Newedge On 3 January 2011 one of the Groups US subsidiaries hired a team of brokers which formed Newedge USA LLCs credit products inter-dealer brokering business.
As part of that arrangement a cash payment of US$6.5m 4.1m was made representing the goodwill associated with that businesss activities.
No further consideration is payable.
The fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired were negligible, resulting in the recognition of goodwill of US$6.5m 4.1m, attributable to the highly skilled workforce and the businesss reputation.
The Newedge business has been fully integrated into the Groups operations, and it is therefore considered impracticable to show the revenue and earnings for the period after the date of acquisition or for the full year as if acquired from the beginning of the year.
Tullett Prebon plc Annual Report 2011 80 Tullett Liberty Bahrain Co. W. L. L. Tullett Liberty Bahrain For a number of years the Group has been entitled to 85% of Tullett Liberty Bahrain s trading results, and due to not having control over the financial and operating policies the entity was accounted for as an associate of the Group.
Following shareholder agreement the Group obtained control over the financial and operating policies and has accounted for the entity as a subsidiary as of 1 July 2011.
The acquisition date fair value of Groups previous interest was 0.4m resulting in a gain of 0.3m being recognised in other gains and losses.
The interests of the non-controlling shareholders, measured at their share of the fair value of the identi able net assets, amounted to 0.2m which is included as an increase to minority equity interests in reserves.
No additional consideration was transferred.
The fair value of the identi able assets and liabilities acquired amounted to 0.6m, resulting in no goodwill being recognised in the period.
On 3 January 2012 the Groups shareholding was increased to 85% of the issued ordinary voting shares aligning the shareholding with the 85% entitlement to the trading results.
Tullett Liberty Bahrain earned revenue of 1.6m and earnings of 0.4m in the period since acquisition.
The Groups revenue for the year, had Tullett Liberty Bahrain been acquired on 1 January 2011 would have been 1.8m higher with earnings unchanged.
Acquisitions after 31 December 2011 Chapdelaine & Co. On 3 January 2012, the Group acquired 100% of the membership interests of Chapdelaine & Co. this entity being the owner of Chapdelaine Municipal Brokers Inc. and Chapdelaine & Co. Municipal Securities Inc.
The initial consideration paid was US$10.2m 6.6m in cash.
The initial fair value of the net assets acquired is estimated to be US$2.7m 1.7m, which would result in the recognition of US$7.5m 4.9m to be allocated between goodwill and identi able intangible assets.
b Analysis of deferred and contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions Certain acquisitions made by the Group are satis ed in part by deferred or contingent deferred consideration.
The Group has re-estimated the amounts due where necessary, with any corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill for acquisitions prior to 1 January 2010, and to pro t or loss for acquisitions after that date.

The majority of current and future pensions receive xed increases in payment of either 0% or 2.5%.
2 In 2011 the basis for the in ation assumption was changed to CPI from RPI.
The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements and are the same as those adopted for the 2010 funding valuations.
For the Tullett Liberty Pension Scheme the assumptions are that a member who retires in future at age 60 will live on average for a further 28 years 2010: 28 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 31 years 2010: 31 years after retirement if they are female.
