Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding.
As a result of the demerger, Spirit Pub Company plc became the new parent of the Spirit Pub Company businesses.
Therefore the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding has been calculated using the number of ordinary shares issued by the Spirit Pub Company plc to the shareholders of Punch Taverns plc at the date of the demerger 1 August 2011 and adjusted for: movements in the number of ordinary shares of Spirit Group Holdings Limited in the prior period to 21 August 2010 and from 21 August 2010 to the date of demerger: and movements in the number of ordinary shares outstanding from the demerger date to 20 August 2011 using the actual number of ordinary shares of the Spirit Pub Company plc outstanding during that period.
The weighted average number of shares is 659.7 million throughout the reported period.
