86 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Earnings per share The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The underlying earnings per share figures have also been calculated based on earnings before profits and losses on the disposal of properties, impairment charges, pension credits arising on changes of the defined benefit pension schemes, and non-cash fair value movements in financial instruments, and costs relating to strategic changes that are not considered normal operating costs of the underlying business see note 5.
These have been calculated to allow the shareholders to gain an understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one class of dilutive potential ordinary shares being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
