On January 25, 2011 Northern Star Mining Corp. announced that it had been deemed to have filed assignments in bankruptcy.
The Group has registered its royalty interests against the Malartic-Midway and McKenzie Break tenures and continues to pursue its rights with the receiver to ensure that the royalty remains attached to the property in the event of any disposal.
Given the inherent uncertainty over the Groups ability to retain the royalty through the bankruptcy, a provision against the royalty instrument has been made.
On October 18, 2011 Mundo Minerals Limited Mundo announced the decision to place the Engenho project on care and maintenance by December 2011.
Mundo further announced on December 16, 2011 that its Brazilian subsidiary which holds the mining licences relating to the Engenho project was seeking protection from its creditors under a Brazilian Chapter 11 equivalent.
The Group will pursue its rights under the terms of the convertible debenture.
