Factors affecting the tax charge credit for the year The tax rate assessed for the year is higher 2010: lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 27.5% 2010: 28.0%.
The differences are explained below: 2011 2010 m m Loss before tax 11.5 162.9 Loss before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax of 27.5% 2010: 28.0% 3.2 45.6 Effects of: Other expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.4 1.3 Additional tax relief for land remediation costs 1.7 1.6 Adjustment in respect of previous years 2.9 1.5 Tax in respect of joint ventures 0.1 0.4 Tax on share-based payments 0.2 0.5 Impact of change in tax rate on deferred tax asset 9.6 Tax charge credit for the year 2.3 44.5 Legislation reducing the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 26% with effect from 1 April 2011 was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011.
Accordingly, the current year tax charge has been provided for at an effective rate of 27.5% and the closing deferred tax asset has been provided for at a rate of 26% in these financial statements.
An additional reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012 was enacted within the Finance Act 2011 on 5July 2011.
As this reduction was not substantively enacted by the balance sheet date, its effect has not been reflected in these financial statements.
Further reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of 1% per annum to 23% by 1 April 2014 have been announced by the Government but have not yet been substantively enacted, therefore their effect has not been reflected in these financial statements.
The proposed reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 26% to 23% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately each year.
Ifthe deferred tax assets and liabilities of the Group were all to reverse after 2014, the effect of the reduction from 26% to 23% would be to reduce the net deferred tax asset by 16.5m.
To the extent that the net deferred tax asset reverses more quickly than this, the impact of the rate reductions on the net deferred tax asset will be reduced.
