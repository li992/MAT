Mining method: OP Open Pit, UG Underground.
Mine Life The extraction period in years for scheduled Ore Reserves comprising Proved and Probable Reserves only.
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
1 Quellaveco: During 2011 no new drilling was completed at Quellaveco project, therefore Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources remain unchanged.
The sub-product estimated grade for molybdenum is 0.019% for Ore Reserves, while the average estimated grade for Mineral Resources is 0.016%.
2 Mantoverde Sulphide Project: Drilling information, a higher copper price and an acquisition of Laura-Laurita-Las Casas sector resulted in the increase of Mineral Resources.
3 Pebble: The Mineral Resources are based on drilling to May 2009 and a block model nalised in December 2009.
Reported Mineral Resources fall within a volume dened by resource price estimates and are based on a cut-off grade of 0.40% CuEq.
Calculation of copper equivalent CuEq is based on Long Term metal prices and takes into consideration the recovery of Copper, Gold and Molybdenum.
At a cut-off of 0.60% CuEq the estimate of Measured Resources is 278 Mt at 0.40% Cu, 0.42 g t Au, 0.020% Mo while the estimate of Indicated Resources is 3,319 Mt at 0.55% Cu, 0.42g t Au, 0.030% Mo.
4 Pebble co-product estimated grades 2011 Measured : Gold 0.36g t, Molybdenum 0.018%, CuEq average grade 0.66%.
5 Pebble co-product estimated grades 2011 Indicated : Gold 0.37g t, Molybdenum 0.027%, CuEq average grade 0.85%.
6 Pebble co-product estimated grades 2011 Inferred : Gold 0.31g t, Molybdenum 0.026%, CuEq average grade 0.67%.
7 Pebble: The property comprises 2,042 located Alaska State mineral claims which total 209,996 acres 84,982 hectares and which are currently valid.
8 Los Sulfatos: The development of Tunel Sur, an 8km exploration tunnel that provides safe access to continue drilling the deposit, was completed in 2011.
During 2012 drill stations are planned to be excavated, whilst further exploration and resource drilling is expected to start in 2013.
The reported resources include mineralisation inside a 1% nominal copper grade cut-off envelope down to the current drillhole depths of 1,000 metres below surface.
The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
9 San Enrique Monolito: The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
10 West Wall: The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an open pit operation to a depth of 600m below surface.
