Interest of 5% will be paid annually up until that settlement date.
The net proceeds received from the issue of the convertible bonds have been split between the financial liability element estimated at the time of issue using the prevailing market interest rate for similar non-convertible debt and an equity component of $11,586,000 before expenses of $315,000 representing the fair value of the embedded option to convert the financial liability into equity of the Company.

Financial risk management The Groups Board of Directors monitors and manages the financial risks relating to the operations of the Group through an internal risk register.
These include commodity, foreign exchange, credit, liquidity and interest rate risks.
Commodity price risk The Groups policy is to consider oil and gas price hedging when and where it is economically attractive to lock in prices at levels that protect the cash flow of the Salamander Group, its business plan and debt related coverage ratios.
All hedging transactions to date have been related directly to expected cash flows and no speculative transactions have been undertaken.
For 2011, the Groups oil production was all sold at prices relative to the spot market.
2011 production was hedged with put options for 4,000 bopd with a price of $60.00 per barrel, all of which expired in 2011.
During September 2011 the Group purchased put options for 1,800 bopd with a price of $70.00 per barrel and swaps for 1,800 bopd with an average swap price of $103 per barrel.
During 2011, 77% of the Groups gas production its Indonesian gas production was sold at fixed prices under long term contracts with the balance its Thai gas production sold at prices based on a formula related to spot medium sulphur fuel oil prices.
The Group held no hedges with respect to its gas production during 2011.
The key variable which affects the fair value of the Groups hedging instruments is market expectations about future commodity prices.
The following illustrates the sensitivity on hedging mark-to-market values to net income and equity to a 20% increase and a 20% decrease in this variable a positive sign indicates a positive effect on net income and vice versa : Increase decrease to mark-to-market value 2011 2010 Oil Oil $000s $000s 20% increase 13,722 256 20% decrease 15,394 1,165 90 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 25 Derivative financial instruments continued Foreign exchange risk The Group undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies, hence exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise.
Exchange rate exposures are managed through maintaining the majority of the Groups cash and cash equivalent balances in US Dollars, the Groups presentational currency and the functional currency of all its subsidiaries.
The Group also holds, from time to time, cash balances in UK Pounds Sterling and other currencies to meet short term commitments in those currencies.
The carrying amounts of the Groups foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date are as follows: Asset Liabilities 2011 2010 2011 2010 $000s $000s $000s $000s UK Pounds Sterling 1,711 2,316 1,983 2,469 Singapore Dollar 528 5,888 154 114 Indonesian Rupiah 25,122 26,434 3,357 3,597 Thailand Baht 17,409 33,332 6,619 70,790 Vietnamese Dong 878 1,094 490 458 The following table details the Groups sensitivity to a 20% increase or decrease in the US Dollar against the relevant foreign currency.
The sensitivity analysis includes only foreign currency denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the year end for a 20% change in the foreign currency rate.
A positive number below indicates an increase in profit after tax where the US Dollar strengthens by 20% against the relevant currency.
For a 20% weakening of the US Dollar against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and opposite impact on the profit after tax and the balances below would be negative.

The Group is exposed to the following credit and counterparty risks.
In respect of cash and cash equivalents, the Groups principal financial asset, the credit risk is deemed limited because the majority of the cash and cash equivalents are deposited with banks with AA or AAcredit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies, as set out in note 20.
In respect of the Groups trade sales, the Group manages credit risk through dealing with, whenever possible, either international energy companies or state owned companies based in Thailand and Indonesia, and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate.
The Group consistently monitors counterparty credit risk.
The carrying value of financial assets recorded in the Financial Statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk at the year end without taking account of any collateral obtained.
In addition, the Groups operations are typically structured via contractual joint venture arrangements.
As such the Group is reliant on joint venture partners to fund their capital or other funding obligations in relation to assets and operations which are not yet cash generative.
The Group closely monitors the risks and maintains a close dialogue with those counterparties considered to be highest risk in this regard.
91 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 25 Derivative financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group manages its liquidity risk by maintaining adequate cash and cash equivalents, and borrowing facilities to meet its forecast short, medium and long term commitments.
The Group continually monitors its actual and forecast cash flows to ensure that there are adequate reserves and banking facilities to meet the maturing profiles of its financial assets and liabilities.
The following tables detail the Groups remaining contractual maturities for its non-derivative financial liabilities.
The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date the Group was required to pay at the balance sheet date.
The table includes both interest and principal cash flows.
The following table details the Groups remaining contractual maturities for its derivative financial liabilities: 2011 Less than 13 3 months 1 month months to 1 year Total $000s $000s $000s $000s Oil collar 176 302 105 373 Interest rate swap 33 66 296 395 Total 209 368 191 768 Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate movements through its lendings, bank borrowings and cash and cash equivalent deposits, which are at rates fixed to LIBOR.
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the Groups exposure to an interest rate movement and is prepared assuming the amount of the net debt and interest rate swaps outstanding at the balance sheet date were outstanding for the whole year.
92 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 25 Derivative financial instruments continued Interest rate risk continued For net debt, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have increased or decreased by $1.1 million 2010: $0.9 million respectively.
This is principally attributable to the Group maintaining a lower cash and cash equivalents position as described in note 20.
For interest rate swaps, if interest rates had been 1% higher or lower and all other variables were held constant, the Groups loss after tax for the year ended 31 December 2011 would have decreased or increased by $0.6 million and $0.2 million respectively 2010: decreased or increased by $0.8 million and $0.3 million respectively.
Fair value of financial instruments Fair value of financial instruments carries at amortised cost The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of financial assets and liabilities recorded at amortised cost in the Financial Statements approximate their fair values.
Valuation techniques and assumptions applied for the purposes of measuring fair value The fair values of financial assets and liabilities are determined as follows: The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities with standard terms and conditions and traded on active liquid markets are determined with reference to quoted market prices includes listed redeemable notes, bills of exchange, debentures and perpetual notes.
The fair values of other financial assets and financial liabilities excluding derivative instruments are determined in accordance with generally accepted pricing models based on discounted cash flow analysis using prices from observable current market transactions and dealer quotes for similar instruments.
The fair values of derivative instruments are calculated using quoted prices.
Where such prices are not available, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed using the applicable yield curve for the duration of the instruments for non-optional derivatives, and option pricing models for optional derivatives.
Foreign currency forward contracts are measured using quoted forward exchange rates and yield curves derived from quoted interest rates matching maturities of the contracts.
Interest rate swaps are measured at the present value of future cash flows estimated and discounted based on the applicable yield curves derived from quoted interest rates.
Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The following list provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable: Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets and liabilities: Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly i. e. as prices or indirectly i. e. derived from prices : and Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data unobservable inputs.

94 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 28 Share option schemes and share based payment Performance Share Plan The Company has an equity-settled share option scheme for employees called the Salamander Energy Performance Share Plan PSP.
Further details of the PSP are set out in the Remuneration Report.
Awards under the PSP may be satisfied by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
In any ten year period, the Company may not issue or have the possibility to issue more than 10% of the issued capital of the Company pursuant to awards granted under the PSP and any other rights granted under any other employee share plan adopted by the Company.
Shares held in treasury will count as new issue shares for the purposes of the above limits unless institutional bodies decide that they need not count.
Shares purchased in the market will not, however, count towards the limit described above.
Movement in PSP shares during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 Shares Weighted Shares Weighted under option average price under option average price Number s Number s Outstanding at 1 January 4,748,426 0.10 3,860,196 0.10 Granted during the Year 1,025,685 0.10 1,329,621 0.10 Exercised during the Year 781,583 0.10 441,391 0.10 Lapsed during the Year 316,388 0.10 Outstanding at 31 December 4,676,140 0.10 4,748,426 0.10 Exercisable at 31 December 56,575 269,678 The expense recognised for unvested employee share options of $3,654,300 2010: $2,348,200 relates wholly to equity-settled share based payment arising from grants made under the PSP.
Of this amount, $801,000 2010: $324,000 was capitalised as being directly attributable to capital and other projects.
At 31 December 2011, the total future expense relating to unvested awards not yet recognised was $4,116,685, which is expected to be recognised over the following three years.
The weighted average market price of shares at the date of exercise was 2.61.
Outstanding share options at 31 December 2011 will vest between 2012 and 2014 subject to the vesting criteria.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year, as estimated at the date of grant, was 2.27 per share 2010: 1.67.
This was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on the following assumptions: 2011 2010 Weighted average share price at date of grant 3.10 2.36 Exercise price 0.10 0.10 Expected volatility 65% 68% Expected life 3 years 3 years Expected dividend 0% 0% Risk-free interest rate 1.64% 1.83% There is a 12 month window for exercise.
However, as the exercise price is nominal it is assumed that recipients exercise at the end of the performance period.
Therefore, an expected life of three years after the date of grant has been assumed.
95 Financial statements Salamander Energy PLC Annual Report 2011 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 28 Share option schemes and share based payment continued Deferred Equity Plan The Company also has another equity-settled share option scheme for employees called the Salamander Energy Deferred Equity Plan DEP.
The DEP follows a similar principle to the PSP scheme, but removes the requirement of a comparator group with shares settled after a period of two years by the issue of new shares, or the transfer of shares from the Companys treasury or shares purchased in the market.
Movement in DEP shares during the year was as follows: 2011 2010 Shares Weighted Shares Weighted under option average price under option average price Number s Number s Outstanding at 1 January 239,457 0.10 0.10 Granted during the year 533,160 0.10 239,457 0.10 Exercised during the year 0.10 0.10 Lapsed during the year 0.10 Outstanding at 31 December 772,617 0.10 239,457 0.10 Exercisable at 31 December The expense recognised for unvested employee share options of $1,263,700 2010: $213,800 relates wholly to equity-settled share based payment arising from grants made under the DEP.
Of this amount, $281,000 2010: $146,000 was capitalised as being directly attributable to capital and other projects.
At 31 December 2011, the total future expense relating to unvested awards not yet recognised was $1,706,779, which is expected to be recognised over the following two years.
Outstanding share options at 31 December 2011 will vest between 2012 and 2013 subject to the vesting criteria.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year, as estimated at the date of grant, was 3.03 per share 2010: 1.67.
This was calculated using a Monte Carlo simulation model based on the following assumptions: 2011 2010 Weighted average share price at date of grant 3.10 2.62 Exercise price 0.10 0.10 Expected life 2 years 2 years Expected dividend 0% 0% Risk-free interest rate 1.58% 1.83% There is a 12 month window for exercise.
Therefore an expected life of two years after the date of grant has been assumed.
29 Dividends The Company has declared no dividend for the year 2010: nil.
30 Profit on disposal of subsidiary undertakings During the year the Group sold the subsidiary undertakings which held its 5% non-operated interests in the offshore North West Java and South East Sumatra PSCs.
The total net proceeds from the sale were $45,673,000 after accounting for cash movements between the effective date and closing date of the transaction, realising a gain of $6,807,000.
The entities disposed of did not qualify as a discontinued operation.
