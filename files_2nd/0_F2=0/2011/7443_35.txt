The new definitions emphasise a symmetrical view of related party relationships as well as clarifying in which circumstances persons and key management personnel affect related party relationships of an entity.
Secondly, the amendment introduces an exemption from the general related party disclosure requirements for transactions with a government and entities that are controlled, jointly controlled or significantly influenced by the same government as the reporting entity.
The adoption of the amendment did not have any impact on the financial position or performance of the Company.
IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation Classification of Rights Issues, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 February 2010: The amendment changed the definition of a financial liability in order to classify rights issues and certain options or warrants as equity instruments in cases where such rights are given pro rata to all of the existing owners of the same class of an entitys non-derivative equity instruments, or to acquire a fixed number of the entitys own equity instruments for a fixed amount in any currency.
This amendment did not have any impact on the Company after initial application.
Financial statements 157 2 Significant accounting policies continued IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement Amendment, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011: The amendment provides guidance on assessing the recoverable amount of a net pension asset.

The amendment did not have any impact on the financial statements of the Company.
IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments, applicable for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010: The interpretation clarifies that equity instruments issued to a creditor to extinguish a financial liability qualify as consideration paid.

Certain new standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards have been published and are mandatory for the Companys accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2012 or later periods but which the Company has not early adopted.
A list of these items is included in note 2 a of the Group financial statements.
e Currency translation The functional currency of the Company is the US dollar and is determined by the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company are initially recorded in the functional currency using the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are remeasured at the rate of exchange ruling at the statement of financial position date.
Exchange gains and losses on settlement of foreign currency transactions which are translated at the rate prevailing at the date of the transactions, or on the translation of monetary assets and liabilities which are translated at period-end exchange rates, are taken to the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at historical cost are translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction.
f Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Cost comprises its purchase price and directly attributable costs of acquisition or construction required to bring the asset to the condition necessary for the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management.
Economical and physical conditions of assets have not changed substantially over this period.
The cost less residual value of each item of property, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Each items estimated useful life has been assessed with regard to its own physical life.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Depreciation is charged to administrative expenses over the estimated useful life of the individual asset on a straight-line basis.
Changes in estimates are accounted for prospectively.
Depreciation commences when assets are available for use.
An assets carrying amount is written-down immediately to its recoverable amount if the assets carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised within other income expenses, in the income statement.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to be ready for its intended use are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
All other borrowing costs are expensed where incurred.
The Company capitalises borrowing costs for those assets where construction commenced on or after 1 January 2009 and continues to expense borrowing costs related to construction projects that commenced prior to 1 January 2009.
For borrowings associated with a specific asset, the actual rate on that borrowing is used.
Otherwise, a weighted average cost of borrowing is used.
The Company capitalises the borrowings cost related to qualifying assets with a value of US$1,000,000 or more, considering that the substantial period of time to be ready is six or more months.
Hochschild Mining plc 158 Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Financial statements Notes to the parent company financial statements continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued Subsequent expenditure Expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is capitalised separately with the carrying amount of the component being written-off.
Other subsequent expenditure is capitalised if future economic benefits will arise from the expenditure.
All other expenditure including repairs and maintenance expenditure are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
g Investments in subsidiaries Subsidiaries are entities over which the Company controls operating and financial policies, generally by owning more than 50% of voting rights.
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at acquisition cost less any provision for impairment.
The Company assesses investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an investment may not be recoverable.
If any such indication of impairment exists, the Company makes an estimate of its recoverable amount.
Where the carrying amount of an investment exceeds its recoverable amount, the investment is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
If, in subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed.
Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying value of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date.
h Dividends receivable Dividends are recognised when the Companys right to receive payments is established.
Dividends received are recorded in the income statement.
i Other receivables Current receivables are carried at the original amount less provision made for impairment of these receivables.
A provision for impairment of receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivable.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the original carrying amount and the recoverable amount and this difference is recognised in the income statement.
j Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents are carried in the statement of financial position at cost.
For the purposes of the statement of financial position, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits held with banks that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash within three months or less and which are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents as defined above are shown net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
k Share capital Ordinary shares issued by the Company are recorded at the net proceeds received, which is the fair value of the consideration received less costs that are incurred in connection with the share issue.
The nominal par value of the shares issued is taken to the share capital account and any excess is recorded in the share premium account, including the costs that were incurred with the share issue.
l Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present obligation legal or constructive as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
m Share-based payments Cash-settled transactions The fair value of cash-settled share plans is recognised as a liability over the vesting period of the awards.
Movements in that liability between accounting dates are recognised as an expense.
The fair value of the awards is taken to be the market value of the shares at the date of award adjusted by a factor for anticipated relative Total Shareholder Return TSR performance.
Fair values are subsequently remeasured at each accounting date to reflect the number of awards expected to vest based on the current and anticipated TSR performance.
Uncertainties in estimating the award include potential changes in the TSR, the number of participants in the plan, and levels of interest rates.
Where the Company is remunerating employees of its subsidiaries through a share-based payment, the costs of the transactions are recorded as capital contributions in the subsidiaries.
Equity-settled transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in other reserves in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Groups best estimate of the number of equity instruments that vest.
The income statement expense for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in personnel expenses.
During 2011, the Company has approved an equity-settled scheme for its CEO.
Financial statements 159 2 Significant accounting policies continued n Finance income and costs Finance income and costs mainly comprise interest income on funds invested, interest expense on borrowings, foreign exchange gains and losses, gains and losses from the change in fair value of derivative instruments and gains and losses on the disposal of available-for-sale investments.
Interest income and costs are recognised as they accrue, taking into account the effective yield on the asset and liability, respectively.
o Income tax Income tax for the year comprises current and deferred tax.
Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled based on the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
p Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Company becomes party to the contracts that give rise to them and are classified as loans or borrowings, receivables, payables, financial instruments at fair value through profit and loss or as available-for-sale financial assets, as appropriate.
The Company determines the classification of its financial assets and liabilities at initial recognition and, where allowed and appropriate, re-evaluates this designation at each financial year-end.
When financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, being the transaction price plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss and borrowings, directly attributable transaction costs.
The Company considers whether a contract contains an embedded derivative when the entity first becomes a party to it.
The embedded derivatives are separated from the host contract if it is not measured at fair value through profit or loss and when the economic characteristics and risks are not closely related to those of the host contract.
Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise be required.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, being the date that the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Regular way transactions require delivery and receipt of assets within the timeframe generally established by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
A detailed description of this policy is included in the Groups financial statements note 2 v. q Dividends distribution Dividend distribution to the Companys shareholders is recognised as a liability in the Companys financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Companys shareholders.
r Convertible bond The relevant standards within the accounting framework governing the treatment of this transaction are: a IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation and b IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
The convertible bond is a compound financial instrument that includes a financial liability and an equity instrument.
At initial recognition, the Company determines the fair value of the liability component, and the equity component as a residual amount that is never remeasured after initial recognition.
Derecognition of the convertible bond issued by the Company will be done when the debt is cancelled.
3 Profit and loss account The Company made a loss attributable to equity shareholders of US$18,930,000 2010: gain of US$950,487,000.

15 Financial risk management The Company is exposed to a variety of risks and uncertainties which may have an impact on the achievement of financial and economic objectives.
These risks include strategic, operational and financial risk and are further categorised into risk areas to facilitate risk assessment.
a Foreign currency risk Due to the operations of the Company, it has cash and cash equivalents and trade payables denominated in pound sterling and Canadian dollars.
Accordingly, the financial results of the Company may be affected by exchange rate fluctuations.
The Company does not use derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risks.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of financial assets and liabilities, at the reporting date denominated in their respective currencies, to a reasonably possible change in the US dollar exchange rate, with all other variables held constant, of the Companys profit before tax and the Companys equity.

The Company is primarily exposed to credit risk in transactions in cash which are primarily limited to cash balances deposited in banks and accounts receivable at the statement of financial position date.
The Company evaluated and introduced additional efforts to try to mitigate credit risk exposure.
To manage credit risk associated with cash balances deposited in banks, the Company is using the following options: increasing banking relationships with large, established and well-capitalised institutions in order to secure access to credit and to diversify credit risk: investing cash to the extent possible with counterparties with whom the Company has debt outstanding: investing cash in short-term, highly liquid and low risk instruments money market accounts : maintaining excess cash abroad in hard currency.
Credit risk concentrations exist when changes in economic, industrial or geographic factors take place, affecting in the same manner the Companys counterparties whose added risk exposure is significant to the Companys total credit exposure.
Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Companys exposure to bad debts is not significant.
The maximum exposure is the carrying amount as disclosed in note 6. c Liquidity risk Liquidity risk arises from the Companys inability to obtain the funds it requires to comply with its commitments, including the inability to sell a financial asset quickly enough and at a price close to its fair value.
Management constantly monitors the Companys level of shortand medium-term liquidity and their access to credit lines on reasonable terms in order to ensure appropriate financing is available for its operations.
The Company is funded by Hochschild Mining Holdings Ltd. through loans in order to meet its obligations.
Liquidity is supported by the balance of cash in the Company and Hochschild Mining Holdings at 31 December 2011 of US$1,671,000 and US$526,247,000 respectively.
The Company also serves as principal funding conduit for the Groups capital raising activities such as equity and debt issuances.
The table below analyses the Companys financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period to the contractual maturity date: Less than Between Between Over 1 year 1 and 2 years 2 and 5 years 5 years Total US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 US$000 At 31 December 2011 Trade and other payables 177,648 177,648 Borrowings 6,613 6,613 112,129 125,355 Provisions 97 29 126 At 31 December 2010 Trade and other payables 25,066 223 25,289 Swap contracts 1,938 1,938 Borrowings 35,96163,041146,856 245,858 Provisions 45 45 d Interest rate risk The Company has financial assets which are exposed to interest rate risk.
Changes in interest rates impact primarily loans and borrowings by changing either their fair value fixed rate debt or their future cash flows variable rate debt.
The Company does not have a formal policy of determining how much of its exposure should be at fixed or at variable rates.
However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings management uses its judgement to decide whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate borrowing would be more favourable to the Company over the expected period until maturity.
It is important to note that currently all existing financial obligations are either at fixed rates or have been fixed with the use of derivatives.

Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
The other financial instruments of the Company that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The table below demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in the interest rate, with all other variables held constant, of the financial instruments with a floating rate.
This assumes that the amount remains unchanged from that in place at 31 December 2011 and 2010 and that the change in interest rates is effective from the beginning of the year.
In reality, the floating rate will fluctuate over the year and interest rates will change accordingly: Increase Effect on profit decrease in before tax Year interest rate US$000 2011 50bps 2010 50bps 10 e Capital risk management The Companys objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Companys ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
Management considers as part of its capital, the financial sources of funding from shareholders and third-parties.
In order to ensure an appropriate return for shareholders capital invested in the Company, management monitors capital thoroughly and evaluates all material projects and potential acquisitions before submission to the Board for ultimate approval, where applicable.
