66 financial statements | 4 Segmental information adoption of ifrs 8, operating segments The Group has adopted IFRS 8, Operating Segments, with effect from 1 July 2009.
IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to allocate resources to the segment and to assess their performance.
As a result the Group continues to segment the business into three regions, Asia Pacific, Continental Europe & Rest of World, and United Kingdom & Ireland.
The Groups continuing operations comprise one class of business, that of qualified, professional and skilled recruitment.
net fees and operating profit from continuing operations The Groups Management Board, which is regarded as the chief operating decision maker, uses net fees by segment as its measure of revenue in internal reports.
This is because net fees exclude the remuneration of temporary workers, and payments to other recruitment agencies where the Group acts as principal, which are not considered relevant in allocating resources to segments.
The Groups Management Board considers net fees for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources.
The reconciliation of turnover to net fees can be found in note 6.

There is no material difference between the segmentation of the Groups turnover by geographic origin and destination.
net trade debtors For the purpose of monitoring performance and allocating resources from a balance sheet perspective, the Groups Management Board monitors trade debtors net of provisions for impairments only on a segment by segment basis.

67 Hays plc annual report & financial statements 2011 financial statements | noteS to the ConSolIdAted FInAnCIAl StAtementS CONTINUED 5 exceptional items During the year, the Group recognised an exceptional credit of 4.1 million in relation to the following items: On 1 April 2011, the Competition Appeal Tribunal CAT announced its judgement in respect of Hays appeal against the level of the fine imposed by the Office of Fair Trading OFT in September 2009.
The fine was reduced from 30.4 million to 5.9 million and has been paid in full, bringing this matter to a close.
The effect of the reduction in fine has been recognised in the Income Statement as a non-cash exceptional credit of 24.0 million 2010: non-cash exceptional charge 29.0 million.
As described in note 14 the Group has recognised a non-cash exceptional charge of 10.0 million resulting from the impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in relation to the UK Healthcare business which was acquired in February 2006.
The Group incurred restructuring costs in the UK of 9.9 million comprising redundancy costs of 7.0 million, onerous property leases of 2.1 million and a non-cash fixed asset write-down of 0.8 million.
The exceptional charge generated a tax credit of 2.8 million.
In the prior year the Group incurred an exceptional charge of 41.4 million, comprising 29.0 million in respect of the OFT fine and 12.4 million restructuring costs principally in the UK.
The exceptional charge generated a tax credit of 3.5 million.
The cash impact of the exceptional items during the year was as follows: Cash paid in respect of current year exceptional items was 4.0 million with a further 5.1 million cash outflow expected in the future, primarily in the financial year to 30 June 2012.
Cash paid in respect of prior year exceptional items was 11.4 million, comprising 6.0 million OFT fine including interest, and prior year restructuring costs of 5.4 million.

Goodwill arising on business combinations is reviewed and tested on an annual basis or more frequently if there is indication that goodwill might be impaired.
Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each cash-generating unit CGU, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value-in-use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value-in-use calculations are those regarding operating profit, discount rates and growth rates.
The operating profit is based on the latest one-year forecasts for the CGUs approved by management, and management uses estimated pre-tax discount rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the CGUs.
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts approved by management and extrapolates cash flows in perpetuity based on the long-term growth rates and expected cash conversion rates.
The long-term growth rates are based on management forecasts, which are consistent with external sources of an average estimated growth rate of 3.0% 2010: 3.0%, reflecting long-term wage inflation driving fee growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 12.0% 2010: 12.0%.
Impairment reviews were performed at the year end by comparing the carrying value of goodwill with the recoverable amount of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.
Before impairment testing, the carrying value in respect of the RSG acquisition in the United Kingdom & Ireland group of CGUs was 15.3 million.
Due to current market conditions in the UK Healthcare sector in which the business operates, the Group has revised its cash flow forecasts for this CGU.
The RSG CGU has therefore been reduced to its recoverable amount through the recognition of an impairment loss against goodwill of 10.0 million.
The recoverable amount is considered to be in line with its value-in-use.
Management has determined that there has been no impairment to any of the other CGUs and in respect of these a sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management, and included a change in the discount rate of up to 1% and changes in long term growth rate between 0% and 5%.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario for any of the other CGUs.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: In s million 2011 2010 Asia Pacific 24.5 23.9 Continental Europe & Rest of World 65.9 59.9 United Kingdom & Ireland 93.1 101.8 183.5 185.6 73 Hays plc annual report & financial statements 2011 financial statements | noteS to the ConSolIdAted FInAnCIAl StAtementS CONTINUED 15 other intangible assets In s million 2011 2010 Cost At 1 July 75.0 48.7 Exchange adjustments 0.7 0.1 Additions 11.7 26.2 Disposals 0.3 At 30 June 87.1 75.0 Amortisation At 1 July 12.9 10.1 Exchange adjustments 0.6 Charge for year 10.9 2.8 Disposals 0.2 At 30 June 24.2 12.9 Net book value At 30 June 62.9 62.1 At 1 July 62.1 38.6 All other intangible assets relate to computer software.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so and they relate to taxes levied by the same taxation authority either on the same taxable entity or entities which intend to settle current tax assets or liabilities on a net basis.
At the balance sheet date the Group had unused tax losses of 43.3 million 2010: 33.2 million available for offset against future profits, of which 5.8 million relate to United Kingdom capital losses, 7.8 million relate to otherwise unrelievable EU losses potentially relievable against United Kingdom profits, 21.3 million relate to overseas losses, and 8.4 million relate to United Kingdom losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses 2010: nil.
Of these unrecognised tax losses, 0.1 million is due to expire between 2012 and 2018 and 43.2 million is unlikely to expire in the short term.
The United Kingdom Government has announced that the rate of corporation tax will reduce from 26% to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012.
If this change had been substantively enacted at 30 June 2011, the Groups deferred tax asset would have been reduced by 0.1 million and 0.1 million charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries on which deferred tax liabilities have not been provided is 2.8 million.
The temporary differences at 30 June 2011 represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance of those earnings may still result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the jurisdictions in which those subsidiaries operate.

An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a likely reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The Group reduces risk through its credit control process and by contractual arrangements with other recruitment agencies in situations where the Group invoices on their behalf.
The Groups exposure is spread over a large number of customers.

At 30 June 2011 the Group had drawn down 185.0 million 2010: 145.0 million from its unsecured revolving credit facility.
During the period the Group entered into interest rate derivatives to partially hedge this risk.
The fair value of these derivatives at 30 June was 0.7 million.
The interest rate risk profile of bank loans and overdrafts is as follows: In s million 2011 2010 Floating rate sterling 189.9 151.9 The floating rate liabilities comprise bank loans and unsecured overdrafts bearing interest at rates based on local market rates.
committed facilities On 1 July 2010 the Group renewed its unsecured revolving credit facility and in the process reduced the facility from 460 million to 300 million.
The new facility expires in January 2014.
The financial covenants under the facility require the Groups interest cover to be at least 4:1 and its leverage ratio net debt to EBITDA to be no greater than 2.5:1.
The interest rate of the facility is based on a ratchet mechanism with a margin payable over LIBOR in the range of 1.75% to 2.25%.
At 30 June 2011, 115.0 million of the committed facility was undrawn.

capital management The Boards current priorities for the Groups free cash flow are to fund Group development, maintain the strength of the Balance Sheet and to support a sustainable dividend policy.
The Groups overall strategy remains unchanged from last year in that it manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns through the economic cycle.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, which is represented by cash and cash equivalents note 19, bank loans and overdrafts note 20 and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued share capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 24 to 28.
The Group is not restricted to any externally imposed capital requirements.
foreign currency risk The Group did not have a material income statement exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2011.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.

22 retirement benefit obligations Within the UK the Group operates one defined contribution scheme and two defined benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either defined contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
a uK defined contribution scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benefits are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 18% of pensionable salary depending on the level of employee contribution and seniority.
The total cost charged to the Consolidated Income Statement of 3.0 million 2010: 2.3 million represents employers contributions payable to the Stakeholder Pension Plan.
Contributions of 0.3 million 2010: 0.2 million were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Stakeholder Pension Plan are held separately from those of the Group.
b uK defined Benefit schemes i The Hays Pension Scheme is a defined benefit scheme where the benefits are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved defined benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001.
An RPI cap on pensionable pay was implemented in 2007 in respect of active members.
The Scheme is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded unapproved retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme is carried out every three years.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme was performed at 30 June 2009.
Following this valuation, the deficit was 150 million and a revised deficit funding schedule of 12 million per annum, subject to a 3% per annum fixed uplift over a 12-year period, was agreed with effect from 1 July 2010.
During the year the Group made a contribution of 12 million to the Hays Pension Scheme 2010: 1.2 million in accordance with the agreed deficit funding schedule.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuation of the Hays Pension Scheme to 30 June 2011 and a valuation of the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme have been performed by an independent actuary, and employee of Hymans Robertson LLP.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2011 are listed below.
ias 19 accounting valuation Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected-unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high-quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside the Consolidated Income Statement, in retained earnings and presented in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
The principal long-term assumptions are as follows: % 2011 2010 RPI inflation 3.6 3.4 CPI inflation 2.9 n a Discount rate 5.5 5.4 Rate of increase in salaries 3.9 3.6 Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 3.6 3.4 Expected long-term rate of return on scheme assets 6.1 6.0 79 Hays plc annual report & financial statements 2011 financial statements | noteS to the ConSolIdAted FInAnCIAl StAtementS CONTINUED 22 retirement benefit obligations continued The assumption for the expected long-term rate of return for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions of each asset class held at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net financial charge.
The mortality rates have been calculated using the S1NA generational mortality tables with a medium cohort projection and an underpin to future improvements of 1% per annum with age adjustments minus 0.5 years for male pensioners.
This assumes that a 65-year-old male current pensioner has a life expectancy of 21.5 years.
The amounts recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement for the defined benefit schemes are as follows: In s million 2011 2010 Expected return on pension scheme assets 22.7 21.0 Interest on pension liabilities 23.9 27.7 Net financial charge 1.2 6.7 Current service cost 3.8 4.1 Total amount charged to the Consolidated Income Statement 5.0 10.8 The actuarial gains and losses have been recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as follows: In s million 2011 2010 Actuarial gain on scheme assets 36.8 37.2 Actuarial loss gain due to scheme experience 0.5 52.2 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 7.4 42.0 Net gain recognised directly in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 43.7 47.4 In s million 2011 2010 Deficit in the scheme brought forward 67.1 109.2 Current service cost 3.8 4.1 Contributions 16.5 5.5 Net financial return 1.2 6.7 Actuarial gain 43.7 47.4 Deficit in the scheme carried forward 11.9 67.1 The amount included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet arising from the Groups obligations in respect of its defined benefit pension schemes is as follows: In s million 2011 2010 Present value of defined benefit obligations 452.4 445.3 Fair value of scheme assets 440.5 378.2 Defined benefit scheme deficit 11.9 67.1 Liability recognised in the Consolidated Balance Sheet 11.9 67.1 80 financial statements | Changes in the present value of defined benefit obligations are as follows: In s million 2011 2010 Change in benefit obligation Benefit obligation at 1 July 445.3 439.1 Current service cost 3.8 4.1 Interest cost 23.9 27.7 Members contributions 0.4 0.6 Actuarial loss gain due to scheme experience 0.5 52.2 Changes in assumptions 7.4 42.0 Benefits and expenses paid 14.1 16.0 Benefit obligation at 30 June 452.4 445.3 Analysis of defined benefit obligation Plans that are wholly or partly funded 444.7 437.8 Plans that are wholly unfunded 7.7 7.5 Total 452.4 445.3 Change in the fair value of scheme assets Fair value of plan assets at 1 July 378.2 329.9 Expected return on plan assets 22.7 21.0 Actuarial gain 36.8 37.2 Employer contributions 16.5 5.5 Member contributions 0.4 0.6 Benefits and expenses paid 14.1 16.0 Fair value of plan assets at 30 June 440.5 378.2 The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to higher than expected asset returns and the increase in employer contributions.
The actuarial gain due to changes in assumptions comprises a gain on account of deferred revaluation becoming linked to CPI rather than RPI in line with the statutory change for this benefit, offset by a loss due to the decrease in the net yield discount rate versus RPI inflation rate.
The analysis of the scheme assets and the expected return at the Consolidated Balance Sheet date was as follows: 2011 2010 2011 expected 2010 Expected Fair value return Fair value return s million % s million % Equities 224.7 7.3% 196.7 7.3% Bonds and gilts 198.2 4.9% 166.4 4.9% Other 17.6 0.5% 15.1 0.5% 440.5 6.1% 378.2 6.0% To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption used in determining the net pension cost for the year to 30 June 2011, the Group considered the level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the rate of return on AA rated corporate bonds, the level of risk premium associated with the other assets classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each assets class at 30 June 2010.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on asset assumption for the portfolio.
This resulted in the selection of the 6.0% assumption for the year ended 30 June 2011.

Performance share Plan PsP and deferred annual Bonus daB The PSP is designed to link reward to the key long-term value drivers of the business and to align the interests of the executive directors and approximately 360 of the global senior management population with the long-term interests of shareholders.
PSP awards are discretionary and vesting is dependent upon the achievement of performance conditions measured over either a three-year period or a one-year period with a two-year holding period.
Only the executive directors and other members of the Management Board participate in the DAB which promotes a stronger link between short-term and long-term performance through the deferral of annual bonuses into shares for a three-year period.
Further details of the schemes for the executive directors can be found in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 57.
