The Group tests indefinite life brands annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that they might be impaired.

The conclusion of this impairment review was that the Groups David Wilson Homes brand was not impaired.
The brand of Wilson Bowden Developments valued at 7.0m prior to amortisation was being amortised over ten years as it is a business-tobusiness brand operating in niche markets.
Following an impairment review at 30 June 2008, the Wilson Bowden Developments brand was fully impaired.
