DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 6.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The Company uses derivative financial instruments in the form of forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the effects of its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates on its borrowings.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument and, if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign currency contracts is calculated using quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
6.2 ANALYSIS OF DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Derivative financial instruments comprise forward foreign exchange contracts, where changes in fair value are recognised in the profit and loss account, and interest rate swaps, where changes in fair value are initially recognised in reserves.
The fair values of the Companys derivative financial instruments as at 31 December 2011 comprised an asset of 0.8m 2010: nil, which is recognised within current assets, and a liability of 16.5m 2010: 30.8m, recognised within current liabilities 2010: 16.7m recognised within current liabilities, and 14.1m recognised within non-current liabilities.

RESERVES 10.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY a Taxation Both current and deferred tax are calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Current tax payable is based on the taxable result for the year.
Deferred taxation is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
b Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than the Companys functional currency foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each subsequent balance sheet date foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
All exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 12.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to each plan for the year.

The assets of the Companys closed UK-wide defined benefits pension plan the UK Plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the UK Plan on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, accounts for the UK Plan as if it were a defined contribution scheme.

SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 13.1 ACCOUNTING POLICY The Company principally operates equity-settled share-based payment arrangements for its employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date takes account of the effect of market-based conditions, such as the Total Shareholder Return target upon which vesting for some of the awards is conditional, and is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period with a corresponding increase in equity.
The cumulative expense recognised is adjusted for the best estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and for the effect of other non market-based vesting conditions, such as growth in headline earnings per share, which are not included in the fair value determined at the date of grant.
For grants with market-based conditions attaching to them, fair value is measured using a form of stochastic option pricing model.
For all other grants, fair value is measured using the BlackScholes model.
13.2 PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT RECOGNITION The Company operates a number of different share-based payment schemes, the main features of which are detailed on pages 42 to 45 of the Directors Remuneration Report.
The total expense recognised in respect of share-based payments in the year was 2.9m 2010: 3.5m, of which 2.8m 2010: 3.5m related to the Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.

CONTINGENT LIABILITIES Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and accounts for them as such.
In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
Guarantees provided by the Company as at 31 December 2011 in respect of the liabilities of its subsidiary companies amounted to 30.7m 2010: 40.8m, which includes guarantees under property leases of operations disposed of amounting to 4.1m 2010: 4.1m.
In addition, on behalf of its subsidiaries the Company has given guarantees to precious metals consignors amounting to 362.8m 2010: 354.8m, representing all of the value of precious metals held by its subsidiaries on consignment terms as at 31 December 2011.
Further details of these consignment arrangements are given in note 20 to the consolidated financial statements.
Cookson has extensive international operations and is subject to various legal and regulatory regimes, including those covering taxation and environmental matters.
Several of the Companys subsidiaries are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the company involved, and are aware of a number of issues which are, or may be, the subject of dispute with tax authorities.
While the outcome of litigation and other disputes can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the insurance arrangements of the Company and its subsidiaries, the Directors believe that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a materially adverse effect on the Companys financial condition or results of operations.
RELATED PARTIES All transactions with related parties are conducted on an arms length basis and in accordance with normal business terms.
Transactions between related parties that are wholly owned Group subsidiaries are not disclosed in this note.
