In addition, the Board was satisfied that both Jonathan Dawson and Christine Cross, who were first appointed to the Board 7 years and 6 years ago respectively, remain independent in both character and judgement, and their knowledge and other business interests continue to enable them to contribute significantly to the work and balance of the Board.

Disclosure of information to auditors In accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that: n so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Companys auditors are unaware: and n each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Companys auditors are aware of that information.
Authority to allot shares Ordinary resolution 14 will, if passed, renew the directors authority pursuant to sections 550 to 573 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, shares until the conclusion of the AGM in 2012 or, if earlier, 1 August 2012.
This resolution will allow the directors to allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 5,994,000 representing approximately one third 33.33% of the Companys existing issued share capital as at 22 March 2011.
In accordance with the latest institutional guidelines, resolution 14 will also allow directors to allot further ordinary shares, in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue, of up to a maximum nominal amount of 11,988,000, representing approximately two thirds 66.67% of the Companys existing issued share capital.
As at 22 March 2011 being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document the Companys issued share capital amounted to 17,982,139, comprising 179,821,387 ordinary shares of 10 pence each, none of which are held in treasury.
The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority.
Authority to disapply pre-emption rights Special resolution 15 will, if passed, renew the directors authority pursuant to Section 560 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot equity securities for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings.
This resolution limits the aggregate nominal value of ordinary shares which may be issued by the directors on a non pre-emptive basis to 899,000, being less than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 22 March 2011.
This authority also allows the directors, within the same aggregate limit, to sell for cash shares that may be held by the Company in treasury.
The directors do not have any present intention of exercising this authority which will expire at the AGM in 2012 or, if earlier, 1 August 2012.

indd 19 11 04 2011 11:02:33 Business reports Directors Report and Business Review 20 On-market purchase of own shares NEXT has been returning capital to its shareholders by share repurchases as well as dividend since March 2000 as part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share.
Over this period, and up to 22 March 2011, NEXT has returned over 2.3bn to shareholders by way of share buybacks and almost 1.1bn in dividends.
This buyback activity has enhanced earnings per share, given shareholders the opportunity for capital as well as revenue returns and has been transparent to the financial markets.
Share buybacks have not been made at the expense of investment in the business.
Over the last five years, NEXT has invested almost 700m in capital expenditure to support and grow the business.
Special resolution 16 will renew the authority for the Company to make market purchases as defined in Section 693 of the Companies Act 2006 of its ordinary shares of 10p each provided that: a the aggregate number of ordinary shares authorised to be purchased shall be the lesser of 26,970,000 ordinary shares of 10p each being 15% of the issued share capital at 22 March 2011 and no more than 15% of the issued ordinary share capital outstanding at the date of the AGM, such limits to be reduced by the number of any shares to be purchased pursuant to special resolution 17: Off-market purchases of own shares, see below: b the payment per ordinary share is not less than 10p and not more than 105% of the average of the middle market price of the ordinary shares according to the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the date of purchase: and c the renewed authority expires on whichever is the earlier of the next AGM of the Company in 2012 and 1 August 2012.
The directors intend that this authority to purchase the Companys shares will only be exercised if doing so will result in an increase in earnings per share and, being in the interests of shareholders generally, it is considered to promote the success of the Company.
The directors will also give careful consideration to financial gearing levels of the Company and its general financial position.
The purchase price would be paid out of distributable profits.
It is the directors present intention to cancel any shares purchased under this authority.
The repurchase of ordinary shares would give rise to a stamp duty liability at the rate of 0.5% of the consideration paid by the Company, rounded up to the nearest 5.
The liability will be a liability of the Company.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 22 March 2011 was 12,731,620.
This represents 7.1% of the issued share capital at that date.
If the Company were to buy back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to this resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 22 March 2011 would represent 8.3% of the reduced issued share capital.
Off-market purchases of own shares The directors consider that share buybacks are an important means of returning value to shareholders and maximising sustainable long term growth in EPS.
Contingent contracts for off-market share purchases are an integral part of the Companys buyback strategy and offer a number of additional benefits compared to on-market share purchases: n Contingent contracts allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price prevailing at the date each contract is entered into.
Due to the uncertain economic environment, the directors did not consider it appropriate to use the authorities granted at the 2008, 2009 and 2010 AGMs.
Previously, in December 2007 and January 2008 the Company bought back shares for cancellation under such contracts at a discount of up to 11.75% compared with market prices prevailing when the relevant contract commenced.
n Low share liquidity often prevents the Company from purchasing a large number of shares on a single day without affecting the prevailing market price.
Contingent contracts enable the Company to purchase blocks of shares over a period of time without distorting the prevailing share price.
This purchase method is also cash flow advantageous insofar as it defers the cash outflow of any related buybacks.
n Contingent contracts enhance flexibility in the Companys buyback activity when trading volumes are low or the Company would otherwise be restricted from buying on-market, e. g. during close periods.
The Company has previously entered into irrevocable and non-discretionary programmes to allow it to buy shares during close periods.
By entering into contingent contracts prior to any close period, the Company is also allowed to purchase shares off-market during these periods.
Clearance from the FSA for use of contingent contracts, including for settlement in close periods, has been obtained.
n Competitive tendering involving up to four banks is used which minimises the risk of hidden purchase costs.
The tender pricing mechanism ensures that the Company retains the benefit of forecast dividends, as well as any dividends declared, on share purchase commitments covered by contingent contracts.

indd 20 11 04 2011 11:02:33 Directors Report and Business Review 21 As with any on-market share buyback decision, the directors would use this authority only after careful consideration, taking into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate financial gearing levels and the overall financial position of the Company.
The directors will only purchase shares using such contracts if, based on the contract discounted price rather than any subsequent changes to the share price that cannot be predicted, it is earnings enhancing and promotes the success of the Company for the benefit of its shareholders generally.
Special resolution 17 will give the Company authority to enter into further contingent purchase contracts with each of Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Bank plc under which shares may be purchased off-market at a discount to the market price prevailing at the date each contract is entered into.
The total number of shares which the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would be 9,000,000 and would not exceed a total cost of 200m.
The principal features of the contracts are set out in Appendix 1 to the Notice of the AGM.
Copies of each contract will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company, and at the offices of Allen & Overy LLP, One Bishops Square, London, E1 6AD during normal working hours from the date of the Notice of the AGM up to the date of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
Notice of General Meetings The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days.
The Companys AGM must always be held on at least 21 clear days notice.
At the AGM of the Company held in 2010, shareholders authorised the calling of general meetings other than an AGM on not less than 14 clear days notice and it is proposed that this authority be renewed.
The authority granted by special resolution 18, if passed, will be effective until the Companys AGM in 2012, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
In order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days notice, the Company will make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.
The flexibility offered by this resolution will only be used where the directors consider it appropriate, taking account of the business to be considered at the meeting and the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation Your directors are of the opinion that all resolutions which are to be proposed at the 2011 AGM will promote the success of the Company and are in the best interests of its shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, unanimously recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions.
