indd 88 11 04 2011 11:03:02 Notice of Meeting 89 APPENDIX 1 FURTHER INFORMATION ON RESOLUTION 17: OFF MARKET PURCHASES OF OWN SHARES As noted on pages 20 and 21 in the Directors Report and Business Review, approval will be sought from shareholders to renew the Companys authority to make off-market purchases of its shares.
By virtue of special resolution number 10 passed at the Companys Annual General Meeting AGM on 18 May 2010 shareholder authority was given to the Company to make on-market purchases of shares for cancellation.
This authority was limited to a maximum of 28.1m shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM held in 2011 or 1 August 2011.
At the same AGM, authority was granted to the Company to make off-market purchases of shares for cancellation under contingent purchase contracts to be entered into with each of Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays Bank plc the Bank s. This authority was limited to a maximum of 9.5m shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM to be held in 2011 or 1 August 2011.
Since the granting of those authorities up to 22 March 2011, the Company has bought back 4,718,409 shares for cancellation, representing 2.6% of its issued share capital as at the date of the 2010 AGM, at a total cost of 96.9m.
No shares have been bought back under contingent purchase contracts.
Under Sections 693 and 694 of the Companies Act 2006 the Act, the Company is not permitted to make off-market purchases or contingent purchases of its shares unless it obtains advance shareholder approval to the proposed contract terms.
Furthermore, under the rules of the UK Listing Authority the Listing Rules the Company may not purchase its shares at a time when any director is in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information about the Company.
Accordingly, no purchases of shares would normally be made in periods when the directors might be in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information Close Periods.
Typically, these include the periods from the Companys half year end up to the announcement of its interim results in September and the January year end up to the announcement of full year results in March each year.
These Close Periods inevitably reduce the number of shares the Company is able to purchase.
In order to achieve maximum flexibility in its share purchase activities, the Company is able to enter into irrevocable and nondiscretionary programmes to allow it to buy shares during Close Periods.
Another method of providing flexibility in its share purchase activities, and reducing the cost of share buybacks, is for the Company to enter into contingent forward purchase contracts outside of Close Periods.
Pursuant to the authority granted at the 2010 AGM, the Company entered into agreements with the Banks the Existing Agreements and the Company intends to terminate the Existing Agreements and enter into new agreements.
The Company proposes to enter into an agreement with each of the Banks the Programme Agreements, under which it may although it is not obliged to enter into contingent forward trades Contingent Forward Trades or CFT from time to time.
Under the terms of each CFT, the Company may purchase a fixed number of shares each week over a period of between 20 to 30 weeks.
The maximum number of shares that can be purchased under each CFT is limited to 50,000 shares per week.
Details of each CFT will be announced to shareholders on the day it is entered into by the Company.
Whether or not the Company purchases shares in a particular week during the term of a CFT is dependent upon the Companys share price not reaching a level set at the time that contract is entered into the Suspension Level.
The Suspension Level is determined by the Company and must be between 104% and 110% of the Companys share price as at the start of the CFT.
The price at which the Company may purchase shares during the term of a Contingent Forward Trade the Forward Price shall also be fixed at the start of the CFT.
The Forward Price is subject to a maximum of 99% of the share price at the start of the contract and a minimum of 10 pence the par value of an ordinary share.
This structure would allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price as at the time each CFT commences, for so long as the Suspension Level is not reached, without breaching the Listing Rules.
If the Suspension Level is reached, the CFT would terminate automatically at that time and no further shares would be purchased under that contract.
In such circumstances, a reduced number of shares would be purchased by the Company for cancellation under that contract.
Under the provisions of sections 693 and 694 of the Act, the Programme Agreements and Contingent Forward Trades are contingent purchase contracts to purchase shares by the Company off-market.
Accordingly resolution 17, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks shareholder approval to the terms of the Programme Agreements to be entered into between the Company and each of the Banks.
The Programme Agreements will have a duration of the shorter of the period to the date of the next AGM to be held in 2012 or 1 August 2012 and will incorporate the terms of an ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule.
The Programme Agreements will be entered into and each CFT will be effected outside a Close Period but shares may be purchased during a Close Period by the Company.
The minimum and maximum amount of time between a CFT being effected and shares being purchased is 5 days and 30 weeks respectively.
indd 89 11 04 2011 11:03:02 Additional information Notice of Meeting 90 Should shareholder approval be granted, any number of CFT may be effected with the Banks at any time, provided that: n the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would be 9.0m, representing less than 5.0% of its issued share capital at 29 January 2011: n the total cost of shares that the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority may not exceed 200m including costs : n the Forward Price may not exceed 105% of the average middle market closing price of the Companys shares as derived from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five days immediately preceding the day on which the Contingent Forward Trade was effected: n the Forward Price will be no more than 99% of the share price at the time the Contingent Forward Trade was effected: n the minimum price that can be paid for any share is 0.10: and n only one Contingent Forward Trade will be entered into on any particular day.
Subject to the limits set out above, the Company will select the Suspension Level and the duration of each CFT, and the Forward Price will be determined by the relevant Bank.
Shares purchased via the Programme Agreements will reduce the number of shares that the Company may purchase under any authority granted at the AGM on 19 May 2011 for on-market purchases.
No shares will be purchased under that authority on the same day that a CFT is entered into.
The authority granted to the Company under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2012 or on 1 August 2012, whichever is the earlier, unless such authority is renewed prior to that time except in relation to the purchase of shares under any CFT effected before the expiry of such authority and which might be completed wholly or partly after such expiry.
The purchase of shares under the Programme Agreements will always be physically settled by delivery of shares to the Company except in the case of certain events of default or termination events.
A copy of each of the Programme Agreements will be available at the AGM on 19 May 2012.
Copies will also be available for inspection at the Companys registered office at Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester LE19 4AT or at the offices of Allen & Overy LLP, One Bishops Square, London, E1 6AD during usual business hours until the date of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 22 March 2011 was 12,731,620.
This represents 7.1% of the issued share capital at that date.
If the Company were to buy back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to this special resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 22 March 2011 would represent 7.5% of the reduced issued share capital.

A proxy need not also be a member.
A proxy may vote on any other business which may properly come before the meeting.
If you do not intend being present at the meeting please either sign and return a hard copy form of proxy so as to reach the Companys registrars at least 48 hours before the meeting or follow the instructions for electronic proxy appointment through CREST or through www.

The statements of the rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in the above paragraph and in the paragraphs headed Electronic proxy appointment through CREST and Proxy card below do not apply to a Nominated Person.
The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by registered members of the Company.
Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder of their shares and not the Company on matters relating to their investments in the Company.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and its articles of association, specifies that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 6pm on 17 May 2011 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the aforesaid general meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their name at that time.
Changes to entries on the relevant register of securities after 6 p. m. on 17 May 2011 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.

This means that the votes of all shareholders, including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly appoint a proxy, are counted.
The procedures for the poll votes will be explained at the AGM.

Therefore, NEXT intends to disregard any poll votes which are cast in favour of resolution 17 attaching to 9.0 million shares being the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to the Programme Agreements from both the total number of votes cast in favour of this resolution and the total number of votes cast.
As at 22 March 2011 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice the Companys issued share capital consists of 179,821,387 ordinary shares.
All of the ordinary shares carry one vote each and there are no shares held in treasury.
A member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions.
The Company must ensure any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting is answered but no such answer need be given if a to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, b the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or c it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
