With effect from 1 April 2011 the UK statutory corporation tax rate reduced from 28% to 26%.
For 2010, the items presented in the reconciliation are distorted as a result of the overall tax credit for the year and the loss before taxation.
In order to provide a more meaningful analysis of the effective tax rate for 2010, the table also presents separate reconciliations for the group excluding the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, and for the impacts of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in isolation.
For 2011, the effective tax rate is not impacted signicantly by the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

At 31 December 2011, the group had approximately $4.6 billion 2010 $3.9 billion of carry-forward tax losses that would be available to offset against future taxable profit.
A deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $3.8 billion of losses 2010 $3.0 billion.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $0.8 billion of losses 2010 $0.9 billion.
In 2011, a current tax benefit of $0.1 billion arose relating to losses utilized on which a deferred tax asset had not previously been recognized 2010 nil.
Substantially all the tax losses have no xed expiry date.
At 31 December 2011, the group had approximately $18.2 billion of unused tax credits predominantly in the UK and US 2010 $13.9 billion.
At 31 December 2011 there is a deferred tax asset of $2.5 billion in respect of unused tax credits 2010 $2.1 billion.
No deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of $15.7 billion of tax credits 2010 $11.8 billion.
In 2011, a current tax benefit of $0.1 billion arose relating to tax credits utilized on which a deferred tax asset had not previously been recognized 2010 $0.3 billion.
The UK tax credits, arising in UK branches overseas with no deferred tax asset, amounting to $13.0 billion 2010 $9.9 billion do not have a xed expiry date.
In addition there are also temporary differences in overseas branches of UK companies with no deferred tax asset recognized.
At 31 December 2011 the unrecognized deferred tax amounted to $0.9 billion 2010 $0.9 billion.
These credits and temporary differences arise in UK branches predominantly based in high tax rate jurisdictions and so are unlikely to have value in the future as UK taxes on these overseas branches are largely mitigated by the double tax relief on the local foreign tax.
The US tax credits with no deferred tax asset amounting to $2.7 billion 2010 $1.9 billion expire 10 years after generation, and the majority expire in the period 2014-2021.
The group recognized significant costs in 2010 in relation to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill and in 2011 has recognized certain recoveries relating to the incident as well as further costs.
Tax has been calculated on the expenditures that are expected to qualify for tax relief, and on the recoveries, at the US statutory tax rate.
A deferred tax asset has been recognized in respect of provisions for future expenditure that are expected to qualify for tax relief.
This is included under the heading decommissioning, environmental and other provisions.
The other major components of temporary differences at the end of 2011 relate to tax depreciation, provisions, including items relating to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, US inventory holding gains classied as other taxable temporary differences and pension plan and other post-retirement benefit plan deficits.
At 31 December 2011, there were no material temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized.
In 2011, the enactment of a 12% increase in the UK supplementary charge on oil and gas production activities in the North Sea increased the deferred tax charge in the income statement by $713 million of which $683 million relates to the revaluation of the opening deferred tax balance.
Also in 2011, the enactment of a 2% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 25% with effect from 1 April 2012 on profits arising from activities outside the North Sea reduced the deferred tax charge in the income statement by $120 million.
In 2010 the enactment of a 1% reduction in the rate of UK corporation tax to 27% with effect from 1 April 2011 similarly reduced the deferred tax charge in the income statement by $86 million.
In 2012, legislation to restrict relief for UK decommissioning expenditure from 62% to 50% is expected to be enacted.
New legislation is also likely to be introduced in Australia which would bring BPs North West Shelf activities into the charge to Petroleum Resource Rent Tax PRRT from July 2012.
The impacts of both of these changes are currently being assessed.
