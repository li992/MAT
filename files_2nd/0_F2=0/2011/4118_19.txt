d Merger reserve Where shares have been issued as consideration for acquisitions, the value of shares issued in excess of nominal value has been credited to the merger reserve rather than to the share premium account.

Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2011 59 Notes to the accounts 1.
Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs The Group and Company financial statements of Cranswick plc the Company for the year ended 31 March 2011 were authorised for issue by the Board of Directors on 16 May 2011 and the balance sheets were signed on the Boards behalf by M Davey and JM Bottomley.
Cranswick plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
The Groups financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the Group and by the Company are set out in note 2.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of Cranswick plc, both consolidated and Company, have been prepared under IFRS as adopted by the European Union and in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been consistently applied throughout the year and the preceding year, is as follows: Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Cranswick plc and its subsidiaries.
The results of undertakings acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities as at the balance sheet date and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the year.
However, the nature of estimation means that actual outcomes could differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Groups accounting policies, management has made the following judgements, apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements: Share-based payments Note 25 measurement of share-based payments Goodwill Note 12 measurement of the recoverable amount of cash generating units containing goodwill Provisions Note 22 judgements in relation to amounts provided Pensions Note 26 Pension scheme actuarial assumptions Acquisitions Note 15 and 16 fair values on acquisition and investment in associates Put option Note 19 and 23 valuation of put option in relation to associate Interest in associate The Groups investment in its associate is accounted for using the equity method, initially recognised at fair value.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence.
Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the Group balance sheet at deemed cost being its fair value on initial recognition plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate.
Under the equity method, the investment in an associate is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less distributions received and less any impairment in value of individual investments.
Any goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associate is included within the carrying amount of the associate and is neither amortised nor tested for impairment.
60 Report & Accounts 2011 Cranswick plc The share of profit or loss of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement.
This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax.
Where there has been a change recognised directly in the equity of the associate, the Group recognises its share of any changes and discloses this, when applicable, in the Group Statement of Changes in Equity.
Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the associate.
The financial statements of the associate were prepared for the period to 30 January 2011 and have been updated to 31 March 2011 with reference to management accounts.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group.
Foreign currencies In the accounts of each entity in the Group, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into functional currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Profits and losses on settlement of individual foreign currency transactions and movements on monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the income statement.
Revenue Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue, and any associated costs can be measured reliably.
Revenue on the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the buyer on despatch and represents the value of sales to customers net of discounts, similar allowances and estimates of returns and excludes value added tax.
Intangible assets Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business over the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment is determined by assessing the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised.
When an entity is disposed of, any goodwill associated with it is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal except that goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 2004 which was previously deducted from equity is not recycled through the income statement.
There have been no business combinations giving rise to goodwill or other intangible assets subsequent to 1 April 2010.
Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised at fair value separately from goodwill only if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and the future economic benefits are expected to flow to the Group.
Taxation Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax base of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences: i except where the deferred income tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carry-forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised: Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2011 61 i except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or a liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss: and ii in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income taxes relating to items recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity and not in the income statement.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on property, plant and equipment on the depreciable amount, being cost less the estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual parts.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Short leasehold improvements Residue of lease Plant and equipment 5 - 11 years Motor vehicles 4 years The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment individually or at the cash generating unit level when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Capitalised borrowing costs Borrowing costs incurred in financing the construction of qualifying assets such as property, plant and equipment are capitalised up to the date at which the relevant asset is substantially complete.
Borrowing costs are calculated using the Groups weighted average cost of borrowing during the period of capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are expensed as incurred.
Accounting for leases i Finance leases Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised at the inception of the lease at fair value or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments, in Property, plant and equipment and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in Borrowings.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the term of the lease.
The interest element of the rental obligations is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remainder of the capital amount outstanding.
ii Operating leases Leases, which are not finance leases, are classified as operating leases.
Lease payments are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
62 Report & Accounts 2011 Cranswick plc Government grants and contributions UK Regional Development Grants and grants receivable from the European Union and DEFRA in respect of property, plant and equipment are credited to deferred income and released to the income statement over the relevant depreciation period.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis and net realisable value after making allowance for any obsolete or slow-moving items.
In the case of finished goods, cost comprises direct materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of manufacturing fixed and variable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash equivalents are defined as cash at bank and in hand including short term deposits with original maturity within 3 months.
For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Financial instruments i Debt instruments, including bank borrowings Debt instruments are initially recognised at the fair value of net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs.
Subsequently debt instruments are recognised at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Issue costs are charged to the income statement over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount under the effective interest method.
ii Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its cash flow risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with a similar maturity profile.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market values for similar instruments.
Where derivatives meet the hedging criteria under IAS 39 for cash flow hedges the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
Gains or losses recognised in comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the net profit or loss.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken directly to net profit or loss for the period.
Financial assets loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market, do not qualify as trading assets and have not been designated as either fair value through profit and loss or available-for-sale.
Such assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method if the time value of money is significant.
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Employee benefits i Pensions A subsidiary of the Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme for certain employees which requires contributions to be made to a separate trustee administered fund.
The scheme was closed to new members on 30 June 2004.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of the defined benefit pension scheme is the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-service costs.
The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outflows using interest rates of high quality corporate Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2011 63 bonds that are denominated in sterling, and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
The amounts charged to operating profit are any gains and losses on settlements and curtailments, and these are included as part of staff costs.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless the changes to the pension scheme are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time the vesting period.
In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.
The difference between the interest cost on plan liabilities and the expected return on plan assets is recognised in the income statement as other finance revenue or costs.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to the statement of comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes for employees under which contributions are paid into schemes managed by major insurance companies.
Contributions are calculated as a percentage of employees earnings and obligations for contributions to the schemes are recognised as cost of sales or operating expenses in the income statement in the period in which they arise.
ii Equity settled share-based payments The Group operates a savings related share option scheme under which options have been granted to Group employees SAYE scheme.
In addition, the Group operates an Executive share option scheme and a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for senior Executives.
Share options awarded are exercisable subject to the attainment of certain market based and non-market based performance criteria.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date on which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any service and performance vesting conditions, other than performance conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
Any other conditions which are required to be met in order for an employee to become fully entitled to an award are considered to be non-vesting conditions.
Like market performance conditions, non-vesting conditions are taken into account in determining the grant date fair value.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market or nonvesting condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance or service conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated: representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period.
In addition, an expense is recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification.
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled including when a non-vesting condition within the control of the entity or employee is not met, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately.
Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
64 Report & Accounts 2011 Cranswick plc On transition to IFRS, the Group did not apply the measurement rules of IFRS 2 to equity settled awards granted before 7 November 2002 or granted after that date and vested before 1 January 2005.
However later modifications of such equity instruments are measured under IFRS 2.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are material items which derive from events or transactions that fall within the ordinary activities of the reporting entity and which individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence if the financial statements are to give a true and fair view.
Dividends Dividends receivable by the Company are recognised in the income statement if they are declared, appropriately authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity paying the dividend, prior to the balance sheet date.
Dividends payable by the Company are recognised when declared and therefore final dividends proposed after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
Dividends paid to Shareholders are shown as a movement in equity rather than on the face of the income statement.
Investments Investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less any provision for impairment.
New standards and interpretations applied The following accounting standards and interpretations became effective for the current reporting period: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions Amendment 1 January 2010 IFRS 3 Business Combinations Revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements Revised January 2008 1 July 2009 IAS 32 Classification of Rights Issues Amendment 1 February 2010 IAS 39 Eligible Hedged Items 1 July 2009 Improvements to International Financial Reporting Standards April 2009 Various International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 17 Distributions of Non-Cash Assets to Owners 1 July 2009 The application of IFRS 2 Group Cash-settled Share-based Payment Transactions Amendment has resulted in the Company recognising in its own balance sheet, share based payments awarded to employees of subsidiaries that are settled in the Companys own shares.
The financial effect of awards by the Company of options over its equity shares to employees of subsidiary undertakings is recognised by the Company in its own financial statements as an increase in its investment in subsidiaries with a credit to equity equivalent to the IFRS 2 charge recognised by subsidiary undertakings.
This treatment has been applied for the first time in these financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2011.
Comparative information has been restated so that it is also in conformity with the revised standard.
This has resulted in the net assets of the Company for the year ended 31 March 2010 being restated from 76,676,000 to 79,487,000.
There was no impact on the Group balance sheet.
The application of the other standards and interpretations has not had a material effect on the net assets, results and disclosures of the Group.
New standards and interpretations not applied The IASB and IFRIC have issued a number of new standards and interpretations with an effective date after the date of these financial statements.
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups and Companys financial statements in the period of initial application.
The standards not applied are as follows: Cranswick plc Report & Accounts 2011 65 International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs Effective date IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures Amendment 1 July 2011 IFRS 9 Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement 1 January 2013 IAS 12 Income Taxes Amendment Deferred Taxes: Recovery of underlying assets 1 January 2012 IAS 24 revised Related Party Disclosures 1 January 2011 Improvements to IFRS issued May 2010 Various dates International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 14 Prepayments of a Minimum Funding Requirement Amendment 1 January 2011 IFRIC 19 Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments 1 July 2010 The effective dates stated above are those given in the original IASB IFRIC standards and interpretations.
As the Group prepares its financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, the application of new standards and interpretations will be subject to their having been endorsed for use in the EU via the EU Endorsement mechanism.
In the majority of cases this will result in an effective date consistent with that given in the original standard or interpretation but the need for endorsement restricts the Groups discretion to early adopt standards.
The Group has not early adopted any of the above standards.
3. Business and geographical segments IFRS 8 requires operating segments to be identified on the basis of the internal financial information reported to the Chief Operating Decision Maker CODM.
The Groups CODM is deemed to be the Board, which is primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance of the segments.
The CODM assesses profit performance using profit before taxation measured on a basis consistent with the disclosure in the Group accounts.
The Group continues to report on two reportable segments: Food Manufacture and supply of food products to UK grocery retailers, the food service sector and other food producers.
Pet Sales into the pet and aquatic sector through the supply of bird and small animal food, marine fish and aquatic products.
This segment was discontinued during the year ended 31 March 2009.
All Group revenues are received for the provision of goods: no revenues are received in relation to the provision of services.
The Food segment includes the operating profits of the Groups associate.
The revenue and profit of the Pet segment for 2010 reflected its trading for the period prior to sale.
There was no inter-segment turnover in either year.
Subsequent to the sale of the Pet business all assets and liabilities of the Group were allocated to the Food segment.

Taxation continued d Temporary differences associated with Group investments At 31 March 2011 a nil tax liability has been recognised 2010: nil in respect of any taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries, as receipt by the Group of any dividends would be exempt from UK corporation tax.
There are no income tax consequences to the Group in relation to dividends paid to Shareholders.
e Change in Corporation Tax rate The March 2011 Budget announced that the UK Corporation tax rate will reduce from 28 per cent to 23 per cent over a period of four years from 2011.
The first reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 28 per cent to 26 per cent was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011 and will be effective from 1 April 2011.
This will reduce the Companys future current tax charge accordingly.
As a consequence, deferred tax has been provided at 26 per cent in the year to 31 March 2011.
The aggregate impact of the proposed reductions from 26 per cent to 23 per cent would reduce the deferred tax liability of the Group by approximately 980,000 and reduce the deferred tax asset of the Company by 32,000.
Sale of a business discontinued operations In the prior year, on 24 April 2009, the Group sold the trade and certain assets and liabilities of the Groups Pet Division to a management buyout team.
Cranswick plc retained a 5.5 per cent share in the business.
The Pet Division manufactured and sold bird food and also imported and sold tropical marine fish and related products.
In accordance with IFRS 5 the results of the Pet Division to the date of sale were treated as discontinued and shown as a single line item at the foot of the income statement.
The results of the pet division for the prior year are presented below: 2011 2010 000 000 Revenue - 3,620 Expenses - 3,580 Operating profit - 40 Finance costs - 10 Profit before tax from discontinued operations - 30 Tax credit - 95 Profit for the period from discontinued operations - 125 The tax credit is analysed as follows: On profit on ordinary activities for the period - 95 The net assets of the Pet Division which were disposed were as follows: 000 Net assets disposed of: Property, plant and equipment 8,210 Inventories 6,447 Trade and other receivables 6,524 Trade and other payables 2,796 18,385 Total consideration satisfied by cash 18,385 Costs associated with disposal, settled in cash 318 Net cash inflow arising on disposal 18,067 72 Report & Accounts 2011 Cranswick plc The net cash flows attributable to the discontinued Pet Division, excluding disposal cash flows were as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Operating cash flows - 448 Financing cash flows - 10 Net outflow - 458 Profit per share from discontinued operations was as follows: Basic - 0.3p Diluted - 0.2p 9.

Earnings per share Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing net profit for the year attributable to members of the parent company of 35,326,000 2010: 32,582,000 by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the year.
In calculating diluted earnings per share amounts, the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for both basic and diluted amounts was as per the table below: 2011 2010 Thousands Thousands Basic weighted average number of shares 47,408 46,534 Dilutive potential ordinary shares share options 162 112 47,570 46,646 Basic weighted average number of shares for 2011 excludes a weighted average of 69,431 shares 2010: 140,515 shares held during the year by the Cranswick plc Employee Benefit Trust.
At 31 March 2011 39,363 shares were held by the Cranswick plc Employee Benefit Trust, the original cost of these shares was 4,000, and the market value of the shares at the year end was 327,000.

As a result of the Deeside cooked meats facility leaving the Group goodwill relating to the cooked meats cash generating unit was reduced proportionately, based on assessment of the relative value of the portion of the cash generating unit disposed of compared to the relative value of the portion of the cash generating unit retained.
During the prior year, the Group acquired 100 per cent of the issued share capital of Bowes of Norfolk Limited now renamed Cranswick Country Foods Norfolk Limited.
Goodwill on acquisition amounted to 12,231,000.
Further details of the acquisition are disclosed in note 16.
Also during the prior year, the Company received a reimbursement of consideration of 1,248,000 from the vendor in relation to an acquisition in a prior year.
The reimbursement was an agreed adjustment in respect of the total amount payable.
The Group has no other intangible assets.
Goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing.
Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to the following principal cash-generating units: Cash generating unit 2011 2010 000 000 Fresh pork 12,231 12,231 Cooked meats 84,679 85,655 Sandwiches 16,526 16,526 Continental Fine Foods 10,968 10,968 Other 3,359 3,359 127,763 128,739 74 Report & Accounts 2011 Cranswick plc Assumptions used The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit has been determined based on value in use calculations using annual budgets for each business for the following year, approved by the Board of Directors, and cash flow projections for the next four years.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure is included from budgets and thereafter capital is assumed to represent 100 per cent of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows are forecast to grow in line with an assumed long-term industry growth rate of between 3 and 5 per cent derived from third party market information, including K World Panel data.
A discount rate of 8.8 per cent has been used 2010: 9.9 per cent being managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital.
The calculation is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Sales volumes Sales volumes are influenced by the growth of the underlying food segment, the market shares of our customers, selling prices, and the quality of our products and service.
Historical volumes are used as the base and adjusted over the projection period in line with current growth rates.
Gross margin Gross margin depends upon average selling prices, the cost of raw materials and changes in the cost of production overheads.
Historical margins are used as the base, adjusted for managements expectations derived from experience and with reference to budget forecasts.
Discount rates All calculations of this nature are sensitive to the discount rate used.
Managements estimate of the Groups weighted average cost of capital has been used for each cash generating unit.
With the exception of the growth rates applied to the Sandwiches cash generating unit, as detailed below, management believes that currently the assumptions used are unlikely to change to an extent which would reduce value in use below the value of the recoverable amount.
Assumptions and projections are updated on an annual basis.
Sensitivity The Sandwiches cash generating unit is the most sensitive to a change in the growth of operating cash flows.
The growth rate applied to Sandwiches is 3 per cent.
A 0.3 per cent reduction in this growth rate to 2.7 per cent would reduce the recoverable amount to a level equal to its carrying value.
Cost includes 1,001,000 2010: 935,000 in respect of capitalised interest.
The depreciation charge for the year for plant, equipment and vehicles includes 42,000 2010: 154,000 in respect of assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts.

The Groups financial liabilities include sterling denominated overdraft balances of 3,718,000 2010: 1,429,000 and euro 207,000 2010: 527,000, all of which are held in the UK.
The proportion of the Groups net assets denominated in foreign currencies is immaterial.
The Groups other financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Credit risk The Group makes a significant proportion of its sales to the major UK supermarket groups, which correspondingly represent a significant proportion of the Groups trade receivables at any one time.
Based on the financial strength of these customers, the Directors do not consider that the Group faces a significant credit risk in this regard.
All cash financial assets are held by UK financial institutions.
The maximum credit exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying values as at the balance sheet date.
Fair value hierarchy The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique: Level 1: quoted unadjusted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable, either directly or indirectly.
Level 3: techniques which use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on observable market data.
The Groups interest rate swap and forward currency contracts, are measured using Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
The Groups put option in relation to its 49 per cent shareholding in Farmers Boy Deeside Limited note 19 is measured using level 3 of the fair value hierarchy.
The fair value of the option is based on discounted cash flows derived from the associates budgets and business plan.
The Directors believe that the most sensitive assumption used within the calculation of the option fair value is the discount rate.
A one per cent movement in the discount rate would give rise to a 0.4 million adjustment in the value of the option if all other assumptions remained unchanged.
The Groups 5.5 per cent retained shareholding in Cranswick Pet & Aquatics Limited described in note 8 would also have been classified as level 3, however as the investment is an unquoted entity and cannot be reliably measured the Directors consider that its value is immaterial and no fair value has been applied.
Financial instruments continued Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.
The fair value of floating rate assets and liabilities is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
All derivative financial instruments are shown in the balance sheet at fair value.
Details of these financial assets and liabilities are included in notes 18 and 20.
88 Report & Accounts 2011 Cranswick plc Hedges Financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges are held at fair value in the balance sheet.
The Group hedges two types of cash flows: i Forward contracts to hedge expected future purchases The Group hedges a proportion of its near-term expected purchases denominated in overseas currencies.
Where these hedges meet the hedge criteria of IAS 39 changes in fair value are posted directly to other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified through the income statement at the time that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Group Fair value Currency Amount Maturities Exchange rates 000 euros 4,500,000 15 April 2011 to 29 June 2011 1.16 1.19 euros 146 These contracts were effective cash flow hedges under the criteria set out in IAS 39 and therefore fair value gains and losses related to the contracts were recognised directly in other comprehensive income.
The Company does not hold any forward contracts.
ii Interest rate swaps The Group hedges a proportion of the interest cash flows payable in respect of bank loans.
Under the terms of the interest rate swap relating to the Groups previous bank facilities, which have now been repaid the Group receives LIBOR interest and pays fixed interest of 2.04 per cent.
The swap was an ineffective cash flow hedge under the criteria set out in IAS 39 and accordingly hedge accounting has ceased.
Therefore movements in fair value have been posted directly to the income statement, and amounts previously taken to other comprehensive income have been reclassified to the income statement.
Interest rate risk The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, of the Groups profit before tax through the impact on floating rate borrowings.
There is no material impact on the Groups equity.
Currency derivatives have not been included in the sensitivity analysis below as they are not considered to be exposed to interest rate risk.

The renegotiation of the Groups banking facilities during the year has extended the maturity of a significant proportion of the Groups debt.
The impact of liquidity risk on the Group is discussed in detail in the Group Operating and Financial Review on page 16.

The total expense charged to the income statement during the year in relation to share-based payments was 1,013,000 2010: 510,000.
Executive Share Option Scheme Share options are granted periodically to promote the involvement of senior management in the longer term success of the Group.
Options can only be exercised if certain performance conditions are met by the Group.
These conditions are based on Total Shareholder Return over the performance period and require the Group to be in the top half of a basket of food companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange selected by the remuneration Committee.
Options have a contractual life of ten years, being the maximum term.
Directors may also apply for SAYE options on the same terms as apply to all other employees.

The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
The initial fair value of LTIP options is adjusted to take into account market-based performance conditions.
Pension schemes Defined benefit pension scheme The Group acquired a defined benefit final salary pension scheme during the prior year, which is funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The scheme was closed to new members and future accrual on 30 June 2004.
Pension costs are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation using the projected unit credit method.
The latest available formal actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2010.
This valuation was updated to the year end.
Plan assets are stated at fair value at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by applying published brokers forecasts to each category of scheme assets.

A 0.1 per cent decrease in the discount rate would give rise to a 16,000 decrease in the amounts charged to the income statement during the year, and a 271,000 increase in the deficit at 31 March 2011.
The scheme rules require the pension benefits to be uplifted by Retail Price Index RPI, so there was no financial effect from the statutory requirement to uplift pension benefits by Consumer Price index CPI rather than RPI.
