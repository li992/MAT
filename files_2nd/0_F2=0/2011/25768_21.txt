Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31st December 2011 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006, United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies and Venture Capital Trusts the SORP issued by the Association of Investment Companies in January 2009.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
The disclosures on going concern on page 25 of the Directors Report form part of these accounts.
The policies applied in these accounts are consistent with those applied in the preceding year.
b Valuation of investments The Companys business is investing in financial assets with a view to profiting from their total return in the form of income and capital growth.
This portfolio of financial assets is managed and its performance evaluated on a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented investment strategy and information is provided internally on that basis to the Companys Board of Directors.
Accordingly, upon initial recognition the investments are designated by the Company as held at fair value through profit or loss.
They are included initially at fair value which is taken to be their cost, excluding expenses incidental to purchase which are written off in the capital column of the income statement at the time of acquisition.
Subsequently the investments are valued at fair value, which are quoted bid prices for investments traded in active markets.
For investments which are not traded in active markets, unlisted and restricted investments, the Board takes into account the latest traded prices, other observable market data and asset values based on the latest management accounts.
All purchases and sales are accounted for on a trade date basis.
c Accounting for reserves Gains and losses on sales of investments including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, realised exchange gains and losses on cash and short term deposits, realised gains and losses on foreign currency contracts, any performance fee realised, management fee and finance costs allocated to capital and any other capital charges, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Gains and losses on sales of investments.
Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end including the related foreign exchange gains and losses, unrealised gains and losses on forward foreign currency contracts and any performance fee provison, are included in the Income Statement and dealt with in capital reserves within Holding gains and losses on investments.
d Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are included in revenue on an ex-dividend basis except where, in the opinion of the Board, the dividend is capital in nature, in which case it is included in capital.
Overseas dividends are included gross of any withholding tax.
Where the Company has elected to receive scrip dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend foregone is recognised in revenue.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital.
Interest receivable from debt securities together with any premiums or discounts on purchase are allocated to revenue on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective interest rate of those securities.
Deposit interest receivable is taken to revenue on an accruals basis.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are allocated wholly to revenue with the following exceptions: any performance fee is allocated 100% to capital.
the management fee is allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
expenses incidental to the purchase of an investment are included within the cost of the investment and those incidental to the sale are deducted from the sale proceeds.
These expenses are commonly referred to as transaction costs and comprise mainly brokerage commission.
Details of transaction costs are given in note 10 on page 46. f Finance costs Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis using the effective interest rate method in accordance with the provisions of FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Presentation and FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement.
Finance costs are allocated 20% to revenue and 80% to capital in line with the Boards expected long term split of revenue and capital return from the Companys investment portfolio.
g Financial instruments Cash and short term deposits may comprise cash and demand deposits which are readily convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Other debtors and creditors do not carry any interest, are short term in nature and are accordingly stated at nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
The debenture in issue, bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Finance costs, including any premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest rate method.
Forward foreign currency contracts are included in the balance sheet as derivative financial instruments and are carried at fair value, which is the cost of closing out those contracts.
Changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in profit or loss as they arise.
h Foreign currency In accordance with FRS 23: The effects of changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates the Company is required to nominate a functional currency, being the currency in which the Company predominantly operates.
The Board, having regard to the currency of the Companys share capital and the predominant currency in which its shareholders operate, has determined that sterling is the functional currency.
Sterling is also the currency in which the accounts are presented.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are converted at actual exchange rates at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated at the rates of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent to the date of the transaction is included in the income statement as an exchange gain or loss in revenue or capital, depending on whether the gain or loss is of a revenue or capital nature.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 41 Notes to the Accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued i Taxation Current tax is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or received.
Deferred tax is accounted for in accordance with FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable timing differences but deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that taxable profits will be available against which those timing differences can be utilised.
Tax relief is allocated to expenses charged to capital on the marginal basis.
On this basis, if taxable income is capable of being entirely offset by revenue expenses, then no tax relief is allocated to capital.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rate which is expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and is measured on an undiscounted basis.
j Dividends payable In accordance with FRS 21: Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the final dividend is included in the accounts in the year in which it is approved by shareholders.
k Value Added Tax VAT Irrecoverable VAT is included in the expense on which it has been suffered.
Recoverable VAT is calculated using the partial exemption method based on the proportion of zero rated supplies to total supplies.
Gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss Gains on sales of investments held at fair value through profit or loss based on historical cost 10,802 36,792 Amounts recognised in investment holding gains and losses in the previous year in respect of investments sold during the year 18,088 26,992 Losses gains on sales of investments based on the carrying value at the previous balance sheet date 7,286 9,800 Net movement in investment holding gains and losses 8,554 47,450 Other capital charges 8 11 Total capital gains on investments held at fair value through profit or loss 1,260 57,239 42 JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 American pp40 59 American pp40 59 26 03 2012 15:16 Page 45 c Deferred taxation The Company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of 9,333,000 2010: 8,455,000 based on a prospective corporation tax rate of 25% 2010: 27%.
The reduction in the standard rate of corporation tax was substantively enacted on 5th July 2011 and is effective from 1st April 2012.
The deferred tax asset has arisen due to the cumulative excess of deductible expenses over taxable income.
Given the composition of the Companys portfolio, it is not likely that this asset will be utilised in the foreseeable future and therefore no asset has been recognised in the accounts.
Given the Companys status as an Investment Trust Company and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain such approval, the Company has not provided for deferred tax on any capital gains or losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.

Disclosures regarding financial instruments measured at fair value The disclosures required by the amendment to FRS 29: Improving Disclosures about Financial Instruments are given below.
The Companys financial instruments within the scope of FRS 29 that are held at fair value comprise its investment portfolio and derivative financial instruments.

Level 2valued by reference to valuation techniques using observable inputs other than quoted market prices included within Level 1.
Level 3valued by reference to valuation techniques using inputs that are not based on observable market data.
Categorisation within the hierarchy has been determined on the basis of the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement of the relevant asset.
Details of the valuation techniques used by the Company are given in note 1 b on page 40.
The following table sets out the fair value measurements using the FRS 29 hierarchy at 31st December.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies As an investment trust, the Company invests in equities and other securities for the long term so as to secure its investment objective stated on the Features page.
In pursuing this objective, the Company is exposed to a variety of risks that could result in a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction in the profits available for dividends.
These risks include market risk comprising currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The Directors policy for managing these risks is set out below.
The Company Secretary, in close cooperation with the Board and the Manager, coordinates the Companys risk management strategy.
The objectives, policies and processes for managing the risks and the methods used to measure the risks that are set out below, have not changed from those applying in the comparative year.
The Companys financial instruments may comprise: investments in US equity shares and a $ liquidity fund, which are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective: short term debtors, creditors and cash arising directly from its operations: a debenture issued by the Company, the purpose of which is to finance the Companys operations: and forward foreign currency contracts, the purpose of which is to manage the currency risk arising from the Companys investment activities.
a Market risk The fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument held by the Company may fluctuate because of changes in market prices.
This market risk comprises three elements currency risk, interest rate risk and other price risk.
Information to enable an evaluation of the nature and extent of these three elements of market price risk is given in parts i to iii to this note, together with sensitivity analyses where appropriate.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing these risks and these policies have remained unchanged from those applying in the comparative year.
The Manager assesses the exposure to market risk when making each investment decision and monitors the overall level of market risk on the whole of the investment portfolio on an ongoing basis.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 i Currency risk The majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than sterling which is the Companys functional currency and the currency in which it reports.
As a result, movements in exchange rates will affect the sterling value of those items.
Management of currency risk The Manager monitors the Companys exposure to foreign currencies on a daily basis and reports to the Board, which meets on at least four occasions each year.
The Manager measures the risk to the Company of the foreign currency exposure by considering the effect on the Companys net asset value and income of a movement in the rates of exchange to which the Companys assets, liabilities, income and expenses are exposed.
The Company has a 50 million debenture in issue which is repayable in June 2018.
It is the Company's policy to hedge the currency risk in respect of this geared portion of the portfolio.
At the beginning of the year, the Company had a contract in place with The Royal Bank of Scotland to purchase 50 million for settlement in $, and which duly settled on 5th October 2011.
The Company has continued this hedging policy using three month forward contracts.
At 31st December 2011 the Company held a number of open contracts with State Street, Barclays and Credit Suisse.
The net effect of these contracts is to purchase 50 million for settlement in $ and the latest settlement date of these contracts is 4th April 2012.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
The Company does not use financial instruments to mitigate the currency exposure in the period between the time that income is included in the financial statements and its receipt.
Foreign currency exposure The fair value of the Companys monetary items that have foreign currency exposure at 31st December are shown below.
Where the Companys equity investments, which are not monetary items, are priced in a foreign currency, they have been included separately in the analysis so as to show the overall level of exposure.
2011 2010 $ $ 000 000 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are monetary items 36,156 29,831 Cash and short term deposits 24,835 30 Debtors securities sold awaiting settlement, overseas tax recoverable, dividends and interest receivable 445 1,556 Creditors securities purchased awaiting settlement 35 Forward foreign currency contracts 50,034 46,686 Foreign currency exposure on net monetary items 11,402 15,304 Investments held at fair value through profit or loss that are equities 389,086 389,743 Total net foreign currency exposure 400,488 374,439 The above year end amounts are broadly representative of the exposure to currency risk during the current and comparative year.

Financial instruments exposure to risk and risk management policies continued a Market risk continued i Currency risk continued Foreign currency sensitivity The following tables illustrate the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets with regard to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities and exchange rates.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary currency financial instruments held at each balance sheet date and the income receivable in foreign currency and assumes a 10% 2010: 10% appreciation or depreciation of sterling against the $ which is deemed to be a reasonable illustration based on the volatility of exchange rates during the year.
If sterling had weakened by 10% 2010: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2011 2010 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 768 702 Capital return 1,140 1,530 Total return after taxation for the year 1,908 828 Net assets 1,908 828 If sterling had strengthened by 10% 2010: 10% against the $ this would have had the following effect: 2011 2010 000 000 Income statement return after taxation Revenue return 768 702 Capital return 1,140 1,530 Total return after taxation for the year 1,908 828 Net assets 1,908 828 In the opinion of the Directors, the above sensitivity analyses with respect to monetary financial assets and liabilities are broadly representative of the whole of the current and comparative year.
The sensitivity with regard to the Companys investments and foreign currency is subsumed into other price risk sensitivity on page 56. ii Interest rate risk Interest rate movements may affect the level of income receivable on cash deposits and the liquidity fund.
The Companys exposure to floating interest rates, giving cash flow interest rate risk when rates are re-set, is as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Exposure to floating interest rates Cash and short term deposits 24,835 30 JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund 36,156 29,831 Total exposure 60,991 29,861 54 JPMorgan American Investment Trust plc.
Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Interest receivable on cash balances is at a margin below LIBOR and interest payable on overdrafts is at a margin over LIBOR or its foreign currency equivalent 2010: same.
The target interest earned on the JPMorgan US Dollar Liquidity Fund is the 7 day $ London Interbank Bid Rate 2010: same.
The 50 million debenture, which the Company has in issue, carries a fixed interest rate of 6.875% until the repayment date in June 2018.
The above year end exposures are not necessarily representative of the exposure to interest rates during the year as the cash balances and investments in the liquidity fund have fluctuated.
The maximum and minimum exposures during the year, arising from cash balances and the liquidity fund were as follows: 2011 2010 000 000 Maximum interest rate exposure to floating rates 74,756 31,667 Minimum interest rate exposure to floating rates 29,861 3,485 Interest rate sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to a 0.5% 2010: 1% increase or decrease in interest rates in regards to the Companys monetary financial assets and financial liabilities.
This level of change is considered to be a reasonable illustration based on observation of current market conditions.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys monetary financial instruments held at the balance sheet date, with all other variables held constant.

iii Other price risk Other price risk includes changes in market prices, other than those arising from interest rate risk or currency risk, which may affect the value of equity investments.
Management of other price risk The Board meets on at least four occasions each year to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors.
The investment management team has responsibility for monitoring the portfolio, which is selected in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and seeks to ensure that individual stocks meet an acceptable risk reward profile.

Concentration of exposure to other price risk A list of the Companys investments is given on pages 17 to 19.
This shows that all of the investments value is in the USA.
Accordingly, there is a concentration of exposure to that country.
However, it should be noted that an investment may not be entirely exposed to the economic conditions in its country of domicile or of listing.
Other price risk sensitivity The following table illustrates the sensitivity of the return after taxation for the year and net assets to an increase or decrease of 10% 2010: 10% in the market value of equity investments.
The sensitivity analysis is based on the Companys equities and includes the impact on the management fee but assumes all other variables are held constant.

Management of the risk Liquidity risk is not significant as the Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding requirements if necessary.

Annual Report & Accounts 2011 Liquidity risk exposure Contractual maturities of the financial liabilities at the year end, based on the earliest date on which payment can be required are as follows: 2011 More than Three three months months but not more More than or less than one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock including interest 3,438 68,906 72,344 Securities purchased awaiting settlement Other creditors and accruals 77 77 Performance fee payable Derivative financial instruments 586 586 663 3,438 68,906 73,007 2010 More than Three three months months but not more More than or less than one year one year Total 000 000 000 000 Debenture stock including interest 3,438 72,343 75,781 Securities purchased awaiting settlement 35 35 Other creditors and accruals 109 109 Performance fee payable 383 383 Derivative financial instruments 527 3,438 72,343 76,308 The liabilities shown above against debenture stock are the undiscounted contractual amounts that are to be paid and, as such differ from the amounts shown in the balance sheet.
c Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a transaction fails to discharge its obligations under that transaction which could result in loss to the Company.
Management of credit risk Portfolio dealing The Company invests in markets that operate DVP Delivery Versus Payment settlement.
The process of DVP mitigates the risk of losing the principal of a trade during the settlement process.
The Manager regularly monitors dealing activity to ensure best execution, a process that involves measuring various indicators including the quality of trade settlement and incidence of failed trades.
Counterparty lists are maintained and adjusted accordingly.

Exposure to JPMorgan Chase JPMorgan Chase is the custodian of the Companys assets.
The Companys assets are segregated from JPMorgan Chases own trading assets.
Therefore these assets are designed to be protected from creditors in the event that JPMorgan Chase were to cease trading.
However, no absolute guarantee can be given on the protection of all the assets of the Company.
The following amounts shown in the Balance Sheet, represent the maximum exposure to credit risk at the current and comparative year end.

This Fund has been given a AAA credit rating by Standard & Poors.
The Funds investments comprise mainly certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and floating rate notes with a weighted average maturity of 45 days.
There has been no stock lending during the year.
Cash and short term deposits comprise balances held at banks that have a minimum rating of A1 P1 2010: A1 P1 from Standard & Poors and Moodys respectively.
d Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All financial assets and liabilities are either included in the balance sheet at fair value or the carrying value in the balance sheet is a reasonable approximation of fair value except for the debenture which the Company has in issue.
The fair value of the 50 million debenture issued by the Company has been calculated using discounted cash flow techniques, using the yield from a similarly dated gilt plus a margin based on the 5 year average for the AA Barclays Sterling Corporate Bond spread.
This is a change in methodology from that used in prior years and the comparative has been restated.
The fair value of the debenture was previously estimated using Bloomberg to calculate a market value based on a similarly dated gilt yield plus the margin.
The comparative fair value calculated on this basis as previously stated was 59.2 million.

Capital management policies and procedures The Companys debt and capital structure comprises the following: 2011 2010 000 000 Debt: 50,000,000 6.875% debenture June 2018 50,000 50,000 50,000 50,000 Equity: Equity share capital 11,551 10,713 Reserves 388,828 363,307 400,379 374,020 Total debt and equity 450,379 424,020 The Companys capital management objectives are to ensure that it will continue as a going concern and seek to maximise income and capital return to its equity shareholders through an appropriate level of gearing.
The Boards policy is to limit gearing within the range 95% to 120%.
Gearing for this purpose is defined as investments, excluding liquidity fund holdings, expressed as a percentage of total net assets.
2011 2010 000 000 Investments excluding liquidity fund holdings 389,086 389,743 Net assets 400,379 374,020 Gearing 97.2% 104.2% The Board, with the assistance of the Manager, monitors and reviews the broad structure of the Companys capital on an ongoing basis.
This includes a review of: the planned level of gearing, which takes into account the Managers views on the market: the need to buy back equity shares, either for cancellation or to hold in Treasury, which takes into account the share price discount or premium: the need for issues of new shares, including issues from Treasury: and the extent to which revenue in excess of that which is required to be distributed should be retained.
