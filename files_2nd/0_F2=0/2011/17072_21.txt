Retirement benefit obligation WH Smith PLC has operated a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans.
The main pension arrangements for employees are operated through a defined benefit scheme, WHSmith Pension Trust, and a defined contribution scheme, WHSmith Retirement Savings Plan.
The most significant scheme is WHSmith Pension Trust, which is described in Note 4 a i.
The retirement benefit obligations recognised in the balance sheet within non-current liabilities for the respective schemes at the relevant reporting dates were: m 2011 2010 WHSmith Pension Trust United News Shops Retirement Benefits Scheme 1 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet 1 a Defined benefit pension schemes i The WHSmith Pension Trust The WHSmith Pension Trust was closed to defined benefit service accrual on 2 April 2007 and has been closed to new members since 1996.
The WHSmith Pension Trust is independent of the Group and is administered by a Trustee.
In September 2005, the Pension Trust Trustee adopted a new investment policy.
The assets in the investment fund were restructured and substantially invested such that they are expected to alter in value in line with changes in the pension liability caused by changes in interest and inflation a Liability Driven Investment LDI policy.
A full actuarial valuation of the Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Pension Trust was carried out as at 31 March 2009 by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
Following this valuation, the deficit was 113m, and a revised deficit funding schedule of 11m per annum subject to indexation over the following ten years was agreed with the Trustee.
During the year, the Group made a contribution of 14m to the WHSmith Pension Trust 2010: 13m in accordance with the agreed pension deficit funding schedule, which includes a catch-up payment relating to the period from 31 March 2009 to the date that the revised contributions started to be paid.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in relation to this plan are as follows: m 2011 2010 Present value of the obligations 716 761 Fair value of plan assets 785 786 Surplus in the scheme 69 25 Amounts not recognised 69 25 Retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet The pension scheme is closed to further accrual and given the LDI policy adopted by the Pension Trustee, the present value of the economic benefits of the IAS 19 surplus in the pension scheme of 69m 2010: 25m available on a reduction of future contributions is nil 2010: nil.
As a result the Group has not recognised this IAS 19 surplus on the balance sheet.
Following a change in investment managers the fair value of plan assets at 31 August 2010 has been re-presented to reflect a change in valuation on a section of the schemes assets.
This has no impact on the Groups primary statements as at 31 August 2010.
Included in the movement in the surplus during the period is the effect of the switch from RPI to CPI on future deferred member liabilities.
The valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme used for the IAS 19 disclosures is based upon the most recent valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at the relevant reporting date.
The principal long-term assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were: % 2011 2010 Rate of increase in pension payments 3.52 3.26 Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.62 3.26 Discount rate 5.37 4.87 RPI inflation assumption 3.52 3.26 CPI inflation assumption 2.62 The amounts recognised in the income statement were as follows: m 2011 2010 Current service cost Interest cost 37 37 Expected return on scheme assets 38 37 1 WH Smith PLC WH Smith PLC Annual report and accounts 2011 49 Annual report and accounts 2011 49 38-71. indd 49 17 11 2011 12:16 F Fi in na an nc ci ia al l s st ta at te em me en nt ts s N No ot te es s t to o t th he e a ac cc co ou un ntts s c c o o n n tt in in u u ee dd 4.

Management has determined that no impairment was necessary for the current financial year 2010: nil.
All goodwill relates to the acquisitions of groups of retail stores and each CGU is sensitive to movements in the same key assumptions.
The key assumptions on which forecast three-year cash flows of the CGUs are based include sales growth, product mix and operating costs.
The values assigned to each of these assumptions were determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends within the Group, and external information on expected future trends in the UK retail industry.
These cash flows are extrapolated for an additional nine years representing the average length of the lease for the relevant group of stores based on long-term growth rates.
The long-term growth rates used are between 2.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent, reflecting expected retail price index growth.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is ten per cent pre-tax 2010: ten per cent.
A sensitivity analysis has been performed in assessing recoverable amounts of goodwill.
This has been based on changes in key assumptions considered to be possible by management.
This included an increase in the discount rate of up to one per cent and a decrease in the long-term growth rate of up to one per cent.
The sensitivity analysis shows that no impairment would arise under each scenario.

Other intangible assets Other intangible assets comprise capitalised software costs that are not deemed to be an integral part of the related hardware which is classified within property, plant and equipment and certain tenancy rights.
The amortisation period for capitalised software costs is over a maximum period of five years.
Other intangible assets are either considered to have an indefinite life, therefore no amortisation has been charged, or are amortised over their useful economic life.
These assets are reviewed annually for impairment.

Included in other intangible assets are certain assets considered to have an indefinite life, representing certain rights under tenancy agreements, which include the right to renew leases.
Management has determined that the useful economic life of these assets is indefinite because the Company can continue to occupy and trade from certain premises for an indefinite period.
During the period the Group acquired 22 leasehold properties, together with the associated employees, from the administrators of British Bookshops and Stationers Limited in administration for a cash consideration of 1m.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 1m, being intangible assets relating to tenancy rights.
Details of revenues and profits generated have not been disclosed as the revenue generated is not material in the context of these financial statements.
No pro forma information for the financial year has been included, as the acquired stores have been amalgamated within the existing store portfolio rendering any disclosure impractical.

This allowance reflects the application of the Groups provisioning policy in respect of bad and doubtful debts and is based upon the difference between the receivable value and the estimated net collectible amount.
The Group establishes its provision for bad and doubtful debts by reference to past default experience.
No collateral is held for amounts past due but not impaired.
No trade and other receivables that would have been past due or impaired were renegotiated during the year.
No interest is charged on the receivables balance.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not include impaired assets.

The costs include provision for required dilapidation costs and any anticipated future rental shortfalls.
This provision has been discounted at ten per cent, and this discount will be unwound over the life of the leases.
The disposal provision arose from commitments in respect of the disposal of the USA Travel business.
The remaining provision will predominantly be utilised over the next few years.
The contingent consideration provision relates to the acquisition for Spilt Ink Studio Limited during the prior year.
Additional consideration will be paid to the former owners of Spilt Ink Studio Limited if the company reaches certain financial and non-financial targets during the years ended 31 August 2011 and 31 August 2012.

As deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods of reversal, we have restated all deferred tax closing balances using a rate of 25 per cent.
The change of rate in the year decreased the net deferred tax asset by nil 2010: nil.
The future one per cent main rate of corporation tax reductions are expected to have a similar impact on the financial statements as outlined above, however the actual impact will be dependent on the deferred tax position at that time.
Certain deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset.
The following is an analysis of the deferred tax balances, after offset, for financial reporting purposes.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
The Group has in place a five-year committed multi-currency revolving credit facility of 70m.
The revolving credit facility is due to mature on 24 January 2016.
The utilisation is interest-bearing at LIBOR plus 110 basis points.
Utilisation at 31 August 2011 was nil, and the utilisation of the previous facility as at 31 August 2010 was nil.
Contingent liabilities and capital commitments m 2011 2010 Bank and other loans guaranteed 3 4 Other potential liabilities that could crystallise are in respect of previous assignments of leases where the liability could revert to the Group if the lessee defaulted.
Pursuant to the terms of the Demerger Agreement with Smiths News PLC, any such contingent liability which becomes an actual liability, will be apportioned between the Group and Smiths News PLC in the ratio 65:35 provided that the actual liability of Smiths News PLC in any 12-month period does not exceed 5m.
The Groups 65 per cent share of these leases has an estimated future rental commitment at 31 August 2010 of 30m 2010: 40m.
The movement in the future rental commitment is due to the crystallisation of lease liabilities, lease expiries and the effluxion of time.
Contracts placed for future capital expenditure approved by the directors but not provided for in this combined financial information amount to 2m 2010: nil.

Comparison of carrying values and fair values There were no material differences between the carrying value of non-derivative financial assets and financial liabilities and their fair values as at the balance sheet date.
Risk management The Groups Treasury function seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate, foreign exchange and other financial risks, and to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
The Groups treasury policies and procedures are periodically reviewed and approved by the Groups Audit Committee and are subject to regular Group Internal Audit review.
Capital risk The Groups objectives with respect to managing capital defined as net debt funds plus equity are to safeguard the Groups ability to continue as a going concern, in order to optimise returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
In managing the Groups capital levels the Board regularly monitors the level of debt in the business, the working capital requirements, forecast financing and investing cash flows.
Based on this analysis, the Board determines the appropriate return to investors while ensuring sufficient capital is retained in the business to meet its strategic objectives.
The Board has a progressive dividend policy and expects that, over time, dividends would be broadly covered twice by earnings calculated on a normalised tax basis.
As at 13 October 2011 the Group has in place a 70m committed multi-currency revolving credit facility, carrying certain financial covenants which have been met throughout the period.
The covenants, tested half-yearly, are based on fixed charges cover and net borrowings.
Liquidity risk The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow forecasts.
The Group has a committed facility with a number of financial institutions which are available to be drawn for general corporate purposes including working capital.
Treasury has a policy of pooling Group cash flows in order to optimise the return on surplus cash and also to utilise cash within the Group to reduce the costs of external short-term funding.

The Groups principal financial assets are trade and other receivables and bank balances and cash.
The Group has credit risk attributable to its trade and other receivables including a number of sale or return contracts with suppliers.
The amounts included in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows.
The Group has low retail credit risk due to the transactions being principally of a high volume, low value and short maturity.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is considered to be low, as the Board approved Group Treasury Policy limits the value that can be placed with each approved counterparty to minimise the risk of loss.
These limits are based on a combination of short-term credit ratings of P-1 A-1 and long-term ratings of A1 A or better.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements represents the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk.
The Group does not hold collateral over any of these financial assets.
Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to cash flow interest rate risk on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.
At 31 August 2011, the Group had drawn down nil 2010: nil from its committed revolving credit facility.
The Group draws down periodically on its facility, but does not view any draw down as long term in nature and therefore does not enter into interest rate derivatives to mitigate this risk.
Foreign currency risk Foreign exchange rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of the changes in foreign exchange rates.
The Groups foreign currency exposures are principally to the US dollar, euro and Australian dollar.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
The hedging instruments have been used to hedge purchases in US dollars and to minimise foreign exchange risk in movements of the USD GBP exchange rates.
These are designated as cash flow hedges.
At 31 August 2011, the Group had no material un-hedged currency exposures.
The Groups euro and Australian dollar exposure is principally operational and arises mainly through the operation of retail stores in France, Ireland and Australia.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposure.
The fair value of cash flow hedges recognised on the balance sheet within derivative assets liabilities is shown below: m 2011 2010 Fair value of derivative assets At 31 August 2011, the total notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts to which the Group has committed is US$47m 2010: US$29m.
These instruments will be used to hedge cash flows occurring within up to two years of the balance sheet date.
Gains totalling nil 2010: 2m have been transferred to both the income statement and inventories in respect of contracts that matured during the year ended 31 August 2011.

The following analysis, required by IFRS 7, Financial Instruments: Disclosures, is intended to illustrate the sensitivity to changes in market variables, being UK interest rates, and USD GBP and EUR GBP exchange rates.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis: Exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash flow hedge relationship affect the hedging reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.
Group debt and hedging activities remain constant, reflecting the positions at 31 August 2010 and 31 August 2011 respectively.
As a consequence, the analysis relates to the position at those dates and is not necessarily representative of the years then ended.
The above assumptions are made when illustrating the effect on the Groups income statement and equity given reasonable movements in foreign exchange and interest rates before the effect of tax.
The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in GBP LIBOR Base rate to be one per cent, based on interest rate history.
Similarly, sensitivity to movements in USD GBP and EUR GBP exchange rates of ten per cent are shown, reflecting changes of reasonable proportion in the context of movement in those currency pairs over time.
Using these assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the Group Income Statement and equity.
