In addition, the cost of own shares held must now be recognised as a reduction in distributable profits and accordingly 1.7m has been debited to the profit and loss account reserve.

com 43 Notes to the accounts 20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Group operations are financed through a combination of shareholders funds and net borrowings, comprising bank and loan facilities.
The core element of the Groups borrowing requirement is provided by long term fixed interest loan notes.
The Group has limited its use of financial instruments to derivatives designed to protect the Group from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
The remaining borrowing requirement is funded principally through a revolving credit facility with variable interest rates.
This policy has remained in force during the year ended 31st October 2004.
All debtors and creditors due within one year have, as permitted, been excluded from the disclosure requirements of FRS13.
Financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the financial liabilities of the Group was: Floating rate Fixed rate Financial financial financial liabilities carrying Sterling liabilities liabilities no interest Total m m m m At 31st October 2004 Bank borrowings, loan notes and long term creditors 69.2 120.1 225.3 414.6 Preference shares - 38.0 - 38.0 69.2 158.1 225.3 452.6 At 31st October 2003 Bank borrowings, loan notes and long term creditors 17.0 120.1 127.8 264.9 Preference shares - 38.0 - 38.0 17.0 158.1 127.8 302.9 Fixed rate financial liabilities are stated after cross currency swaps which had the effect of reclassifying $166m 2003 $166m US dollar borrowings into 110.1m 2003 110.1m sterling borrowings.
The fixed rate financial liabilities are at a weighted average of 7.43% 2003 7.43% fixed for an average of 4.8 years 2003 5.8 years.
The terms relating to the preference shares are set out in Note 15.
The floating rate financial liabilities are subject to interest rates referenced to LIBOR.
These rates are for a period between one and twelve months.
For financial liabilities which have no interest payable, consisting of land creditors, the weighted average period to maturity is 33 months 2003 33 months.
The fair value of these liabilities at 31st October 2004 is 192.2m 2003 108.8m.
The discount rate applied is equivalent to the Group's current incremental borrowing rate.
There are no other material differences between book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
The Company has a number of guarantees in place as described in Note 22 which are contingent liabilities and therefore have no book value and it is not practical to estimate their fair value.
The maturity of the financial liabilities is: 2004 2003 m m Repayable within one year 3.2 2.0 Repayable between one and two years 97.4 48.0 Repayable between two and five years 243.7 141.5 Repayable after five years 108.3 111.4 452.6 302.9 Financial assets Financial assets of the Group at 31st October 2004 consisted of sterling cash deposits of 10.9m 2003 55.2m placed overnight, with solicitors and on current account.
Undrawn borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 164.9m 2003 214.7m at 31st October 2004.
The repayment terms of the facilities are set out in Note 12.
In addition there were undrawn guarantee and bonding facilities of 55.8m 2003 46.0m.
com Notes to the accounts 21 PENSIONS Defined contribution scheme The Group operates a defined contribution scheme for new employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
The service cost of this scheme for the year was 0.4m 2003 0.5m.
At the balance sheet date there were no outstanding or prepaid contributions 2003 Nil.
Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme which is closed to new entrants.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, being invested in managed funds.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees' working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of a market-based triennial valuation using the attained age method.
In addition to the main scheme, the Group also operates a Top Hat arrangement consisting of individual policies.
This arrangement is a non-contributory, targeted money purchase arrangement designed to give certain Executive Directors and a former Company Secretary benefits additional to those in the main scheme.
Contributions to each policy are determined annually by the Companys advisers.
For SSAP24 and FRS17 purposes the Top Hat arrangement has been treated as a final salary arrangement.
The most recent funding valuation of the main scheme was carried out as at 1st February 2004 and the most significant assumptions adopted were: Investment returns before retirement 6.75% per annum Investment returns after retirement 6.00% per annum Salary increases 4.00% per annum Pensions increases in respect of benefits earned before 6th April 1997 3.00% per annum Pensions increases in respect of benefits earned after 5th April 1997 2.40% per annum After taking account of the above assumptions, the actuarial value of the scheme's assets represented 80% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The market value of these assets was estimated at 49m excluding pensions in payment secured by purchasing annuities from an insurance company.
The assumptions used for SSAP24 purposes were the same as those shown above with the following exceptions: Investment returns after retirement 6.75% per annum Salary increases 3.75% per annum The combined pension charge for the year was 2.8m 2003 3.1m.
The actual contribution paid by the Company was 2.6m 2003 2.9m which resulted in a prepayment at the year end of 2.3m 2003 2.5m.
The method used for spreading the deficit was the Level Percentage Method.
Additional disclosure required by FRS17 In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS17, a full actuarial valuation update of the defined benefit scheme and the Top Hat arrangement was carried out by a qualified actuary as at 31st October 2004.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 2004 2003 2002 Discount rate 5.4% 5.5% 5.6% Inflation 2.9% 2.7% 2.3% Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9% 3.7% 3.3% Rate of increase in pensions in payment: Earned before 6th April 1997 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% Earned after 5th April 1997 2.6% 2.4% 2.0% www.
