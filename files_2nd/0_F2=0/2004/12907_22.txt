70 RAC plc Annual report and accounts 2004 33 Pension schemes The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for pension costs, see a and b below.
The relevant transitional disclosures under FRS17 Retirement benefits, are shown in section c. The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for eligible UK employees.
The assets of these schemes are held independently from those of RAC plc, its subsidiaries and joint venture undertakings.
RAC plcs pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread them systematically over employees working lives with the Group.
a RAC 2003 Pension Scheme The RAC 2003 Pension Scheme the Scheme is a funded defined benefit scheme and was formerly called the Lex Service Pension Scheme.
It was renamed on 11 February 2003 following the transfer on 1 January 2002 of the assets and liabilities of the RAC Pension Scheme into the assets and liabilities of the Lex Service Pension Scheme.
The most recent actuarial valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2004 by an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method on an ongoing basis.
The principal assumptions applied in the valuation calculations were: Pre-retirement interest 6.9% p. a. Post-retirement interest 5.7% p. a.
Increases in pensionable salaries 4.0% p. a.
In addition, the valuation included an allowance for discretionary increases in payment of 1.67% p. a. relating to service before 6 April 1997 for former Lex Service Pension Scheme members and an allowance of 2.5% p. a. for former members of the RAC Pension Scheme.
An allowance of 2.5% p. a. is also made for guaranteed pension increases relating to service after 5 April 1997 pensions relating to service after 5 April 1997 are guaranteed to increase in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% p. a.. At the date of the valuation, the discounted value of the assets of the Scheme was 492.5 million, which was sufficient to cover 79% of the benefits which had accrued to members, allowing for future expected increases in earnings.
The cost of providing pension benefits for the future has increased.
This is primarily because people are living longer, typically drawing a pension for twice as long as they did in the 1960s, which requires a proportionate increase in funding.
In addition, tax changes and lower anticipated investment returns are also increasing the cost of funding the Scheme.
To maintain the Scheme, the Group has shared the increase in costs with employees, who during 2003 were offered the choice of reduced future benefit levels or increased employee contribution rates from 1 July 2003.
The Group has also increased its contributions into the pension fund.
For determining pension cost, the shortfall of the market value of assets over liabilities is spread throughout the expected remaining service lives of employees currently in the Scheme.
The total pension cost, including administration costs, of the merged Scheme was 23.5 million 2003 21.8 million of which 3.2 million 2003 2.6 million was attributable to joint venture undertakings.
A net prepayment of 3.0 million 2003 3.0 million is included in the balance sheet.
b Other schemes The Group operates a number of smaller defined benefits and defined contribution schemes.
The aggregate total pension cost of these schemes was 1.5 million 2003 1.5 million.

End of life vehicles Directive In September 2000, the European Parliament passed Directive 2000 53 EC on end of life vehicles.
As part of this Directive, vehicle manufacturers and professional vehicle importers would be responsible for a significant part of the end of life costs of collecting, disposing and recycling new cars put on the road from 1 July 2002, and from 1 January 2007, for cars put on the road before 2002.
There are a number of uncertainties surrounding the exact form and implementation of the legislation in the UK regarding vehicles registered prior to 1 July 2002.
Although industry estimates have been made, the Directors consider that they believe there is still insufficient information available to them to allow the assessment of the form or value of any obligations that may fall to the Group.
RAC plc Annual report and accounts 2004 73 Notes to the accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2004 36 Financial instruments a Objective for holding or issuing financial instruments The principal financial instruments held or issued by the Group are as follows: cash: debt, including loan notes and finance lease obligations: forward foreign exchange contracts: interest rate and currency swaps: and certain debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial instrument as set out in FRS13.
The Groups main objectives for holding cash are to meet day to day working capital and investment needs and to comply with regulatory requirements: forward foreign exchange contracts are held for hedging purposes as are interest rate and currency swaps.
The debtors, creditors and provisions arise directly as part of the Groups operations.
The main risks which the holding and issuing of financial instruments seek to control are liquidity risk, interest rate risk and exchange rate risk.
An explanation of the Boards objectives, policies and strategies for holding and issuing financial instruments is set out in the financial review on page 26. b Liquidity The maturity of all financial liabilities classified according to facility renewal dates is shown in the following table: Debt other Debt other than finance than finance Finance lease Finance lease leases leases obligations obligations Total Total 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m m m Financial liabilities maturing in one year or less or on demand 42.4 96.4 1.0 2.3 43.4 98.7 in more than one year but not more than two years 30.0 0.3 0.4 0.3 30.4 in more than two years but not more than five years 108.3 15.1 108.3 15.1 in more than five years 30.0 52.3 30.0 52.3 180.7 193.8 1.3 2.7 182.0 196.5 Undrawn borrowing facilities are available to the Group with the maturities set out in the following table: 2004 2003 m m Undrawn borrowing facilities expiring in one year or less 5.6 in more than one year but not more than two years 79.6 in more than two years 100.6 42.2 100.6 127.4 The conditions precedent to the availability of these facilities are all satisfied at the balance sheet date.
