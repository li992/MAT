NOTE OF GROUP HISTORICAL COST PROFITS AND LOSSES For the year ended 31 December 2004 There is no material difference between the result as disclosed in the profit and loss account and the result on an unmodified historical cost basis for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.
RECONCILIATION OF MOVEMENTS IN GROUP EQUITY SHAREHOLDERS FUNDS For the year ended 31 December 2004 2004 2003 Note m m Profit for the financial year 44.4 42.7 Dividends 12 41.3 35.1 Exchange differences on foreign currency net investments 27 27.3 25.9 Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings 27 29.8 27.9 Tax on exchange differences on foreign currency net investments 27 4.1 0.8 New share capital issued for cash 2.5 0.4 Net reduction in own shares 0.1 0.5 Net addition to shareholders funds 4.1 11.3 Equity shareholders funds at 1 January 259.5 248.2 Equity shareholders funds at 31 December 263.6 259.5 Restated for change in revenue recognition and accounting policy for own shares see note 1.
Shareholders funds at 1 January 2004 were originally 268.9m before deducting prior year adjustments of 4.2m for a change in the revenue recognition accounting policy and 5.2m for a change in accounting policy for own shares.
53 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Change in accounting policies Own shares UITF38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, has been adopted with effect from 1 January 2004.
The adjusted accounting policy is that shares held in respect of employee benefit trusts should be deducted from shareholders funds.
Prior to 1 January 2004 these shares were held as fixed asset investments.
The prior year comparatives have been restated to comply with UITF 38, resulting in a reduction to the net book value of investments and reserves of 5.2m at 31 December 2003 and 5.7m at 1 January 2003.
Revenue recognition In accordance with FRS18, Accounting Policies the Groups accounting policies are reviewed regularly and changed when a new policy becomes more appropriate.
Under the previous revenue accounting policy, the Group accounted for tickets sold in advance and for return journeys on a cash basis, with the exception of season tickets in the UK Trains division which were recognised evenly over the life of the season ticket.
Following improvements in the Groups information systems we are now able to reliably measure the deferred revenue adjustment required in relation to these tickets, and therefore a change in accounting policy is appropriate.
The prior year comparatives have been restated for the change in revenue recognition resulting in an additional 5.9m recognised as deferred income at 31 December 2003, and a 1.7m reduction in the corporation tax liability.
After a reduction in turnover and operating profit of 0.4m, and a reduction in the tax charge of 0.1m, the net effect is to reduce the Groups profit after tax by 0.3m from 42.0m to 41.7m in the year to 31 December 2003.
Basic earnings per share has been decreased by 0.2p to 31.9p.
There was no impact on the prior year comparatives for the Company.
The Groups profit after tax for the current year has been reduced by 0.5m as a result of this change in revenue recognition comprising a 0.7m reduction in turnover and operating profit and a 0.2m reduction in the tax charge.
Net assets and reserves have been reduced by 4.2m at 31 December 2003 and 3.9m at 1 January 2003.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of National Express Group PLC and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
No profit and loss account is presented for National Express Group PLC as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
On acquisition of a business, the acquisition method of accounting is adopted, and the Group profit and loss account includes the results of subsidiary and business undertakings purchased during the year from the date of acquisition.
Purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
On the sale of a business, the Group profit and loss account includes the results of that business to the date of disposal.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associates.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of these associates results and reserves based on their latest accounts.
Turnover Turnover of the Group comprises revenue from road passenger transport, train passenger services, airport operations and related activities in the UK, North America and Australia.
Where appropriate, amounts are shown net of rebates and sales tax.
UK Trains turnover includes agreed amounts attributed to the train operating companies TOCs, based principally on models of route usage, by Railway Settlement Plan Limited in respect of passenger receipts.
In addition, franchise agreement receipts from the Strategic Rail Authority SRA and local Passenger Transport Executives PTEs within the West Midlands regions and Scotland are treated as turnover.
Franchise agreement payments to the SRA are recognised in operating costs.
UK Bus, UK Coach and Australia Bus turnover comprise amounts receivable generated from ticket sales.
For UK Bus, UK Coach, UK Trains and Australia Bus, the attributable share of season ticket or travelcard income is deferred within creditors and released to the profit and loss account over the life of the relevant season ticket or travelcard.
North American Bus revenue from local authorities and similar contracts is recognised as the services are provided.
54 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Goodwill In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 10, Goodwill and intangible assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 January 1998 is capitalised within intangible fixed assets and amortised over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years or the life of the rail franchise, if shorter.
Goodwill in respect of acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been set off directly against reserves.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
Fair value adjustments based on provisional estimates are amended in the following years accounts where necessary, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, in order to refine adjustments to reflect further evidence gained post acquisition.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
If a subsidiary, associate or business is subsequently sold or closed, any goodwill arising on acquisition that was written off directly to reserves or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale or closure.
Leased assets Assets held under hire purchase contracts and finance leases, which are those leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital element of future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Stock Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value after making due allowance for obsolete or slow moving items.
Tangible fixed assets Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Short leasehold properties over the period of the lease Long leasehold properties 15 to 40 years Freehold buildings 30 to 50 years Infrastructure assets 10 to 14 years Public service vehicles 2 to 15 years Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years The carrying value of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The Group has followed the transitional provisions in FRS 15, Tangible Fixed Assets, and will not revalue properties in the future, although as permitted by the standard, properties that have been revalued in the past have been retained at their existing book value.
The last valuation was at 31 December 1995.
Government Grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are capitalised and released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic life of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is expensed.
Pension costs Pension costs are recognised on a systematic basis so that the costs of providing retirement benefits to employees are evenly matched, so far as is possible, to the service lives of the employees concerned.
Any excess or deficiency of the actuarial value of assets over the actuarial value of liabilities of the pension scheme is allocated over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Differences between the amount charged in the profit and loss account and payments made to schemes are treated as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all material timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not in that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
55 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs associated with securing new rail franchises are expensed as incurred, except where it is virtually certain that a franchise will be awarded, in which case they are recognised as an asset and are expensed to the profit and loss account over the life of the franchise.
Costs associated with the commencement of all new contracts other than rail franchises are expensed as incurred.
Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses the Group purchases insurance cover from a selection of proven and financially strong insurers.
These insurance policies provide individual claim cover subject to excess limits and aggregate stop losses for total claims within the excess limits.
A provision is made on a discounted basis for the estimated cost to the Group to settle claims for incidents occurring prior to the balance sheet date, subject to the overall stop loss.
Foreign currencies Group The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange for the year.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange differences arising are taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises.
These are taken directly to reserves.
Company Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end except where forward cover has been arranged, in which case the forward rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences arising on the translation of foreign currency equity investments, and on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are used to finance or provide a hedge against these investments.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge interest rate exposures and fuel swaps to hedge fuel price exposures.
The Group considers that these derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when certain criteria are met.
The Groups criteria for these swaps are that the instrument must be related to an asset, liability or future obligation and it must change the character of the interest rate or fuel price by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Differentials are recognised by accruing the net interest or fuel cost payable.
These swaps are not revalued to fair value or included in the Group balance sheet at the year end.
2 CHANGE IN SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS CLASSIFICATION A number of changes have been made to the Groups segmental analysis as follows: a The costs incurred in bidding for franchises in our UK Trains division are now classified as operating costs.
These costs were previously classified as operating exceptional items.
The change in classification aligns our reporting with the majority of our sector peer group.
b Costs and assets incurred and utilised in operating the Group management function are now disclosed separately as Central functions.
These were previously allocated across the Divisions.
The change in classification is intended to align our external reporting with the Groups internal management reporting.
c Restatement of comparatives following the amendment to the revenue recognition accounting policy as set out in note 1. d Removal of own shares from net assets following the adoption of UITF 38 as set out in note 1, and change to net assets following the change in the revenue recognition accounting policy as set out in note 1.

57 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 4 TURNOVER AND SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Due to the nature of the Groups businesses, the origin and destination of turnover is the same.
During the year, franchise agreement receipts from the SRA and PTEs amounted to 497.0m 2003: 684.0m in UK Trains.
The goodwill and tangible fixed asset impairment charges for 2004 relate to the Bosnjak Group, comprising Westbus Pty Limited, Glenorie Bus Company Pty Limited and Westbus UK Limited.
Exceptional items are included within operating costs in note 6 and are analysed as follows: 2004 2003 m m UK Bus Reorganisation 0.4 UK Trains Reorganisation 7.2 North America Reorganisation 0.3 Total exceptional items 7.9 The exceptional costs in UK Trains were incurred at one integration of the three legacy TOCs resulted in restructuring and redundancy charges Qjump redundancy, property and pension charges following the merger and Maintrain redundancy costs incurred as a result of the decision to cease tendering for external work and focus on improving service to Central Trains and Midland Mainline.
The balance of exceptional items comprises the cost of reorganisations at UK Bus 0.4m and North America 0.3m.
Unallocated net liabilities comprise other investments, net borrowings other than finance leases, deferred consideration payable, dividends payable and taxation.

The train operating companies have contracts with Network Rail Infrastructure Limited for access to the railway infrastructure tracks, stations and depots.
The reduction in fixed track access charges arises from the Rail Regulator review.
The train operating companies also have contracts under which rolling stock is leased.
The capital element of the rolling stock lease charge is based on the purchase price, capital funded refurbishments and modifications, and the non-capital element of the lease charges includes heavy maintenance charges, risk and charges based on mileage.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on the sale of property where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
The total amount unprovided is 5.4m 2003: 5.4m.
Such tax would become payable only if the property was sold without it being possible to claim further rollover relief and this is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
In the overseas subsidiaries, the potential deferred tax assets exceed the deferred tax liabilities.
There is no recognition of the deferred tax asset in relation to the excess on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence to determine that it is recoverable.
Deferred tax assets that the Group has not recognised in the accounts amount to 36.4m 2003: 24.8m.
1 1 PROFIT ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHAREHOLDERS OF THE PARENT COMPANY The profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company was 51.1m 2003: 77.3m.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year of 44.4m 2003: 42.7m by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue in the year, excluding those held by employees share ownership trusts which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
61 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 13 EARNINGS PER SHARE continued The reconciliation of weighted average number of ordinary shares is detailed as follows: Number Number of shares of shares 2004 2003 Basic weighted average shares 136,166,921 133,765,928 Adjustment for dilutive potential ordinary shares 2,066,108 3,951,354 Diluted weighted average shares 138,233,029 137,717,282 The normalised basic and normalised diluted earnings per share have been calculated in addition to the basic and diluted earnings per shares required by FRS 14 since, in the opinion of the Directors, they reflect the financial performance of the core business more appropriately.
