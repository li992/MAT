Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments, and are in accordance with section 230 of, and schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985 the Act and with applicable accounting standards and the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP, Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in January 2003.
The financial statements have been prepared on a break-up basis reflecting the likelihood that the Company will be put into liquidation after the second Extraordinary General Meeting convened for 20 September 2004.
All listed investments have been stated at their residual values.
ii Basis of consolidation The Group accounts comprise the audited accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertaking drawn up to the balance sheet date.
iii Income Income from equity investments is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Where the Company elects to receive dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the equivalent to the cash dividend is recognised as income in the revenue statement and any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserve realised.
Interest income is accounted for on an accruals basis.
iv Expenditure and finance costs Expenses and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by accruing the interest on the same basis as the underlying instrument.
The investment management fee and finance costs are charged 25% to the revenue statement and 75% to capital reserve realised, in line with the Boards expected long-term split of returns, in the form of income and capital gains respectively, from the investment portfolio of the Company.
v Profits and losses in subsidiary undertaking Profits and losses arising from investment dealing are dealt with in the revenue statement.
vi Foreign currency translation All transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into Sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Exchange differences arising on the revaluation of investments held as fixed assets are included in capital reserve unrealised.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities are taken to capital reserve realised: such differences in the subsidiary undertaking are taken to the revenue statement.
vii Taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results, as stated in the financial statements, which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
viii Investments Listed investments are valued at their residual values, being closing middle-market prices on recognised stock exchanges ruling on the balance sheet date.
The subsidiary undertaking is carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value in the Companys balance sheet.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors taking account of cost, latest dealing price, professional valuations and other available accounting information as appropriate.

After claiming relief against accrued income taxable on receipt, the Company has unrelieved tax losses of 19,090,793 2003: 14,736,047.
It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise this deficit and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
Furthermore, the Company does not have any unprovided deferred tax liabilities.

Derivatives and other financial instruments Background The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations, for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement and debtors for accrued income.
The numerical disclosures below exclude short term debtors and creditors.
The Group has little exposure to credit and cash flow risk.
Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
This risk is taken into account by the directors when arriving at their valuation of these holdings.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: market price risk, i. e. movements in the value of investment holdings caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movements: foreign currency risk: interest rate risk: and use of derivatives.
The Investment Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
Policy i Market price risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Further information on the investment portfolio and investment policy is set out in the Investment Managers report.
ii Foreign currency risk The Groups portfolio is invested primarily in European securities and their Sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of the investment portfolio, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
34 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Policy continued iii Interest rate risk The principal interest rate risk facing the Group is in respect of its Floating Rate Notes.
This risk has been substantially hedged by entering into interest rate swap contracts see below.
The Floating Rate Notes were repaid in full on 28 May 2004. iv Use of derivatives It is not the Groups policy to enter into derivative contracts other than for the purposes of hedging against movements in the value of the portfolio or its constituents or interest rate exposures.
No derivative contracts were entered into by the Group during the year ended 31 March 2004.
Financial assets Financial assets are included in the balance sheet at mid-market values, which represent fair values.
The currency denomination of the Groups investment portfolio is set out below.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the Companys investment portfolio and the subsidiary undertakings investments.
Financial liabilities The Groups principal financial liability at 31 March 2004 is represented by 75,000,000 nominal of Floating Rate Notes 2003: 75,000,000.
The Notes were repaid in full on 28 May 2004.
The interest rate on the Notes is set quarterly, based upon three months LIBOR plus 0.25% per annum.
The interest rate payable on the Notes at the year end was 4.23% per annum 2003: 3.93%.
Interest rate swaps The Group has entered into interest rate swap agreements to fix substantially the interest rate cost of the Floating Rate Notes.
At 31 March 2004 the Group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements with a notional principal value of 68,100,000 2003: 68,100,000 maturing on 31 August 2004.
The weighted average rate of interest applicable to these agreements is 7.56% per annum.
At the year end the swaps had a negative fair value of 854,000 2003: 3,909,000 and their book value was nil.
Merrill Lynch European Investment Trust plc 35 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 16.
