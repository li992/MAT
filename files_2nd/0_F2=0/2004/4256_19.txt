applications and the method of designing things using GSM standard sampling: the process of shipping small quantities of a new a computer IC to a customer in order to allow the customer to test the IC host software: software running on the system in which the CMOS: Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor technology: in its product device is embedded a semiconductor process technology that uses planar transistors semiconductor: a material, typically crystalline, that can be IC or integrated circuit: a semiconductor device consisting of to make chips that consume relatively low power and permit a altered to allow electrical current to flow or not flow in a pattern: many thousands or millions of interconnected transistors and high level of integration common semiconductors are silicon, germanium and galliumother components CODEC: an acronym for coder decoder: codecs are integrated arsenide and the term is also used to apply to ICs made from IEEE: Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers circuits or chips that include analogue-to-digital conversion and these materials digital-to-analogue conversion on a single chip ISO: International Standards Organisation: the international silicon: a semiconducting material used to make wafers, widely organisation responsible for developing and maintaining chip: short for a microchip: semiconductor device or used in the semiconductor industry as the basic material for worldwide standards for manufacturing, environmental integrated circuit integrated circuits protection, computers, data communications, and many communications protocol stack: communications software, short range: Bluetooth is principally used for communicating other fields which is required, together with the baseband processor and over ranges of up to 10 metres ISO 9000: a series of international standards for quality other subsystems, to implement a wireless communications software stack: software required to implement the assurance in business practices, ratified by the ISO beginning in standard Bluetooth standard 1987.
Certification of ISO 9000 compliance is important for CSP: Chip-Scale Package: a semiconductor package which is as selling many types of goods and services including datatransistor: the basic building block of modern semiconductor small as the semiconductor chip and is used for small firm factor communications equipment and services microelectronics: a transistor regulates current flow or voltage applications such as mobile phones, PDAs and wireless devices internet protocols: the communications protocols used over USB: Universal Serial Bus: an interface between a computer customer applications software: software that is not generic and the Internet and add-on devices which is written to specifically address a customer-defined kbs: 1kbs is a unit of 1024 bits per second UWB: Ultra WideBand, a wireless technology for transmitting problem or task large amounts of digital data over a wide spectrum of frequency LEDs: Light Emitting Diode: a semiconductor device that emits DSP: Digital Signal Processor: a device which enables computer bands with very low power for a short distance visible light when electrical power is supplied to it manipulation using processing elements or stored programs of WiFi: WiFi short for wireless fidelity also known as IEEE analogue signals which have been sampled and converted to Mb or Mega Byte: 1024 times 1024 bytes where 1 byte is equal 802.11a b g is an 11-55 Mbs raw radio bit rate data centric digital form to 8 bits wireless communication standard mainly used today for wireless design win: CSR records a design win when a product using one memory: any device that can store data in machine-readable computer networks at home and in the office of its ICs becomes Bluetooth qualified format which may include RAM, ROM and Flash wafer: a disc made of a semiconducting material such as silicon, die: another word for chip: often used to refer to the chips whilst microcontroller: often defined as being a microprocessor usually between 150mm 6 and 300mm 12 in diameter, in they are still an integral part of the silicon wafer or where they together with its memory and a means of allowing input which integrated circuits are manufactured: a wafer may contain have been cut from the wafer but are, as yet, unpackaged and output several thousand individual integrated circuits digital: the representation of data by a series of bits or discrete microprocessor: a computer with its entire CPU contained on yield: when used in connection with manufacturing, the ratio of values such as 0s and 1s one integrated circuit the number of usable products to the total number of products dongle: an electronic device that is usually plugged into the USB motherboard: the principal printed circuit board embedded on a wafer port of a computer in order to provide added functionality within an electronic product 64 Changing the way the world connects CSRs offices United Kingdom Sweden Churchill House CSR Sweden AB Cambridge Business Park Emdalav.
