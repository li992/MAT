The Groups share of the net assets of the Associate is shown on the balance sheet under non-current assets as a single line.
The results of the associate appear in two lines in the profit and loss account.
The Groups share of the profit before tax of the associate appears on the face of the profit and loss account.
The Groups share of the associates tax charge appears in the tax note.
Joint Venture JV JVs are arrangements where the partners share in the profits of the JV operations.
JVs are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The Groups share of the gross assets and gross liabilities of the JV are shown as two lines on the face of the balance sheet within non-current assets.
Treatment in the profit and loss account is similar to associated undertakings except that turnover is grossed up for the Groups share of the turnover of the JV, which is then deducted on the face of the P&L to arrive at Group turnover.
JANE Joint arrangements not creating an entity JANE are characterised by the sharing of output eg, the physical commodity or a transport facility rather than the sharing of profit from operations of the JV.
JANES are proportionately consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Subsidiary Subsidiaries are 100% consolidated on a line-by-line basis.
Where a subsidiary is not 100% owned, the minority interests share of net assets and profits are deducted on the face of the balance sheet and profit and loss account as single lines.
