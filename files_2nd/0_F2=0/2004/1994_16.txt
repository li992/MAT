Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the parent Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Goodwill With effect from 1 April 1998, where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment reviews or an annual amortisation charge will be determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 is not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet.
When a business is disposed of, goodwill, where applicable, is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account.
Joint ventures The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
Turnover Turnover represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year.
On traditional developments, properties are treated as sold and profits are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
On complex multi-unit developments, revenue and profit are recognised on a staged basis, commencing when the building work is substantially complete, which is dened as being plastered and when contracts are exchanged.
Tangible xed assets Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost of the assets over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and ttings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% Leasehold property is amortised over the period of the lease.
Computer equipment is included within xtures and ttings.
Stocks Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of direct cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Progress payments are deducted from work in progress.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not been reversed by the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable and have not been discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet dates.
Financial instruments From time to time the Group makes use of interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to uctuations in interest rates.
Interest rate instruments are treated as hedges and the net interest payable or receivable is reected in the profit and loss account.
Pension costs The expected cost of providing pensions on dened benefit schemes is recognised on a systematic basis over the period during which benefit is derived from the employees services.
Pension contributions under dened contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Leasing and rental agreements Payments under rental and operating lease agreements are charged against profit in the periods in which they become due.
co. uk 1 Accounting policies continued Long term executive incentive schemes and plan Provision is made to match the cost of shares provisionally allocated in respect of any year to participants under the Groups long term executive incentive schemes and plan.

co. uk 5 Directors and employees continued The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2001.
The method adopted in the 2001 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment prior to and after retirement of 6.5% and 5.5% per annum respectively, pension increases for service before and after April 1997 of 3.0% and 2.5% per annum respectively and salary escalation at 3.5% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2001 was 13,956,000 and was sufficient to cover 79% of the schemes liabilities.
Based on that valuation, employers contributions are currently paid at 15% and it is proposed to maintain this level of contribution thereby reducing the deficit to zero over the expected remaining service life of existing members.
In addition there is an accrual at 30 April 2004 of 1,525,000 2003: 1,000,000 resulting from the difference in the amounts charged to the profit and loss account and the amounts paid to the scheme.
A new valuation is currently being carried out as at 1 May 2004.
Contributions amounting to 1,538,000 2003: 1,356,000 were paid into the dened contribution schemes during the year, representing the appropriate level of dened funding.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benets, the required disclosures relating to the Berkeley Final Salary Plan are set out below.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 May 2001, and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 30 April 2004.

b Transaction with Crosby Executive Team On 28 August 2003, the Company announced that it had entered into an agreement whereby the Crosby Executive Team led by Geoff Hutchinson subscribed for new shares in The Crosby Group plc Crosby.
Broadly, these shares are entitled to 50.01% of the economic and voting rights of Crosby after the generation of 450 million of operating cashow.
Until this time, Berkeley will remain in control of Crosby and therefore will continue to consolidate Crosby as a subsidiary.
Thereafter, Berkeley will retain 49.99% of the shareholding.
Geoff Hutchinson was a Main Board Director of Berkeley until his resignation on 27 August 2003, the day prior to the announcement of the transaction.
The full Crosby Executive team comprises Geoff Hutchinson, Richard Starkey, Andrew Brady, Andrew Jinks and Keith Pepperdine, all of whom are directors of companies within the Crosby Group.
The transaction was approved unanimously by the Main Board other than Geoff Hutchinson who did not participate in the Boards discussion in view of his interest in the acquisition.
To effect this transaction, the Executive Team subscribed for B shares in Crosby, representing fair value, for a consideration of 500,000, funded by a loan, on commercial terms, from Berkeley.
This is reected as a minority interest in these financial statements.
These shares carry dividend and voting rights if Crosby makes agreed milestone payments to Berkeley every six months and generates overall 450 million of operating cashow within seven years.
Unless both of these requirements are met the B shares will receive no dividends or voting rights and, consequently, Berkeley will not cede control.
This 450 million will be realised from the capital employed in Crosby which at 30 April 2003 was 253.7 million and comprised an inter-company loan of 215.9 million and shareholders funds of 37.8 million.
Until this time, Berkeley will remain in control of Crosby and, therefore, it will continue to be consolidated.
Upon completion of the principal terms and conditions of the transaction, control will pass to the Executive Team and Crosby will then cease to be consolidated and Berkeley will instead equity account for its shareholding.
It has also been agreed between the parties that, in addition to the conditions above, economic or voting control will not pass unless the gross assets of Crosby at the time control passes are less than 75 million and the net assets are less than 50 million.
On his resignation from the Board of The Berkeley Group plc, Geoff Hutchinson entered into a new service agreement with Crosby and remains its Chairman.
He has ceased to benefit from Berkeleys Long Term Incentive Plan.
Under this service agreement, Geoff Hutchinson and the Executive Team will receive 2.3 million if Crosby is acquired by a third party within 364 days from 28 August 2003.
This payment is contingent on Geoff Hutchinson not joining the acquiring company and therefore leaving Berkeley and Crosby.
If Crosby is not acquired within the 364-day period these sums do not become payable.
