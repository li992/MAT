Foreign currency holdings and borrowings An analysis by currency of Group net cash at the year end is as follows:- Net cash Net cash balance at balance at Currency 30th June 30th June 2004 2003 000 000 69,101 Pounds Sterling 69,158 11,836 US Dollar 10,974 9,296 Japanese Yen 3,427 14,230 Euro 15,632 906 Other 1,890 32,833 37,235 The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the deposits and borrowings.
Interest rates are floating and based on libor libid.
Net assets and associated borrowings at the year end were:- As noted in the Operating and financial review on page 12, the Group maintains foreign currency borrowings as a method of providing hedging against the currency translation risk of the net assets of its overseas subsidiaries.
The level of hedging in place at the year end for the major currencies and their relative base borrowing interest rates, were as follows: Currency Currency Base borrowing Net assets of borrowing interest rate subsidiary 000 % 000 US Dollar 15,565 1.25% 16,588 Japanese Yen 10,640 0.1% 10,792 Euro 17,290 2.0% 17,847 The currency borrowings are short-term, with floating interest rates.
In order to minimise the cost of these borrowings, short-term currency swaps are used on a rolling one-month cycle.
These currency swaps are not reflected in the table above.
Foreign currency holdings and borrowings continued Unrecognised gains and losses on currency hedges at the year end:- 000 Unrecognised gains on hedges at 1st July 2003 31 Gains arising in previous years that were recognised in 2004 31 Gains arising in 2004 that were not recognised in the year - Unrecognised gains on hedges at 30th June 2004 - Gains and losses on instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged position matures.
At the year end, there were no unrecognised gains or losses on foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
Short-term debtors and creditors, as defined in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments disclosures, have been omitted from all the financial instruments disclosures, save for those relating to currency risk.
