The deferred tax provision has not been discounted.
iii Factors that may affect future tax charges As a result of deferred and overseas tax, the Group expects its tax charge for the foreseeable future to remain at an effective rate close to the UK Corporation Tax rate of 30%.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised where the likelihood of realisation fails to meet the more likely than not criterion.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
At the year-end the total unprovided deferred tax on assets if sold at book value, including the impact of gains rolled over against these assets, would be 91 million 2003: 58 million.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief and if expenditure on replacement assets were less than anticipated.
However, it is not expected that any capital gain will be crystallised in the foreseeable future.

Pensions a Pensions The Group operates a contracted-out defined benefit scheme, The Greenalls Group Pension & Life Assurance Scheme the Scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme is now closed to new members.
Contributions are paid into the Scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The latest formal triennial actuarial valuation was carried out on 5 April 2003 and this disclosed that the value of the Schemes assets totalled 197 million at market value, which represented 83% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The liabilities were valued on a market-related projected unit basis.
Under this basis the current service cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
Following the disposal of the Pubs & Restaurants business, in December 1999, and based on subsequent advice from the Groups actuaries, the Group undertook to improve the funding level of the Scheme by contributing an additional 40 million to the Scheme payable over a four year period.
The final instalment due under this commitment of 2.5 million was paid on 1 November 2003.
After consultation with the Groups actuaries and the Pension Trustees, the Group has agreed to make additional contributions of 2.8 million per annum from February 2004 over the next thirteen years and this will be reviewed at the next triennial valuation in April 2006.
The additional contributions will be increased annually in line with wage inflation.
The SSAP 24 charge for the year based on best estimate valuation was 2.2 million.
The Group also operates a defined contribution Group Personal Pension Plan for employees in which liabilities are restricted to the level of contributions paid into the Scheme.
