In 2002 the Group entered into an asset securitisation programme in respect of certain of its US trade receivables.
Under the terms of this programme an interest in a pool of debtors is sold to a financial institution in exchange for cash, on which interest is payable.
A security interest has been granted to the bank over the pool which as at 4 January 2005 consisted of 22.5 million 2003: 29.6 million of third party trade debtors against which cash received was 14.3 million 2003: 22.6 million.
These amounts have not been netted off against debtors.
The financial institution does not have recourse to the Group for any receivables that default, and where that default cannot be met from the balance of the pool of debts against which the original loan was made.
The Group is responsible for the eligibility of the receivables that it sells.
In 2003 the Group entered into a non-recourse sale and assignment of receivables within Europe.
As at 4 January 2005 the cash received was 12.0 million.
This has not been netted off against debtors.
