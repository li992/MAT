Accounting policies The following paragraphs describe the main policies: a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in compliance with all applicable accounting standards, the requirements of the Financial Services Authority and, except for the treatment of grants and contributions on infrastructure assets, with the Companies Act 1985.
An explanation of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 is given in note 1 h below.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements include the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, each made up to 31 March 2004, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of joint ventures and associated undertakings on the basis of their latest financial statements.
The results of any undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included for the periods of ownership.
c Turnover Turnover, excluding Value Added Tax, represents the income receivable in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
d Landfill tax Landfill tax is included within both turnover and operating costs.
e Intangible fixed assets and amortisation From 1 April 1998 goodwill arising from the acquisition of subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings, representing the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired, is capitalised and classified as an asset on the balance sheet.
Where goodwill has a finite economic life, it is amortised evenly over that period.
For acquisitions before 1 April 1998 goodwill arising was written off directly to Group reserves.
When a subsidiary, joint venture or associated undertaking is sold, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after including the attributable amount of unamortised goodwill or the goodwill previously written off to Group reserves.
f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation i Infrastructure assets being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls Infrastructure assets comprise a network that, as a whole, is intended to be maintained in perpetuity at a specified level of service by the continuing replacement and refurbishment of its components.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancement of the network, in accordance with defined standards of service and to the maintenance of the operating capacity of the network, is treated as an addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge on infrastructure assets represents the level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capacity of the network and is calculated from an independently certified asset management plan.
Accounting policies continued f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation continued ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of a landfill site is depreciated over its estimated operational life taking account of the usage of void space.
Cost includes acquisition and development expenses.
iii Other assets including properties, overground plant and equipment Other assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated evenly over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Leasehold buildings......................................... Over the period of the lease Freehold buildings........................................... 30-60 years Operational structures...................................... 40-80 years Fixed plant.................................................... 20-40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers.................. 3-10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The cost of assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs that are incremental to the Group.
g Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets at their equivalent capital value and are depreciated over their estimated economic lives or the finance lease period, whichever is the shorter.
The corresponding liability is recorded as a creditor.
The interest element of the rental costs is charged against profits, using the actuarial method, over the period of the lease.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged against profits in the year they are incurred.
h Grants and contributions Grants and contributions receivable in respect of capital expenditure on non-infrastructure assets are included in the balance sheet as deferred income and are released to profits over the depreciable lives of the assets to which they relate.
Grants and contributions receivable relating to infrastructure assets have been deducted from the cost of tangible fixed assets.
This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 is, in the opinion of the Directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view as while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, these assets do not have determinable finite lives and therefore no basis exists on which to recognise grants and contributions as deferred income.
The effect of this treatment on the value of tangible fixed assets is disclosed in note 13.
Grants and contributions receivable in respect of expenditure charged against profits in the year have been included in the profit and loss account.
Pennon Group Plc 35 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies continued i Investments Listed investments held as current assets are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Short-dated unlisted securities held as current assets are stated at cost plus accrued income.
j Fixed asset investment in own shares and impairment Shares acquired under the Employee Share Ownership Plan, a discretionary trust, are recognised on the balance sheet at cost of acquisition less impairment, being the charge to profits over the period to which the employees performance relates.
k Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials and an element of overheads.
l Pension costs The expected cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes is charged against profits so as to spread evenly the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
A pension surplus or deficit is released or charged to profits using the straight line method, over the average remaining service lives of employees in the scheme.
Pension costs for the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged against profits in the year in which they are incurred.
The financial statements reflect, as set out in note 30, only the disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits.
m Research and development expenditure Research and development expenditure is charged against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
n Taxation Tax payable on profits for the year is provided at current rates.
Tax deferred or accelerated as a result of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and for accounting purposes is provided in full.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material the current amount of the reversals of tax deferred is discounted to its present value.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included in the tax charge.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset can be recovered in future periods.
Accounting policies continued o Environmental and landfill restoration costs Provisions for restoration, aftercare and environmental control costs are made when an obligation arises.
Where the obligation recognised as a provision gives access to future economic benefits, a tangible fixed asset is recognised.
Provisions are otherwise charged against profits.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the current amount of the provision is the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle obligations.
The unwinding of the discount to present value is included as a financial item within net interest payable.
p Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge interest rate risks.
All such hedging instruments, including interest differentials which arise, are matched with their underlying hedged item.

Within obligations under finance leases, South West Water Limited has: a utilised finance lease facilities of 180.0 million at 31 March 2004 2003 180.0 million for certain water and sewerage business tangible fixed assets: b deposited amounts, equal to the present value of rental obligations arising from those finance leases, with United Kingdom financial institutions, to counter-indemnify the letters of credit issued by those financial institutions to the lessors in order to secure those rental obligations.
These deposited funds, which totalled 144.9 million at 31 March 2004 2003 144.9 million, together with interest earned thereon, may be used to settle the rental obligations under those finance leases.
If the finance leases terminate due to the insolvency of the financial institutions which have issued the letters of credit, no liability will fall on South West Water, or any Pennon Group company.
The rentals payable under the finance leases will vary if interest rates, or effective tax rates, change.
Loans and other borrowings continued Borrowing facilities Undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 80.0 million were available to the Group at 31 March 2004 which expire as follows: 2004 2003 m m Within one year or less 30.0 Over two years 80.0 80.0 30.0 In addition, the Group has short-term uncommitted bank facilities of 145.0 million.

Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities After taking into account interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities was: Financial assets Financial liabilities 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Floating rate 262.6 187.7 668.5 549.2 Fixed rate 6.1 4.3 673.3 630.4 On which no interest is paid 2.7 0.8 19.6 19.9 271.4 192.8 1,361.4 1,199.5 Which is included in: Net debt 267.7 191.0 1,341.8 1,179.6 Provisions for liabilities and charges 1.3 1.7 Deferred income 18.2 18.2 Other long-term monetary assets liabilities 3.7 1.8 0.1 271.4 192.8 1,361.4 1,199.5 Fixed rate financial assets and liabilities: Weighted average interest rate 6.1% 6.3% 6.5% 6.7% Weighted average period for which rate is fixed 2.6 years 1.1 years 2.8 years 3.9 years Range of interest rates 4.2% to 3.5% to 4.3% to 4.3% to 8.0% 8.0% 11.3% 11.3% Financial assets and liabilities on which no interest is paid: Weighted average period until maturity 14.2 years 15.2 years All financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Pennon Group Plc 53 Notes to the financial statements 27.
Financial instruments continued The floating rate financial assets earn interest, in some cases fixed in advance for periods up to twelve months, based on short term money market rates.
The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, in some cases fixed in advance for periods up to twelve months, related to the London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR or equivalent.
The maturity profile of floating rate and fixed rate financial liabilities is shown in note 26.
Other financial liabilities fall due for payment principally after five years.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage the mix of fixed and floating rates to ensure at least 50% of net debt is at fixed rate: at 31 March 2004 62% of net debt was at fixed rate 2003 63% : at 31 March 2004 interest rate swaps to hedge financial liabilities with a notional principal value of 490.0 million existed with a weighted average maturity of 1.3 years 2003 435.0 million, with 2.2 years to swap from floating to fixed rate: and at 31 March 2004 floating rate interest rate swaps, to hedge financial liabilities with a notional principal value of 200.0 million, existed to swap LIBOR to European Inter Bank Offer Rate EURIBOR with commencement dates between 1 April 2006 and 1 April 2010 and maturing on 31 March 2030 2003 200.0 million.
The settlement of 18.2 million which was received when these swaps were entered into during December 1999 has been deferred note 22 and will be matched with interest charges on the underlying hedged debt over the period of the swaps.
The notional principal amounts of the interest rate swaps are used to determine settlement under those swaps and are not, therefore, an exposure for the Group.
Financial assets and liabilities exclude short term debtors and creditors other than loans and obligations under finance leases falling due within one year.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities Fair values are established at a specific point in time, based on relevant market information and the character of the financial instrument, using estimates that are subjective in nature.
2004 2003 Fair value Book value Fair value Book value Restated m m m m Financial assets: Current asset investments 253.7 253.8 182.4 182.5 Cash at bank 14.0 14.0 8.6 8.6 Other 3.7 3.8 1.8 1.8 271.4 271.6 192.8 192.9 Financial liabilities: Short-term debt 107.0 107.4 96.4 96.2 Long-term debt 1,234.8 1,226.3 1,083.2 1,118.5 Other 1.4 1.4 1.7 1.7 1,343.2 1,335.1 1,181.3 1,216.4 Derivative financial instruments used to manage interest rate profile : Interest rate swaps 18.2 6.1 18.2 16.6 Market values, where available, have been used to determine fair values.
The fair value of floating rate loans and obligations under finance leases have been estimated by discounting cash flows at prevailing rates which is a change to the method previously adopted.
2003 has been restated accordingly from 1,244.7 million to 1,216.4 million.
Other floating rate liabilities, floating rate current asset investments and cash at bank are assumed to have a fair value equal to book value.

On 5 June 2003 the entire issued share capital of Churngold Holdings Limited now renamed Viridor Waste Bristol Holdings Limited was purchased by Viridor Waste Management Limited for a cash consideration of 19.8 million, including costs of 0.1 million.
The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method and provisional goodwill arising on the acquisition amounting to 12.5 million, has been capitalised and will be amortised over 20 years.
The profit after tax of Churngold Holdings Limited amounted to 0.2 million for the period from 1 June 2002 to 4 June 2003.

The provisional revaluation adjustment recognises the value of acquired tangible fixed assets to the Group.
Other adjustments include additional creditors for taxation following a reassessment of the taxation affairs of the company for pre-acquisition periods.
The acquisition of Terry Adams Limited on 12 December 1997 provided for contingent consideration with a maximum of 28.0 million, linked to planning approval of landfill sites, which was not included in the acquisition cost.
At 31 March 2003, 14.5 million remained as contingently payable.
During the year, 3.7 million of that contingent consideration was settled through the issue of loan stock notes note 26.
The fair value to the Group of the landfill acquired, based on projected discounted cash flows, amounted to 0.4 million.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition amounting to 3.3 million has been written off to Group reserves.

Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes including a defined contribution section within the main scheme.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The latest actuarial valuation of the main scheme was as at 31 March 2001.
At that date the market value of the schemes assets was 215.1 million and this was sufficient to cover 109% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
The valuation assumed that the investment return would be 5.75% per annum for past service and 6.75% per annum for future service, pensionable pay increases would average 3.5% per annum and that present and future pensions would both increase at a rate of 2.5% per annum.
The pension cost of the main defined benefit scheme has been determined on the advice of the independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The employers regular pension cost for the year was 11.5% of pensionable earnings 2003 11.5%.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 March 2004 for the main scheme was 5.6 million 2003 3.1 million reflecting the advice of the independent qualified actuary to increase employers contributions to 11.5% 2003 4.8% of pensionable earnings.
Pension prepayments included as debtors of the Group amount to 4.6 million 2003 5.5 million, representing the accumulated difference between the Group pension cost and employer contributions paid.
The Group accounts for pension benefits in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 was originally intended to change the basis of accounting for pension benefits from 2003 04 but full implementation has been deferred.
Under transitional arrangements applying to FRS 17, certain additional disclosures are still required and these are given below.
The full actuarial valuation at 31 March 2001 was updated at 31 March 2004 by the independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method, as required by FRS 17.
The value of the assets of the schemes has been updated to market value as at 31 March 2004.
The demographic assumptions used in calculating the scheme liabilities under FRS 17 remain unchanged from those used in the 31 March 2001 actuarial valuation.
The financial assumptions at each year end under FRS 17 were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Rate of increase in pensionable pay 3.70 3.50 3.75 Rate of increase for present and future pensions 2.70 2.50 2.75 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.50 5.50 6.00 Inflation 2.70 2.50 2.75 The assets in the schemes and the expected long term rate of return at the year end were: 2004 2003 2002 Return Value Return Value Return Value %m % m % m Equities 7.70 154.6 7.00 119.0 7.75 151.6 Bonds 4.70 38.2 4.50 31.9 5.25 42.5 Other 4.30 8.4 3.50 8.4 5.00 15.6 Total market value of assets 201.2 159.3 209.7 Present value of schemes liabilities 278.4 244.2 216.8 Deficit in schemes 77.2 84.9 7.1 Related deferred tax asset 23.2 25.5 2.1 Net pension liabilities 54.0 59.4 5.0 58 Pennon Group Plc 30.
