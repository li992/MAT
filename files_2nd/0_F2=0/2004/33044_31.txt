Adams is a branded global confectionery manufacturer of gum and medicated sweets.
The intangible that arose on this acquisition was 2,435 million and this has been split between brands 1,004 million, and goodwill 1,431 million.
The acquisition of Adams was a major strategic step for Cadbury Schweppes for the following reasons: The Group has scale presence across the entire confectionery market chocolate, sugar and gum Adams has increased the Groups exposure significantly to higher growth categories Adams has given the Group strong positions and routes to market in new geographies notably in the US and Latin America The acquisition provides significant value creation opportunities.
During 2003 the Group also acquired The Natural Confectionery Company, an Australian confectionery company as well as two smaller acquisitions for a combined total consideration of 44 million.
Goodwill of 38 million arose on these acquisitions.
All transactions in the year have been treated as acquisitions for accounting purposes.
Adams disclosures From the date of the acquisition to 28 December 2003, Adams contributed 865 million to turnover, 95 million to underlying operating profit operating profit before exceptional restructuring costs, and goodwill intangibles amortisation, and 1 million loss before exceptional restructuring costs, and goodwill intangibles amortisation, but after interest.
Adams contributed 153 million to the Groups cash flow from operating activities, paid 2 million in respect of interest, 19 million in respect of taxation and spent 35 million on capital expenditure.
An amount of 70 million has been charged as exceptional restructuring costs in respect of costs incurred in reorganising, restructuring and integrating Adams in the period from 30 March 2003 to 28 December 2003.
The goodwill arising on the Adams acquisitions in the USA, Canada, Japan and the UK is deductable for tax purposes.
In its last financial year to 31 December 2002, Adams unaudited estimated profit after tax and minority interest was 93 million.
For the period since 31 December 2002, to the date of acquisition, Adams unaudited results were estimated to be: m Turnover 248 Operating Costs 231 Operating Profit 17 The Adams acquisition involved the purchase of a division of Pfizer Inc.
This involved the acquisition of operations in over 35 countries and these were a mixture of share and asset purchases.
It is therefore not possible to allocate any items below operating profit to the Adams management accounts for this period.
The statement of total recognised gains and losses for the nine months to December 2003 for Adams is as follows: m Loss for the Financial Period 48 Net currency translation differences 262 Total recognised gains and losses relating to the period 310 Not included in the table above are exchange gains on the borrowings used to finance Adams of 194 million.

Therefore included in the above table is a net adjustment of 5 million relating to these adjustments which decreased goodwill on acquisition.
Of the provisional fair value adjustments noted above the principal adjustments noted were: The value of brands acquired with the acquisitions in the year have been recognised as a separate intangible fixed asset.
The Group has also completed the valuation of intangible arising from some 2002 acquisitions mainly Dandy.
This has led to a net reclassification of 80 million from goodwill to intangible fixed assets.
Tangible fixed assets have been revalued to reflect the market value of the principal acquired production facilities.
As part of the Adams acquisition the assets and liabilities relating to the defined benefit pension obligations of Adams employees have been transferred to the Group.
Provision has been made for the actuarial calculation of the net pension deficit that existed at the date of the transaction.
Additionally provisions have been made for certain onerous lease commitments and inherent severance payments to senior management.
Certain liabilities of the acquired business are incapable of accurate calculation until the Group receives notification of the vendors decisions under options within the sale agreement.
In addition, the period by which certain employees of the acquired Group have to decide whether to transfer pension benefits across to the Group has not yet expired.
Due to these reasons and given the global scale of the Adams transaction, the related fair values are stated on a provisional basis.
