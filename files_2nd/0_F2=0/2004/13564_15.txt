Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Cash at bank and in hand, short-term deposits and short-term borrowings: The book value approximates to fair value either due to the short-term maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate of investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.
Derivatives: The fair value of derivatives is the estimated amount, based on current market rates, which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the derivatives at the balance sheet date.
Hedges of future transactions As described in the Finance Directors review on pages 26 to 31 the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest swaps Currency exposures on future forecast sales using forward foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and currency options Commodity price risk using jet fuel swaps Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are dealt with as outlined in the accounting policies on pages 57 and 58.

Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, the special share may be redeemed by the Treasury Solicitor at par at any time.
The special share confers no rights to dividends or to vote at general meetings but in the event of a winding-up it shall be repaid at its nominal value in priority to any other shares.
During the year, the Groups B Share scheme for the purpose of making payments to shareholders, received approval at the Annual General Meeting AGM, and in June 83,922,435,550 non-cumulative redeemable convertible preference B shares of 0.1p were issued.
Shareholders are able to redeem any number of their B Shares for cash or convert them into ordinary shares.
B Shares retained, attract a dividend of 75% of LIBOR on the 0.1p nominal value of each share, paid on a semi-annual basis, and have limited voting rights.
In certain circumstances the Company will have the option to redeem the B Shares.
This option can be exercised at any time if the aggregate number of B Shares in issue is less than 10% of the aggregate number of B Shares issued, or on the acquisition or capital restructuring of the Company.
On a return of capital on a winding-up, the holders of B Shares shall be entitled, in priority to any payment to the holders of ordinary shares, to the repayment of the nominal capital paid up or credited as paid-up on the B Shares held by them, together with a sum equal to the outstanding preferential dividend which will have accrued but not been paid until the date of return of capital.
The redemption and conversion of B Shares shown in the above table took place on or as soon as possible after July 5, 2004, for shareholders who made an election on or before June 18, 2004.
Future redemption and conversion opportunities are expected to be made available for holders of B Shares.
Under the terms of the sharesave schemes, the Board may grant options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company each year to those employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE contract for a period of either three, five or seven years.
Employees in 28 countries participate in sharesave schemes through arrangements broadly comparable to the UK scheme.

1 The Group has adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts which requires own shares to be reclassied within shareholders funds.
Amounts relating to own shares have been included in the profit and loss account reserve.
Ordinary shares in the Company are held in two trusts: i In respect of employee share schemes.
The shares held by this independently managed trust were purchased on the open market: m May 5, 2004 37,130 at 1.95 per share 0.1 October 22, 2004 400,000 at 1.98 per share 0.8 At December 31, 2004, the shares held had a market value of 1.1m.
In accordance with UITF 17 Employee share schemes, the Group is required to amortise the cost of likely awards over each separate performance measurement period and to include this charge as part of the cost of wages and salaries.
The UITF is a committee of the Accounting Standards Board.
ii In respect of a Qualifying Employee Share Trust QUEST, which provides employees with shares under Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE share schemes.
As permitted by UITF 17, no amortisation charge has been made.
At December 31, 2004, a total of 410,747 of these shares had still not been allocated to option holders, their market value being 1.0m.
These outstanding allocations are expected to occur in 2005.
Both trusts have waived their voting rights, and their costs of administration have been charged to the Groups profit and loss account.
2 A dividend of 601m was received on December 21, 2004 from a subsidiary company, Rolls-Royce plc.
Of this amount, 550m is separately identied in the Companys accounting records.
76 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Operating lease annual commitments 2004 2003 m m Leases of land and buildings which expire: Within one year 2 2 Between one and five years 4 3 After five years 10 9 Other leases which expire: Within one year 2 4 Between one and five years 21 7 After five years 35 42 28 Contingent liabilities In connection with the sale of its products, on some occasions the Group enters into individually and collectively significant long-term contingent obligations.
These can involve, inter alia, guaranteeing nancing for customers, guaranteeing a proportion of the values of both engine and airframe, entering into leasing transactions, commitments to purchase aircraft and in certain circumstances could involve the Group assuming certain of its customers entitlements and related borrowing or cash ow obligations until the value of the security can be realised.
At the date these accounts are approved, the directors regard the possibility that there will be any significant loss arising from these contingencies, which cover a number of customers over a long period of time, as remote.
In determining this, and the values below, the directors have taken account of advice, principally from Airclaims Limited, professional aircraft appraisers, who base their calculations on a current and future fair market value basis assuming an arms-length transaction between a willing seller and a willing buyer.
At December 31, 2004, the total gross contingent liabilities relating to nancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft less insurance arrangements and relevant provisions amounted to 999m 2003 1,090m, of which 12m 2003 39m related to sales finance support to joint ventures.
Taking into account the net realisable value of the relevant security, the net contingent liabilities in respect of nancing arrangements on all delivered aircraft amounted to 189m 2003 184m.
Sensitivity calculations are complex, but, for example, if the value of the relevant security was reduced by 20%, a net contingent liability of approximately 277m 2003 262m would result.
There are also net contingent liabilities in respect of undelivered aircraft but it is not considered practicable to estimate these as deliveries can be many years in the future and the related nancing will only be put in place at the appropriate time.
Contingent liabilities exist in respect of guarantees provided by the Group in the ordinary course of business for product delivery, performance and reliability.
The Company and some of its subsidiary undertakings have, in the normal course of business, entered into arrangements in respect of export finance, performance bonds, countertrade obligations and minor miscellaneous items.
Various Group undertakings are parties to legal actions and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business, some of which are for substantial amounts.
As a consequence of the insolvency of an insurer as previously reported, the Group is no longer fully insured against known and potential claims from employees who worked for certain of the Groups UK based businesses for a period prior to the acquisition of those businesses by the Group.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not expect any of these arrangements, legal actions or claims, after allowing for provisions already made, to result in significant loss to the Group or Company.
In addition to the above, the Company has provided guarantees in respect of borrowings of subsidiary undertakings as shown in notes 18 and 20.
29 Related party transactions Joint ventures In the course of normal operations, the Group has contracted on an arms-length basis with joint ventures.
The aggregated transactions which are considered to be material and which have not been disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements are summarised below: 2004 2003 m m Other income 15 9 Purchases of goods and services from joint ventures 437 682 77 Rolls-Royce Group plc Annual report 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Post-retirement benets Pensions The Groups pension schemes are mainly of the dened benefit type and the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The pension cost relating to the UK schemes is assessed in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, based on the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuations of the principal schemes were as at March 31, 2004 for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme, April 5, 2004 for the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme, and March 31, 2003 for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund.
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of SSAP 24, were that in the long term the average returns on investments would be 2% per annum higher than the average increase in pay and 3.6% per annum higher than the average increase in pensions.
Assets were valued on a market related basis for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme and the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme and on an actuarial basis for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund.
The pension cost relating to overseas schemes is calculated in accordance with local best practice and regulations.
The total pension cost for the Group was 123m 2003 95m of which 25m 2003 23m relates to overseas schemes.
The aggregate of the market values of the UK schemes at the dates of the latest actuarial valuations was 3,804m.
The actuarial value of the assets of the principal schemes represented respectively 92% for the Rolls-Royce Pension Fund, 79% for the Vickers Group Pension Scheme and 89% for the Rolls-Royce Group Pension Scheme of the value of the projected accrued liabilities.
The difference between the value of the assets and the value of the projected accrued liabilities of the three principal schemes after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pension increases is being amortised over periods of between 8.5 and 12 years, being the average expected remaining service lives of the pensionable employees.
Prepayments of 263m 2003 239m are included in debtors and accruals of 22m 2003 29m are included in provisions for liabilities and charges, being the differences between the accumulated amounts paid into the pension funds and the accumulated pension costs.
Post-retirement benets other than pensions In the USA, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, the Groups employment practices include the provision of healthcare and life insurance benets for retired employees.
In the USA, 540 retired employees currently benefit from these provisions and it is estimated that 4,385 current employees will be eligible on retirement.
The cost of post-retirement benets other than pensions for the Group was 15m 2003 17m.
Provisions for the benefit obligations at December 31, 2004 amounted to 124m 2003 119m and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
There were no plan assets at either December 31, 2004 or December 31, 2003.
The future costs of benets are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries and are based on a weighted average discount rate of 5.8% and a weighted average assumed healthcare costs trend rate of 8% grading down to 5% over seven years.

The valuations with respect to UK schemes have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as noted above and updated by the scheme actuary to December 31, 2004 taking account of the requirements of FRS 17.
For the material overseas dened benefit schemes the last formal actuarial valuations have been updated to December 31, 2004 by a qualied actuary taking account of the requirements of FRS 17.
