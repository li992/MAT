Also included is 4.8m before tax nil relating to the cost of ancillary litigation and bodily injury claims against discontinued operations in the USA.
These cash costs now exceed the provision established at the time of demerger and charges of a similar nature are expected in the future.
The impairments recorded in the current year relate to: one of the groups North American joint-ventures, which has been written down to its expected net realisable value, pending its disposal: a number of aggregates sites in the UK, identied as uneconomic following the strategic review of the UK Aggregates business and due to be closed, and certain other operations mainly in Asia and Europe.
The impairment charges recorded in the current year include 27.7m 46.2m, 28.5m in respect of tangible net assets and 21.9m 38.4m, 58.5m in respect of goodwill.
The net tax credit in total relating to the above exceptional items amounts to 41.2m 2003 net tax credit of 42.5m, 2002 net tax charge of 22.9m.
Impairment charges represent the difference between the book value and the higher of net realisable value and value in use of the asset or group of assets identied as impaired.
Value in use calculations used in impairment testing are based on projections of discounted cash ows of the asset or group of assets concerned.
Cash ows used in value in use calculations are discounted using the country specic weighted average cost of capital rate, which ranges from 8.0% to 10.0%.
Appropriately qualied individuals have been involved in impairment calculations to ensure that the value in use or net realisable value is properly stated.

Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief or offset existing capital losses.
The group does not expect any tax to become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of tax on gains arising from the revaluation of xed assets, as the group is not committed to disposal of these assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued.
Tax losses and other timing differences with a value of 78.8m have not been recognised as their use is uncertain or not currently anticipated.
8 Earnings per ordinary share The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share of 26.4p 24.4p, 25.2p is based on the weighted average of 734,257,732 733,948,618, 734,973,616 ordinary shares in issue during the year and profit for the financial year of 193.6m 179.2m, 185.2m.
The pre-exceptional basic earnings per ordinary share of 35.0p 32.7p, 34.9p is calculated using the same number of shares referred to above and on earnings of 256.7m 240.1m, 256.6m.
Earnings per share is also calculated below, before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, since the Directors consider that this gives a useful indication of underlying performance.
The calculation of the diluted earnings per ordinary share of 26.1p 24.2p, 25.0p is based on the weighted average of 741,288,220 740,405,972, 740,907,866 ordinary shares and the profit after taxation of 193.6m 179.2m, 185.2m.
The pre-exceptional diluted earnings per ordinary share of 34.6p 32.4p, 34.6p is calculated using the same number of shares referred to immediately above and on earnings of 256.7m 240.1m, 256.6m.

The basic earnings number used has been adjusted by adding back goodwill amortisation and exceptional items above, and adjusted basic earnings per share gures have been calculated on this basis.
The diluted earnings per share gure of 26.1p 24.2p, 25.0p is calculated by taking the basic number of shares above and adjusting these for the notional exercise of outstanding option and sharesave awards, where these would be deemed to have a dilutive impact.
Adjusted diluted earnings per share amounts have been calculated by adding back goodwill amortisation and exceptional items to the basic earnings number.
9 profit on ordinary activities after taxation As permitted by the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account.
The loss for the year dealt with in the accounts of Hanson was 19.8m profit of 200.0m.
After dividends of 136.2m 84.5m the loss for the year was 156.0m profit of 115.5m.
These have no impact on net book value.
# Additions at cost include an amount of 6.3m in respect of expected plant decommissioning costs.

The provision for the gross cost of asbestos is shown above.
The related insurance asset is included within debtors due after one year in note 14 and the deferred tax asset relating to asbestos payments is included within deferred and other taxation above.
Claimant numbers and costs during the year Information regarding the movement in asbestos claimants in the year and the cost of resolution in the year is provided below: 2004 2003 2002 New claimants 18,700 28,900 32,200 Ohio duplicates 22,000 Resolutions 7,150 8,200 18,200 Outstanding claimants 135,750 124,200 81,500 Average gross cost of resolution $ 8,294 5,268 2,049 Gross cost of resolution $m 59.3 43.2 37.3 Less insurance recoveries $m 46.5 39.4 33.2 Net cost before tax $m 12.8 3.8 4.1 At the end of 2004, outstanding claimants totalled approximately 135,750 124,200, 81,500.
In the USA claimants can le without illness or product identication.
In the absence to date of federal reform, a number of states are looking to introduce an unimpaired docket which will suspend claims until there is proven evidence of illness.
Notwithstanding these state level reforms, however, we continue to believe that the outstanding number of claimants is more likely to rise than fall in the near term.
New claimants were 18,700 for 2004, 35% less than the 28,900 claimants in 2003.
Most of the reduction was due to fewer mass claims being led in the period.
Mass claimants in Mississippi have slowed signicantly since new legislation was introduced effective April 1, 2003 to limit out of state mass lings.
An additional 22,000 claimants were recognised in Ohio in 2003 to count each duplicate claim against two subsidiaries twice previously only counted once.
The gross cost of resolving asbestos claims in 2004 was $59.3m $43.2m, $37.3m including legal fees of $27.4m $21.4m, $16.0m.
The net cost of asbestos for the year after insurance was $12.8m $3.8m, $4.1m.
Of the claimants whose cases were resolved during 2004, approximately 80% were dismissed without payment.
The aggregate amounts paid in settlement and average settlement payments in any given period, together with related defence costs, have uctuated widely and are expected to continue to uctuate widely depending on the nature of the claims resolved including the proportion of which that are mass claims, disease mix, number of other defendants and jurisdiction of claim.
66 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 17 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Each of the Companys relevant US subsidiaries, together with its insurance carriers and outside counsel, review each asbestos claim that is pursued by the claimants.
In many cases the claimants are unable to demonstrate that any injury they have suffered resulted from exposure to the subsidiarys products, in which case their claim is generally dismissed without payment.
In those cases where a compensable disease, exposure to the subsidiarys products and causation can be established, the subsidiary generally settles for amounts that reect the type of disease, the seriousness of the injury, the age of the claimant, the particular jurisdiction of the claim and the number and solvency of the other defendants.
The Companys approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against those US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and reliably estimable.
The costs of resolving possible claims are accounted for as contingent liabilities refer note 27.
At present, based on detailed analysis and the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost at current levels.
Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution are not able to be reliably estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these possible liabilities.
Assumptions made relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claims, trends in dismissal rates, settlement and defence costs, resolution of all existing claims, time scale of resolution of new claims, the continued solvency of co-defendants and expected insurance recoveries.
In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provisions for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provisions will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and trends change.
Gross cost provision In total, the full year increase in the provision for future asbestos costs was US$222.5m, including a second half charge of US$187.5m, taking the gross provision to US$480.0m before discounting.
This is equivalent to a pre-tax charge of 121.6m less 41.9m for discounting to give a net pre-tax charge of 79.7m and a discounted deferred tax credit of 31.1m.
Insurance asset The insurance asset before discounting reduced to $26.1m at December 31, 2004 following utilisation of $46.5m during the year.
Most of the subsidiaries involved with asbestos claims have had agreements with their respective insurance carriers regarding the defence and settlement of asbestos claims, the terms of which varied for each such subsidiary.
These insurance arrangements have resulted in the insurance companies having met substantially all of the amounts such subsidiaries have paid in the past in settlements and defence costs.
Since July 1, 2004, one of the subsidiaries involved has started to make additional contributions to the cost of settlement.
The insurance asset recognised by the Company at December 31, 2004 is assumed to be realised over the next four years.
We continue to use a combination of litigation and negotiation to maximise the insurance cover available.
One of the Companys subsidiaries is involved in litigation proceedings in the state of California with its insurers, with a view to establishing whether or not substantially all of the primary cover available to that subsidiary has been exhausted and, to the extent that such cover has been exhausted, the amount of excess cover that is available to it.
Two other subsidiaries of the Company are seeking to increase the amount of insurance cover available and have initiated legal proceedings in the state of Pennsylvania.
Notes to the accounts 67 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 17 Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Risk factors Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates and expectations include: i adverse trends in the ultimate number of asbestos claims led against the Companys US subsidiaries: ii increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement costs, dismissal rates, legal fees and or judgment sizes: iii decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims as a result of adverse changes in the interpretation of insurance policies or the insolvency of insurers: iv the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the scope of potential claimants: v the impact of bankruptcies of other companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Companys US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws: vi the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process: vii adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Companys US subsidiaries, and viii potential legislative changes.
In light of such factors, the liability of the Companys US subsidiaries involved in resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current estimates and the impact of such claims might have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash ow.
However, assuming that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that the liability and costs associated with its US subsidiaries asbestos claims will have such a material adverse effect and, even assuming a material deterioration in current trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Other provisions Long-term provisions except deferred tax have been discounted at rates of up to 6.25%.
Healthcare and obligations to employees relate to post-retirement health and benefit costs of current and retired employees and are described in note 29.
Environmental and reclamation provisions have been established to cover those situations where the group has either a legal or contractual obligation to remedy known exposures.
Reclamation provisions are expected to be utilised over the life of the relevant quarry.
Legal and insurance and other provisions relate to acquisitions, disposals and rationalisations both arising on acquisitions and provided for in current and prior years.
Legal and insurance, environmental and other provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation.
Where appropriate, environmental and reclamation provisions have been established after taking into account the opinions of suitably qualied and experienced consultants and after estimating the costs in line with current practice and standards.
The liabilities for deferred and other taxation provided were as follows: 2004 2003 m m Excess of capital allowances over depreciation 157.2 170.3 Short-term timing differences 47.5 81.0 Deferred tax asset relating to asbestos costs 76.6 53.7 Other 78.4 98.8 111.5 134.4 Accounting Policies Deferred Taxation page 51 outlines those categories for which no deferred tax is provided.
18 Koppers liabilities Koppers environmental obligations and related costs relate to the former US chemical operations disposed of by Beazer PLC prior to its acquisition by Hanson in 1991.
Beazer and certain of its subsidiaries remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations.
During 1998 an agreement was signed under which, for a one-off premium and related transaction costs totalling $275.0m paid by the group, insurance cover of $800.0m in perpetuity after payment by the group of the first $100.0m of remediation costs arising since January 1, 1998 was provided by subsidiaries of two re-insurance companies, Centre Solutions and Swiss Re.
At the end of 2004, $350.0m of the insurance cover had been utilised.
The estimate of future probable cost, discounted at 5.1% 6.75%, and transferred to insurers is matched by amounts due from insurers, as shown in prepayments, and is as follows: 2004 2003 m m At January 1 201.2 199.5 Increase in prepayment liability due to discounting 10.0 12.4 Increase in prepayment liability due to reappraisal of liabilities 4.6 63.2 Decrease in prepayment liability due to settlements 39.5 52.6 Exchange movements 14.1 21.3 At December 31 162.2 201.2 The Company estimates that this insurance cover is sufficient to meet future costs.
The matched increase in the asset liability during 2004 recognises the possibility of increased claims in future years.
Factors which could cause actual remediation costs to differ from these estimates include i unknown adverse conditions arising at sites: ii third party claims in excess of estimates: iii changes to regulatory requirements for remedial technology iv any other significant variations to assumptions made in support of these estimates.

Claims and lawsuits have been led against these subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals, in particular for the wood treating industry.
Asbestos The Companys approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and reliably estimable refer note 17.
The costs of resolving possible claims are accounted for as contingent liabilities.
In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provisions for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provisions will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and developments occur.
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates and expectations include: i adverse trends in the ultimate number of asbestos claims led against the Companys US subsidiaries: ii increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement costs, dismissal rates, legal fees and or judgment sizes: iii decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims as a result of adverse changes in the interpretation of insurance policies or the insolvency of insurers: iv the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the scope of potential claimants: v the impact of bankruptcies of other companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Companys US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws: vi the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process: vii adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Companys US subsidiaries, and viii potential legislative changes.
74 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 27 Contingent liabilities continued Details of asbestos claims against the Companys US subsidiaries of the Company, the approach to provisioning and the associated contingent liabilities are detailed in note 17.
At December 31, 2004, approximately 135,750 claimants were outstanding.
The amounts of compensation formally claimed in the cases initially led by these claimants vary but typically follow standard formulations that are used in various jurisdictions by various plaintiffs law rms.
Of the claimants outstanding as of December 31, 2004, Hanson estimates that approximately 53% do not specify a dollar claim for damages, approximately 39% claim an amount greater than US$25,000 and approximately 8% specify various amounts, typically greater than specified amounts between US$50,000 and US$1m.
Hanson is not aware of any claim specifying an amount greater than US$40m.
Hanson does not believe that the specic dollar amount mentioned in the claim is an accurate gauge of what relief, if any, the claimant may eventually recover from one of Hansons US subsidiaries, and most claimants fail to allocate their alleged claims of liability amongst the various named defendants.
Demerger In connection with the Demergers, each of the four companies into which the Company demerged its respective businesses agreed to indemnify the Company against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of the businesses transferred to it on its respective demerger while the Company agreed to indemnify each of these companies against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of all other businesses owned or previously owned by the Company including the businesses transferred to the other demerged companies.
Neither the Company nor any of its existing subsidiaries has incurred any liability in respect of a claim that related to the above-mentioned businesses demerged by the Company, any such liability being borne by the relevant demerged company without liability to the Company or any of its existing subsidiaries.
The Energy Group PLC, one of the demerged companies, was acquired by TXU Corp. in 1998.
In November 2002, TXU Corp. announced that several of TXU Corps UK subsidiaries had been placed under the administration process in the UK, including The Energy Group PLC.
The Energy Group PLC itself is therefore unlikely to be able to full its indemnification obligations to the Company and its existing subsidiaries if and when required.
The Company is, however, not aware of any claims against it or its subsidiaries that would give rise to an indemnity obligation on the part of The Energy Group PLC.
Bonds and guarantees As at December 31, 2004 the group had contingent liabilities in respect of bank guarantees and performance bonds given to third parties amounting to 19.3m 34.3m, of which 0.2m 4.4m relates to former trading activities of the group: 81.6m 118.8m in surety bonds issued primarily to US public authorities by US insurance companies in respect of reclamation liabilities of 42.1m 43.2m, performance bonds of 31.2m 64.9m and other surety obligations of 8.3m 10.7m.
The groups bankers have also issued letters of credit of 78.5m 94.9m, primarily relating to environmental and restoration obligations and the deductible element of insurance programmes.
The liabilities under the guarantees and bonds are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
Other issues In addition to US asbestos claims, the Companys former and existing subsidiaries are subject from time to time to bodily injury and property damage claims and lawsuits, both on an individual and class action basis, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations.
Such claims and lawsuits relate primarily to former US chemical products and operations, in particular those relating to the wood treating and coal tar derivative industries: products and operations which are unrelated to the groups present business and activities.
In such cases where one of the Companys subsidiaries is involved, there are often several potential defendants named in the claim or lawsuit.
Since the Demergers no settlements have been paid by, or judgments rendered against, any of the Companys subsidiaries which have had or could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow in connection with any such claims or lawsuits.
In a number of instances, the claim or lawsuit against the subsidiary has not been pursued and has been dismissed.
With respect to those claims or lawsuits that have been or are being pursued, the subsidiary concerned generally believes itself to have had or to have meritorious defences and such claims and lawsuits have been and are being vigorously defended.
Insurance issues do arise on these claims and lawsuits, both in terms of settlement and defence coverage, the outcome of which can be uncertain.
In certain instances no insurance coverage may be available to the relevant subsidiary.
The insurance cover referred to in note 18 relating to the Koppers environmental obligations does not apply to the bodily injury claims and lawsuits described in this note, although it will address certain of the property damage claims.
The cost relating to these claims is shown in note 5.
Several of the Companys subsidiaries are subject to litigation in California courts arising out of sand dredging operations on submerged lands leased from the state of California.
The litigation involves allegations that these subsidiaries underpaid royalties due under the leases and that sand was dredged from state owned lands without authorisation.
The litigation includes claims by the state of California under California statutes providing for the recovery of treble damages and certain fines, penalties and attorney fees where the wrongful conduct involves false statements or conversion of state owned property.
A press release by the California Attorney General states that he is seeking damages of $200m, although the complaint actually led in court does not specify the amount of damages sought.
The Company believes the claims are largely based on an incorrect interpretation of the relevant leases and its subsidiaries are aggressively defending the matter.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation, no assurances or predictions can be made on the outcome of this litigation.
Various subsidiaries of the Company are also the subject of a number of other pending legal proceedings incidental to present and former operations, acquisitions and disposals.
The Company does not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation and in particular in the USA, where there is the added potential for punitive damage awards, there can be no guarantee that a settlement might have to be made by, or an unfavourable judgment may be rendered against, the Company or one of its subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash ow in connection with the above mentioned non-asbestos claims and lawsuits.

The benets provided by these plans are based primarily on years of credited service and final average pensionable pay as dened under the respective plan provisions.
The Company, together with the relevant trustees of the various dened benefit plans, has a policy of ongoing review of the investment guidelines of each of the plans.
The UK dened benefit plans were closed to new employees joining the group after July 2002 and a new dened contribution plan was put into place.
In the UK, the current level of employer contributions to dened contribution plans ranges from 5-10% dependent on the level of employee contribution.
During 2004 the Company continued with its own review of funding policy of the main US and UK dened benefit plans which built on the work carried out in 2003.
The Company continues to adopt a funding policy that targets the accrued benefit obligation, which is higher than applicable statutory minimum funding levels in each country.
Contributions by the Company totalled 57.8m in the year, principally in the USA, Canada, UK and Australia.
In respect of the principal UK dened benefit plan, in addition to the ongoing regular contributions, the Company is scheduled to make additional payments of 8.4m in each of the next five years.
The Company has not currently concluded on the level of contributions to the dened contribution or US dened benefit plans for the following year.
Hanson also participates in several multi-employer plans, principally in the USA, which provide dened benets to certain of the groups union employees.
Multi-employer plans are accounted for as dened contribution schemes, since it is not possible to isolate the individual components of the charge that relate to the group from the other employers that participate in the plans.
Contributions relating to multi-employer plans are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements.
The surpluses and deficits in the multi-employer plans are not considered to have a material impact on the Company.
The employer contributions to pension plans were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Employer Employer Employer contribution contribution contribution m m m Dened benefit plans additional 8.4 74.0 Dened benefit plans regular 38.0 7.6 5.2 Dened contribution plans including overseas plans 7.6 7.0 5.2 Multi-employer plans 3.8 4.3 6.3 Total pensions 57.8 92.9 16.7 ii SSAP 24 The information below concerns the treatment of pensions and other post-retirement benets in the group accounts under accounting standard SSAP 24.
Pension plans The group accounts for pensions, in particular the change to the profit and loss account, under SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The objective of the standard is to spread pension costs systematically over the period for which benets are received from the employees services.
76 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 29 Pensions and other post-retirement benets continued UK plans the pension charge in respect of UK dened benefit plans is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using, in general, the projected unit method.
Actuarial reviews are carried out every three years.
Past service surpluses and deficits are amortised over the average remaining working lifetimes of the current workers in the relevant plan.
US plans a complete valuation of each US plan is undertaken by independent qualied actuaries every year.
The pension charge for such plans is charged based upon actuarial calculations determined in accordance with US accounting standard SFAS 87 Employers accounting for pensions, as permitted under SSAP 24.
The pension charge in respect of dened contribution plans represents the contributions made and accrued for the period.
The charge to the profit and loss account under SSAP 24 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 P&L charge P&L charge P&L charge SSAP 24 P&L charge m m m Dened benefit plans 25.5 20.0 6.4 Dened contribution plans including overseas plans 7.6 7.0 5.2 Multi-employer plans 3.8 4.3 6.3 Total pensions 36.9 31.3 5.1 Over time, the service cost element of the pension profit and loss charge in respect of the Companys closed UK dened benefit plans is expected to rise as the members approach retirement.
The assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuations carried out as at January 1, 2004 for the USA plans and the principal UK plan by independent qualied actuaries are set out below.
UK USA % pa % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.00 4.25 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.50 Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.40 6.25 Expected return on assets 7.50 At the dates of the latest actuarial valuations of the dened benefit plans which were within the group at December 31, 2004, the market values of the assets of the plans amounted to approximately 1.7bn.
The assessed value of these assets represented approximately 97% of the liabilities for benets that had accrued to members, allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
Other post-retirement benets Hanson provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets, mainly in the USA, under a combination of funded and unfunded plans to certain groups of its retired and active employees.
Hanson conforms with the provisions of the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benets other than Pensions UITF 6, which requires accrual of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benets, in accordance with SSAP 24.
The charge to the profit and loss account under SSAP 24 is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Other post-retirement benets 4.1 3.9 3.1 Included above: Service costs 1.1 1.4 1.0 The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities on a SSAP 24 basis for post-retirement benets are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Weighted average discount rate 5.75 6.25 6.75 Initial post-retirement benefit trend rate 10.0-5.0 9.0-5.0 10.0-5.0 2004, 2003 and 2002 assumed to decrease by 1% per annum to 5% The total post-retirement obligations at December 31, 2004 are as follows: 2004 2003 m m Accumulated benefit obligations 68.2 75.3 Deferred actuarial variations 16.8 20.5 85.0 95.8 Other post-retirement obligations 13.2 13.4 Total post-retirement obligations 98.2 109.2 Notes to the accounts 77 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 29 Pensions and other post-retirement benets continued iii FRS 17 The information below comprises the additional disclosures required by accounting standard FRS 17 Retirement benets and shows, inter alia, what the effect on the group accounts would have been if the Company had adopted FRS 17 for 2004.
The object of FRS 17 disclosures is to present the pension and other post-retirement benefit plans assets and liabilities at their fair value at the balance sheet date and to separate the charge for pensions benets accruing to employees in the period from the details of investment returns.
The date of the most recent actuarial valuation of the principal UK and the US plans is January 1, 2004.
Qualied independent actuaries have updated these valuations to December 31, 2004, in order to calculate the funded status of the plans as at the year end.
Each of the dened benefit plans has independent trustees and some differentiating characteristics, and as a result there are a range of investment policies and parameters.
In practice, however, all of the major plans utilise some level of xed income securities ranging from 40% to 100% with the residual invested primarily in equities with a strong bias toward domestic equity markets.
In the UK, the objective of the trustees in investing the assets of the plans is to provide returns from its investments in the form of both income and capital growth to enable the liability requirements of the plans to be met over their long-term future.
Account has been taken of the maturity proles of the plans in setting the investment strategy with a policy that investment of the assets within the plans is in xed interest and index-linked securities as a broad match for the pensioner liability.
Although the trustees do not believe that it is practicable to set targets for the expected return on investments over a particular time period, the asset allocation selected is designed to achieve a higher return than the lowest risk strategy whilst maintaining a prudent approach to meeting the plans liabilities.
In the USA, the investment policy of the trustees is designed to maximise the total return on assets with a strong emphasis on preservation of capital in real terms.
Assets should participate in rising markets, with defensive action in declining markets expected to an even greater degree.
The total portfolio is expected to be less volatile than the market the majority of the time, although individual managers portfolios may be characterised by higher levels of volatility.
The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities on a FRS 17 basis for the significant dened benefit plans as at December 31, 2004 are set out below: 2004 2004 2003 2003 2002 2002 United Unites United United United United Kingdom States Kingdom States Kingdom States % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.50 4.25 4.50 4.25 4.50 4.25 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.75 2.50 2.50 Discount rate applied to plan liabilities 5.30 5.75 5.40 6.25 5.50 6.75 Ination assumption 2.75 2.50 2.50 3.50 2.50 3.50 Investigations have been carried out recently into the mortality experience of the major schemes in both the UK and the USA.

It also includes the principal amount of any forward exchange contracts undertaken to manage the translation exposure of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
Fixed rate US dollar liabilities represent the $681.6m of the $750m bond repayable on September 15, 2005 and $250m of the $750m bond due September 27, 2010.
The xed rate liabilities in Australian dollars represent the net notional principal of interest rate swaps.
Interest rate swaps starting at dates in the future are included in the weighted average period, but excluded from the weighted average rate, in the table above.
Floating rate financial assets comprise cash deposits, the receivable element of forward exchange contracts and commercial paper.
The majority of oating rate financial assets and liabilities bear interest based on the equivalents of LIBOR.
The group has taken advantage of the FRS 13 exemption to exclude debtors and creditors due within one year from this note.
Also excluded is the Koppers liability and other discounted provisions which are accounted for at a discount of 5.1% 6.75%.
These are all non interest bearing.

The effects of any interest rate hedges are recognised over the life of the hedge.
Foreign exchange hedges are evaluated against the closing exchange rate at the balance sheet date and the resultant gain or loss is matched with that of the underlying asset or liability in the accounts.
As a result, the unrecognised gain or loss is a function of market rates at the balance sheet date and is not indicative of gains or losses which will be recognised in future accounting periods.

For long-term, traded xed rate financial liabilities and interest rate swaps, fair value is estimated as the net present value of the future cash ows as implied by current yield curves.
Commodity swaps are valued at market price.
Foreign exchange contracts, being generally short-term in nature, are valued against the spot exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
For debtors due after one year note 14 and provisions for liabilities and charges notes 17 and 18 fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value, and is not included in the table above.

32 Subsequent events On January 4, 2005, Hanson announced that it had completed the acquisition of Marshalls Clay Products Limited for a total consideration of 65m.
There have been no other significant events since December 31, 2004.
33 US accounting information a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles The groups accounts have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the USA US GAAP.
These differences relate principally to the following items, and the effect of each of the adjustments to profit for the financial year and equity shareholders funds that would be required under US GAAP is set out below.
Intangible assets Under UK GAAP prior to January 1, 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off directly to reserves.
Since December 31, 1997, all acquired goodwill has been capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
On disposal of a business, the profit or loss on disposal is determined after incorporating the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill, including any previously written off to reserves.
Under US GAAP prior to January 1, 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to July 1, 2001, was capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful life, not exceeding 40 years.
Under the transition provisions of SFAS 142 Goodwill and other intangible assets, goodwill which arose during the period subsequent to July 1, 2001 was capitalised, but has not been amortised.
From January 1, 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed annually for impairment.
Under US GAAP, separately identied intangible assets arising on acquisitions are capitalised and amortised over their useful lives of between one and eight years.
Under UK GAAP, these assets are included within goodwill.
Impairment of goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill is reviewed for potential impairment where there is an indication that impairment may have occurred.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of goodwill for each income generating unit IGU with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill impairment test as required by SFAS 142.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit with its fair value.
Where the carrying value including any separately identied intangible assets is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill.
Where reporting units identied under US GAAP differ from IGUs identied under UK GAAP, a reconciling item may arise.
Asset recognition Under UK GAAP, contingent assets become recognisable in accordance with the criteria set out in Financial Reporting Standard 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Where such an asset is recognised under UK GAAP, it is discounted to its present value based on the timing of expected cash ows.
Although broadly similar, there are certain circumstances under US GAAP where a contingent asset can only be recognised if additional criteria are met.
Pensions The cost of post-retirement benets is based on consistent percentages of employees pensionable pay as recommended by independent actuaries.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost or credit is determined by reference to the pension liability and the market value of the underlying plan assets, after adjustment to reect any previously unrecognised pension obligations or assets.
For certain pension plans the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31, 2004 exceeded the fair value of related plan assets.
Where a pension plan has an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation, US GAAP requires such amount to be recognised as a liability in the balance sheet.
The adjustment resulting from the recognition of any such minimum liability, including the elimination of amounts previously recognised as a prepaid benefit cost, is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of unrecognised prior service cost with the remaining amount reported in comprehensive income.
Under USGAAP, experience surpluses or deficiencies, which may result where the actual performance of the scheme differs from previous actuarial assumptions, are dealt with on an aggregate basis.
The group applies the 10% corridor test at the beginning of the year, to determine whether amortisation of the gain or loss is necessary.
Where the gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligations or the market related value of the schemes assets, this is amortised over the active participants average remaining service periods.
The group also provides post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benets, mainly in the USA, under plans to certain groups of its retired and active employees.
The group conforms with the provisions of the UITF 6 Accounting for post-retirement benets other than pensions, which require accruals of these costs over the period during which employees become eligible for such benets.
UITF 6 permits UK parent undertakings with US subsidiaries to adopt the cost of post-retirement benets calculated for SFAS 106 Employers accounting for post-retirement benets other than pensions in their SSAP 24 calculations under UK GAAP and therefore there is no reconciling item in respect of the groups US post-retirement benets.
Notes to the accounts 83 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 33 US accounting information continued a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles continued Deferred tax Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences, except those that relate to revaluations where no sale is in process, or where it is probable that rollover relief or losses will be applied to the gain, and also to the remittance of retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, except where no dividends have been accrued as receivable at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation liabilities are provided on differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities except in certain limited circumstances.
Deferred taxation assets under US and UK GAAP are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realised.
Discontinued operations Discontinued operations are those clearly distinguishable operations and activities which either ceased or left the group in the accounting period or soon thereafter.
Under US GAAP, discontinued operations also include those held for sale, which are probable of completing within one year.
Acquisition accounting USGAAPrequires that a deferred tax asset or liability be raised to reect the difference between the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and their fair values at the time of acquisition.
Under UKGAAP, FRS 7 as amended by FRS 19, states that on acquisition deferred tax should be recognised on fair value adjustment in accordance with FRS 19.
As such, there is generally a difference where the fair value adjustments increase the value of the assets acquired as generally under USGAAP a deferred tax liability is established.
However, such liability is generally not established under UKGAAP.
The recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities affects the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition.
Net income under US GAAP will differ from UK GAAP to the extent that the timing of reversal of the temporary differences acquired differs from the timing of goodwill amortisation.
Under UK GAAP, on acquisition, provisions for reorganisation costs are not included in the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired, but are included in post-acquisition costs.
Certain reorganisation provisions under US GAAP are allowed to be included within the fair value at the time of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, the inventories in acquired companies are valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, inventories are recognised at the time of acquisition on the basis of expected net sales proceeds, with the difference being recognised as the inventory is sold.
Under UK GAAP, when shares are issued as consideration for an acquisition, the acquisition price is based upon the share price at the date the acquisition is unconditional.
Under US GAAP, the acquisition price is based upon the share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the date that the acquisitions are agreed to and announced.
Joint-ventures and associates Operating profit, interest and taxation in respect of joint-ventures and associates are included in the accounts separately under each appropriate heading.
Under US GAAP, profit after tax of joint-ventures and associates are included on a single line within the profit and loss account.
The main adjustments that would have been necessary to reconcile the joint-ventures and associates not domiciled within the United States to US GAAP would have been in respect of deferred tax, pensions and goodwill.
The group has not included a reconciling item for these adjustments, as the effect on net income is not material.
Dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary dividends are provided in the year in respect of which they are proposed on the basis of recommendation by the Directors, although this requires subsequent approval by the shareholders.
Interim dividends are provided for in the period for which they are declared by the Directors.
Under US GAAP, dividends are not provided until the dividend is formally declared.
Accounting for stock-based compensation The group operates an Inland Revenue approved Sharesave Scheme open to all employees, which gives a 20% discount on the fair value of its shares.
Under UK GAAP no cost is recognised on awards under such a scheme.
Under US GAAP, the 20% discount should be expensed over the vesting period.
All plans from 2000 are impacted.
The group also operates two schemes which incorporate performance criteria, the Hanson Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Under UK GAAP, the expense is recognised over the performance period, based on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.
Adjustments to the expense are made as estimates of the number of awards expected to vest are updated.
Under US GAAP, the plans are treated as variable compensatory plans and the expense is based on the intrinsic value, remeasured at each balance sheet date and spread over the performance period.
Under US GAAP, the group applies the methodologies set out in APB 25 Accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations, and is permitted to adopt the disclosure required by SFAS 123 Accounting for stock-based compensation and as amended by SFAS 148 Accounting for stock-based compensation transaction and disclosure.
Due to the groups adoption of UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee share schemes and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts under UK GAAP in 2004, the groups reconciliation of profit for the financial year for 2003 and 2002 and equity shareholders funds for 2003 from UK GAAP to US GAAP have been restated.
This is explained in the Accounting Policies on page 51.
Net income and shareholders equity under US GAAPare as previously reported.
Derivative instruments and hedging activities Hedging policy The group enters into derivative instruments to limit its exposure to interest rate and foreign exchange risks.
Under UK GAAP, these instruments are not required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, but are accounted for as described in the Accounting policies on page 52.
Under US GAAP, derivative instruments, whether designated as a hedge or not, are required to be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value.
As the group has elected not to adopt hedge accounting for the purposes of SFAS 133 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities, the reconciliation to net income fully reects the changes in fair value of the derivatives, other than net investment hedges.
Hedges of net investments and the treatment of realised and unrealised gains and losses are the same as under UKGAAP being taken to equity reserves.
84 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 33 US accounting information continued a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles continued Transition adjustment In addition, under US GAAP, transition adjustments were required to include the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet on the adoption of SFAS 133 at January 1, 2001.
For those derivatives considered as fair value hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening fair value of 17.1m was shown as current assets and liabilities derivatives and as an adjustment to debt.
The adjustment to debt is being subsequently amortised through the income statement over the residual life of the debt.
For those derivatives considered as cash ow hedges, the January 1, 2001 opening value of 0.5m was shown as current assets and liabilities derivatives, and as an adjustment to other comprehensive income.
The amounts in other comprehensive income are recognised as adjustments to interest expense in future periods as the related cash ows are recognised.
Foreign exchange gains and losses on disposals of businesses Under UK GAAP, cumulative foreign exchange gains and losses relating to disposals are adjusted within reserves.
Under US GAAP, these gains and losses are included in determining the profit or loss on disposal of the business.
Exceptional items Certain exceptional items are shown on the face of the profit and loss account after operating profit.
Under US GAAP these items would be classied as operating profit or expenses.
Non-monetary transactions Exchanges of assets that are similar in nature and that have a similar use in the same line of business are not regarded as transactions that generate revenue.
The cost of the new asset is based on the carrying value of the asset given up.
When dissimilar assets are exchanged, the transaction generates revenue.
The cost of the asset received is measured by its fair value, which is equivalent to the fair value of the asset given up adjusted by the amount of cash transferred.
Under UK GAAP, when investments in joint-ventures are exchanged for similar productive assets, the transaction is in part recorded at fair value and in part at historical cost.
Under US GAAP, the transaction is recorded at historical cost.
Capitalisation of interest costs Interest costs associated with the construction of major assets over a period of time, such as facilities for use by the company, should be capitalised as part of the cost of the tangible xed asset where the impact of the interest cost is material to the financial statements.
The interest cost capitalised represents an allocation of the interest cost incurred during the period required to complete construction of the asset.
Under UK GAAP, the requirement to capitalise interest costs is optional rather than being determined by the level of materiality of the cost itself.
The groups policy under UK GAAP is not to capitalise interest costs.
Provisions Under UK GAAP, provisions are discounted to reect the time-value of money based on the estimated timing of cashows.
US GAAP applies a stricter denition, permitting discounting only where the timing of cashows are xed or reliably determinable.
Inventory valuation Under UK GAAP, valuing inventory on a last-in-first-out LIFO basis is not permitted.
However, under US GAAP, where the inventory is valued on a LIFO basis for tax purposes in the local state, the same methodology must be used for accounting purposes.
Variable Interest Entities VIEs FIN 46 R requires the primary beneciary of variable interests in entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights to consolidate the VIE.
FIN 46 R became effective for periods ending after December 31, 2003.
The Company has adopted FIN 46 R in the year.
The group has identied a variable interest entity in which Hanson is the primary beneciary.
This entity is Piedras y Arenas Baja, S fide R L fide CV Piedras, a 50% joint-venture which previously has been equity accounted for under US GAAP.
In 2004, Piedras has been consolidated as a VIE.
Piedras is an aggregates producer located in Mexico which in 2004 had turnover of 9.9m 8.0m and a pre-tax loss of 1.1m 1.4m.
In addition it had net assets at December 31, 2004 of 3.5m 4.9m.
Approximately 90% of the annual turnover of Piedras is to the group.
There is no recourse to the general credit of the Company for creditors or beneficial interest holders of the consolidated VIE.
New US accounting standards and pronouncements not yet adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Statement No.
123 Revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123 R, which is a revision of SFAS 123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS 123.
SFAS 123 R supersedes APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB 25 which is the groups current accounting policy under US GAAP.
It also amends FASB Statement No.
The approach in SFAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123.
However, SFAS 123 R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of share options, to be recognised in the income statement based on their fair values.
The pro forma disclosure option under SFAS 123 will no longer be allowed.
As a result, the group expects to adopt the requirements of SFAS 123 R as its accounting policy for the financial year ended December 2005.
SFAS 123 R permits adoption of the requirements using one of two methods: a modied prospective method where the requirements are applied to all share-based payments granted after the effective date of the statement: or a modied retrospective method which allows entities to restate prior periods based on the amounts previously recognised under SFAS 123 for the purposes of pro forma disclosures.
Hanson plans to adopt SFAS 123 R using the modied retrospective method, restating all prior periods.
As permitted by SFAS 123, the group currently accounts for share-based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, normally recognises no compensation cost for employee stock options.
Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123 R s fair value method will impact the groups results of operations, although it will have no impact on the overall financial position.
The impact of adoption of SFAS 123 R cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share-based payments granted in the future.
However, had the group adopted SFAS 123 R in prior periods, the impact of the standard would have approximated the impact of SFAS 123 as described in the disclosure of pro-forma net income and earnings per share in Note 33 l. SFAS 123 R also requires the benets of tax deductions in excess of recognised compensation cost to be reported as a nancing cash ow rather than as an operating cash ow as it is reported currently.
This requirement will reduce net operating cash ows and increase net nancing cash ows in periods after adoption.
While the company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future, the amount of operating cash ows recognised in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were 1.1m, 0.7m and 1.1 m in 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.
Notes to the accounts 85 Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 33 US accounting information continued a Comparison of UK and US accounting principles continued In December 2004, the FASB issued FASB Statement No.
153 Exchanges of Non-monetary assets SFAS 153 which is an amendment to APB Opinion No.
29 Accounting for Non-monetary Transactions APB 29 as part of the FASBs short term convergence project with the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
APB 29 provided an exemption to its general principle of measuring such transactions at fair value where the exchange related to similar productive assets.
The exemption permitted the exchange to be valued at the recorded amount of the assets relinquished.
SFAS 153 removes this exemption so that all non-monetary transactions apart from those without commercial substance are recorded at fair value.
SFAS 153 is effective for transactions taking place after June 15, 2005 and should be applied prospectively.
As a result the group plans to adopt SFAS 153 for the financial year to December 2005.
The impact of adoption of SFAS 153 cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on whether applicable non-monetary transactions take place in the future.

These statements differ, however, with regard to classication of items within them.
Under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents include short-term liquid resources but not overdrafts.
Under UK GAAP, cash ows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, dividends, management of liquid resources and nancing.
US GAAP, however, requires only three categories of cash ow activity to be reported: operating, investing and nancing.
Cash ows from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance shown under UK GAAP, would be included as operating activities under US GAAP.
The payment of dividends would be included as a nancing activity under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, capitalised interest is treated as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and thus included as part of investing cash ows: under UK GAAP all interest is treated as part of returns on investments and servicing of finance.

The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for the plans with accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were 18.5m, 18.2m and 15.6m 2003 36.3m, 33.2m and 21.9m, respectively.

The Medicare Act introduces a prescription drug benefit under Medicare as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans.
As of December 31, 2003, the group gave consideration of the Medicare Acts changes to its retiree health benefit obligations by reducing the accumulated benefit obligation by approximately 12.4m for that portion of the benefit pertaining solely to prescription drugs.
This amount was reected in the actuarial gains of the roll forward of the accumulated benefit obligation for 2003.
The group has not recorded a benefit for this change in its net periodic benefit cost for 2003 but recorded income of approximately 2.0m in 2004.
The post-retirement welfare cost for the 2004 scal year was calculated assuming post-65 per capita medical claim costs would be reduced by 30% starting in 2006 as a result of the Company taking advantage, on a carve-out basis, of the federal contribution underlying the standard Medicare Part D plan.
There is no specic authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy, but when issued, it could cause the group to change previously reported information.
Assumed health care trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post-retirement medical benefit plans.
A one-percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects on active and non active liabilities as at December 31, 2004: 1-percentage 1-percentage point increase point decrease m m Effect on total of service and interest cost components 0.2 0.2 Effect on post-retirement medical benefit obligation 2.1 2.4 The US plans assets are primarily included in the Hanson Building Materials America Inc. Pension Trust Trust, which invests in listed stocks and bonds.
At December 31, 2002, December 31, 2003 and at December 31, 2004 the Trust had no investment in Hanson ordinary shares.
Within the UK, the fund assets are dealt with by several directly invested funds and as at December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 ordinary shares of Hanson within these funds comprised nil, nil and nil respectively of the total market value of such funds.
90 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts continued for the 12 months ended December 31, 2004 33 US accounting information continued i Additional information required by US GAAP in respect of accounting for the impairment of xed assets and for xed assets to be disposed of A summary of the impairment charges that have been recognised under US GAAP is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Assets to be disposed of 15.2 Assets to be held and used 372.2 72.8 937.4 372.2 72.8 952.6 Disclosed as: Impairment charges recognised under UK GAAP: Operating exceptional impairment charges 48.7 84.6 87.0 Non-operating exceptional provision for loss on disposal 15.2 Charge for the year under UK GAAP 48.7 84.6 102.2 Less: Adjustment to goodwill impairment recognised under US GAAP 323.5 11.8 58.1 Total charge before cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 372.2 72.8 44.1 Add: Cumulative effect on adoption of SFAS 142 under US GAAP 908.5 372.2 72.8 952.6 Charged against: Intangible assets goodwill 324.8 26.5 924.7 Investment in joint-ventures 20.5 Tangible assets 26.9 46.3 26.3 Trade creditors 1.6 372.2 72.8 952.6 During 2003 the Continental Europe and Asia division identied that certain of its operations contained goodwill with a carrying value that could not be covered by the projected cash ows of these businesses.
The full amount of this goodwill of 18.5m was provisionally impaired in 2003 pending completion of the impairment analysis.
This has been completed in 2004 and has not resulted in any adjustment to the provisional impairment previously recorded.
Of the amounts charged as impairments in 2004 under UK GAAP, nil 30.3m, 58.1m had been charged in prior years as amortisation under US GAAP or previously impaired under UK GAAP, and is therefore shown as a reduction in the difference between the charge under UK and US GAAP.
The operating exceptional charge of 48.7m in 2004 and 84.6m in 2003 under UK GAAP relates to various operations within North America, the UK and Asia Pacic, where it has been necessary to make an impairment provision for the difference in these operations carrying values compared with the higher of their value in use or net realisable value.
In 2004, an impairment charge of 320.8m has been recognised under US GAAP in relation to Hanson Aggregates UK goodwill following the annual SFAS 142 impairment review.
This relates in part to goodwill which was written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 and also reects the current assessment of implied goodwill following the recent strategic review of this business.
