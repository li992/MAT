46 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the principal accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, except for the adoption of the recently introduced UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and the revision to UITF 17 Employee share schemes referred to in paragraph l, is set out below: a Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of certain freehold and long leasehold properties.
In accordance with paragraph 3 3 of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, the directors have adapted the arrangement of certain headings in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated balance sheet to reect more appropriately the nature of the groups activities.
In particular, cost of sales includes net interest payable on bank and other borrowings and customers accounts receivable are disclosed separately on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to the end of the financial year.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of their acquisition or up to the date of their disposal.
Inter-company sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
c Goodwill Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of a business or company acquired, as represented by the consideration paid, and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and trading assets is capitalised at cost and subsequently amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
This reects the period over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses acquired is expected to exceed the value of the underlying assets.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions is reviewed for impairment, in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets and FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill, at the end of the first full year after acquisition and in other years if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Any impairment assessed is charged to the profit and loss account.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 10, up to 31 December 1997 goodwill arising on acquisitions was brought in at cost and offset rstly against negative goodwill arising during the year on similar acquisitions, secondly against available reserves and thereafter against retained profits brought forward.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1 January 1998 has not been reinstated.
On the subsequent disposal of any business to which previously written off goodwill attaches, the related amount is charged or credited in the profit and loss account as appropriate.
Cumulative goodwill relating to acquisitions made prior to 1998, excluding subsequent disposals, written off against reserves since 1 January 1989 amounted to 53 million.
The directors do not consider it practicable to extract information in respect of earlier periods.
Deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions is discounted using an appropriate discount rate, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting.
d Turnover Turnover, which is exclusive of value added tax and transactions nanced within the group, comprises: Instalment credit agreements Interest receivable, acceptance and similar fees, and early settlement fees Goods and services Gross amounts of goods or services supplied Debt collection Fees and commission income on external debt recovered and gross amounts collected on purchased debt Reinsurance Underwriting premiums earned Brokerage Commission income on loan applications referred to lenders and on the sale of insurance products to borrowers Leasing Rental income, interest receivable and arrangement fees Factoring Fees and nancing charges on debts factored Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 47 1 Accounting policies continued e Revenue recognition i Instalment credit agreements Interest receivable on secured and unsecured interest-bearing personal loan agreements is recognised on the accruals basis.
In the case of hire purchase agreements, interest receivable is computed at the inception of the loan, added to the customers balance and released to profit on the sum of the digits basis over the lesser of the contracted and effective term of the agreement.
In respect of home collected credit, an initial amount of the interest receivable is credited to the profit and loss account, mainly to cover the costs associated with the setting up of the transaction.
The remaining amount of interest receivable is carried forward in customers accounts receivable as deferred revenue.
This is calculated to adequately cover future collection and nancing costs and to allow for an appropriate contribution to profits in subsequent accounting periods.
Deferred revenue is released to profit on a straight line basis in proportion to the reduction in the collectible amount.
Acceptance fees and similar fees charged to borrowers at the inception of the loan are credited to the profit and loss account when charged.
Appropriate provision is made for the rebate of such fees, net of any related settlement fees on early redemption of the loan, where required under the terms of the loan agreement.
Fees charged to borrowers on the early settlement of the loans are credited to the profit and loss account as charged.
ii Debt collection Fees and commissions charged to third parties on the collection of debts are credited to the profit and loss account as charged.
Amounts collected in respect of purchased debt receivables are credited to the profit and loss account as received.
iii Reinsurance Reinsurance premiums receivable are accounted for net of cancellations, are allocated to each class of cover provided under the insurance agreement and are earned over the risk period of each class in an appropriate earnings pattern.
Reinsurance claims payable are accounted for on a notied basis, together with a provision for claims incurred but not reported.
iv Brokerage Commission in respect of the introduction of loans to third party lenders is credited to the profit and loss account as earned.
Commissions earned on the sale of single premium insurance products to borrowers are credited to the profit and loss account on inception of the policy.
Appropriate provision is made for the rebate of such commissions arising on the early termination or cancellation of the related insurance policy where required by the terms of the insurance contract.
v Leasing Assets owned and leased out to customers under operating lease agreements are recorded as xed assets.
Rental income is recognised on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
The amounts due from lessees under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are recorded as customers accounts receivable at the amount of the net investment in the lease.
The total gross interest receivable is allocated to accounting periods to give a constant periodic rate of return before tax on the net investment in each period.
Arrangement fees charged to customers are credited to the profit and loss account on inception of the lease.
f Customers accounts receivable Customers accounts receivable consist of amounts outstanding under instalment credit agreements, finance leases and factoring agreements including repayments not yet due at the year end, less appropriate provision for bad and doubtful debts based upon the individual assessment of accounts and formulae related to past experience.
The historic propensity for ultimate credit loss is based on the number of months since a full payment, or equivalent, has been received from a direct repayment customer and, in the case of a home collected customers loan, is based on the level of payments received during the latest thirteen week period of the loan.
g Default debt Default debt purchased is included at cost and is normally amortised over a period not exceeding six years at a rate based on the expected recoverability period of the debt.
48 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies continued h Pensions The group operates a dened benefit pension scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The expected cost of pensions is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the expected service lives of employees in the scheme.
Variations from the regular costs are spread over the average expected remaining working lives of current members in the scheme.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries.
The transitional disclosure requirements under FRS 17 Retirement benets have been adopted in these financial statements and are explained more fully in note 8.
The scheme was closed to new entrants from 1998.
The group also operates several dened contribution schemes.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes is the contributions payable.
Payments made to personal pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
The group provides no other post-retirement benets to its employees or directors.
i Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise, based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in different periods from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
j Stocks Stocks comprise motor vehicles held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
k Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are included at cost, unless, in the opinion of the directors, a permanent diminution in value has occurred, in which case the deficiency is provided for and charged in the companys profit and loss account.
l Investments own shares held UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and UITF 17 Employee share schemes revised 2003 have been adopted for the first time in 2004.
As a result of adopting UITF 38, shares in Cattles plc held by the Employee benefit Trust have been reclassied from xed asset investments to the profit and loss reserve within equity shareholders funds.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly.
As a result, equity shareholders funds at 31 December 2004 have decreased by 3.7 million 31 December 2003: 3.7 million and consideration in respect of the purchase and sale of own shares has been reclassied in the cash ow statement as nancing cash ows.
The prior year adjustment has had no impact on the profit and loss account in the current or previous year.
There has been no impact to the groups financial statements as a result of the revision to UITF 17 because the charge to the profit and loss account on the granting of applicable share awards is already based on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant.
The fair value of the shares is estimated to be the market value of the shares at that time.
m Tangible xed assets and depreciation The cost of xed assets is their purchase cost together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible xed assets on a straight line basis by reference to the estimated useful economic life and residual value of the assets concerned, at the following principal rates: Freehold buildings 2% per annum Long leasehold buildings 2% per annum Short leasehold expenditure 5% to 20% per annum Fixtures and equipment 10% to 20% per annum 1 Computer equipment and software licenses 20% to 33 3% per annum Motor vehicles 20% per annum Assets held for rental 20% per annum Assets held for rental comprise audio-visual electrical appliances, such as televisions, DVD and VCR players, which are hired by customers under a rental agreement.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold and long leasehold land.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 Tangible xed assets, the group has chosen to retain the book values of land and buildings which were previously revalued, and not to revalue the assets in the future.
Fixed assets are reviewed for impairment, in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill.
If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, any impairment in value is charged to the revaluation reserve or the profit and loss account, as appropriate.
Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 49 1 Accounting policies continued n Leasing Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the agreement and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the agreement and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the agreement in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease on a straight line basis.
o Borrowings Interest payable on bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings is charged to the profit and loss account as it is incurred.
Accrued finance charges and issue costs in relation to debenture loans, and facility fees in relation to bank borrowings, are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the loan and facility respectively.
p Hedging i Interest rate hedging The group manages the risk of the exposure of oating rate borrowings to adverse interest rate uctuations by the use of financial hedging instruments, primarily swaps.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these hedging instruments are recognised as adjustments to the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
The cost of any premium paid for the purchase of other financial hedging instruments, such as interest rate caps or collars, is amortised on a straight line basis over the life of the contract and reected in the profit and loss account in the total charge for interest on borrowings.
ii Foreign currencies All foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into Sterling at the commencement of the facility agreement.
Consequently, the group is not exposed to currency rate uctuations.
These borrowings are translated at the hedged rate.
q Current asset investments During 2004 the reinsurance company changed its current asset investment policy from a managed fund of mainly xed interest securities and bonds to wholly xed interest bank deposits.
Prior to the change, the managed fund investments were stated at market value, in accordance with the Association of British Insurers Statement of Recommended Practice on accounting for insurance business, with unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the market value of such securities and bonds being credited or charged to the profit and loss account.

The appointment of auditors to the groups pension scheme, and the fees paid in respect of such, are agreed by the trustees of the scheme, acting independently from the management of the group.
In appointing the external auditors to carry out non-audit related services, and in setting their fees for such work, the directors have due regard to the groups policy in respect of non-audit related services as set out in the Report of the Board on Corporate Governance on pages 29 and 30 and the benets, financial and non-financial, expected to be obtained.
In the opinion of the directors, these services should benefit the group in the future.
Further assurance services comprise work in relation to the transition to International Financial Reporting Standards and Financial Services Authority authorisation.
Other services relate to work on share schemes.
3 Holding company profit and loss account The consolidated profit includes 86.8 million 2003: 9.4 million, which has been dealt with in the financial statements of the company.
The company has taken advantage of section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and has not included its own profit and loss account in these financial statements.

Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 51 5 Taxation 2004 2003 The charge for taxation based on the profit for the year is as follows: 000 000 Current tax: UK corporation tax at 30% 2003: 30% 37,812 33,232 Adjustments in respect of previous years 3,839 52 41,651 33,180 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of timing differences 3,963 3,063 Adjustments in respect of previous years 3,070 360 42,544 36,603 The standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 30% 2003: 30%.

The total value of shares vested in the directors during the year under the Restricted Share Scheme was 843,000 2003: 314,000, which includes the first vestings of awards for two executive directors, S P Mahon and J J Corr, who joined the company in 2000 and 2001 respectively.
A detailed analysis of all directors emoluments, including salaries, benets in kind, performance related bonuses, share options, long term incentives and pension arrangements, is provided in the section entitled Audited Information of the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration on pages 38 to 41 and forms part of these financial statements.
The average monthly number of persons employed by the group during the year 2004 2003 was as follows: Number Number Consumer Division 4,781 4,512 Corporate Division 145 135 Central Support Services 51 48 Total 4,977 4,695 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 53 8 Pension costs SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs The group operates a funded dened benefit pension scheme for employees, which is contracted out of the state scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately in a trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualied actuary using the projected unit method.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from 1998.
Actuarial valuations are normally carried out triennially, the most recent valuation being as at 31 March 2004.
At that date the market value of the assets of the scheme was 34.6 million excluding assets relating to members additional voluntary contributions, representing 67% of the market-related value of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions, relative to price ination, which have the most significant effect on the results of the actuarial valuation, are those relating to the rate of return on assets and the rate of increase in earnings.
For the actuarial valuation, it was assumed that the return on assets would exceed price ination by 3.7% per annum and salary increases would exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum.
However, to measure the pension cost in accordance with SSAP 24, the following actuarial assumptions have been used: a rate of return on assets of 3.95% above ination and a rate of increase in earnings of 1.5% above ination.
The funding shortfall disclosed is being spread over 10 years, representing the average expected future working lives of scheme members, using the straight line method.
The cumulative excess of the groups contributions over pension cost at 31 December 2004 amounted to 0.2 million 2003: 0.1 million.
An amount of 0.1 million has therefore been credited to the profit and loss account in the current year in respect of this movement and is included within the group charge for pension costs for this scheme for the year of 3.2 million 2003: 1.7 million.
Throughout the year, the group has paid contributions to the pension scheme of 2.6 times member contributions, together with supplementary contributions of 2.2 million based on the shortfall determined by the actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004.
From April 2005 the company will make contributions to the pension scheme of 3.4 times member contributions, in addition to the supplementary shortfall contributions of 2.2 million per annum.
Members have contributed at the rate of either 3% or 5% of pensionable salaries, depending on their membership status, throughout the accounting period.
The group also operates dened contribution personal pension schemes for new employees and existing employees who are not members of the dened benefit pension scheme.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes is the contributions payable of 1.3 million 2003: 0.8 million.
FRS 17 Retirement benets As noted above, the group operates a dened benefit pension scheme for certain staff.
The scheme is funded and is contracted out of the state second tier of pension provision.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
However, as the contributing membership reduces, pensionable payroll is expected to reduce over the longer term, and this is likely to more than offset the rising contribution rate.
The last formal valuation of the scheme was performed as at 31 March 2004 by a professionally qualied actuary.
In addition, and in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benets, a funding review of the scheme was carried out by the independent qualied actuary as at 31 December 2004.
The following information, in respect of the dened benefit scheme, is provided for disclosure purposes only, as required by FRS 17.
At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December The financial assumptions used to calculate the schemes liabilities 2004 2003 2002 under FRS 17 are as follows: % p. a.

It is not possible to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the Fund relating to individual participating employer companies.
As such, in accordance with FRS 17, the company will account for its liability to the Fund as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
Thus no disclosure of the balance sheet position will be made and the charge to profit and loss under FRS 17 will represent the actual contributions paid by the company.
The rates of contribution are as shown above and are the same for all participating employers.
56 Cattles plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the Accounts 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held note 13 which are treated, for this purpose, as being cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.

The book value of deferred consideration is discounted, in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting, and therefore equates to fair value.
The fair values of longer term bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings and related financial hedging instruments are estimated by discounting the associated future cash ows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December 2004.
