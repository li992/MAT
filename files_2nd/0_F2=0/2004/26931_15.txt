Accounting policies i Basis of preparation The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investments, and are in accordance with section 230 of, and schedule 4 to, the Companies Act 1985 and with applicable accounting standards and the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in January 2003. ii Income Income from equity investments, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Where the Company elects to receive dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the equivalent of the cash dividend is recognised as income in the revenue statement and any excess in value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserve realised.
Interest income and expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
iii Expenditure and finance costs Expenses and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged wholly to the revenue statement.
iv Profits and losses in subsidiary undertakings Profits and losses arising from investment dealing are dealt with in the revenue statement.
v Foreign currency translation All transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the dates of such transactions.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that date.
Exchange differences arising on the revaluation of investments held as fixed assets are included in capital reserve unrealised.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities are taken to capital reserve realised: such differences in the subsidiary undertakings are taken to the revenue statement.
vi Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results, as stated in the financial statements, which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
vii Investments Listed investments are valued at closing middle market or last traded prices, where appropriate, on recognised stock exchanges ruling on the balance sheet date.
The subsidiary undertakings are carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors using primary valuation methodologies such as earnings multiples, recent transactions and net assets.
Where fair value cannot reliably be measured the investment will be carried at the previous reporting date value unless there is evidence that the investment has since been impaired.
In such a case the value will be reduced to reflect the estimated extent of impairment.

The fully diluted net asset value per share of 238.87p was calculated by adjusting equity shareholders funds for consideration receivable on the exercise of all warrants and dividing by the total number of shares that would have been in issue at 31 December 2004 had all the warrants been exercised.
The calculation of the fully diluted revenue and capital returns per ordinary share are carried out in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
For the purposes of calculating diluted revenue and capital returns per ordinary share, the number of ordinary shares is the weighted average used in the basis calculation plus the number of ordinary shares deemed to be issued for no consideration on exercise of all warrants by reference to the average price of the ordinary shares during the year.
No fully diluted revenue and capital returns have been disclosed as the calculations indicate that the warrants do not have a potentially dilutive effect for this year.
The Company made a bonus issue of warrants on 26 March 2004, full details of which are given in Note 23.

Derivatives and financial instruments Background The Groups financial instruments, other than derivative contracts, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations, for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement and debtors for accrued income, short term debtors and creditors.
The Group has little exposure to credit and cash flow risk.
Any unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
This risk is taken into account by the directors when arriving at their valuation of these items.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: market price risk, i. e. movements in the value of investment holdings caused by factors other than interest rate and currency movements: foreign currency risk, use of derivatives: and interest rate risk The Investment Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
Policy i Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Further information on the investment portfolio and investment policy is set out in the Investment Managers report.
ii Foreign Currency Risk A substantial proportion of the Groups portfolio is invested in overseas securities and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of investment portfolio, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
iii Interest Rate Risk The Group is able to take advantage of a floating rate overdraft facility.
At the year end the group had borrowings of 13,552,000 and US$11,999,000 6,250,000. iv Use of Derivatives contracts The Group has entered into a variety of different derivative contracts during the year.
Guidelines agreed with the Investment Manager limit any exposure to options, futures and contracts for differences to a maximum of 10% of the Groups gross assets.
