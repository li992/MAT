Short term debtors and creditors are excluded from disclosure as allowed by FRS13.
The main risks arising from the companys financial instruments are market price risk and currency risk.
Market price risk The companys exposure to market price risk comprises of changes in interest rates, valuations awarded to equities, movements in prices and liquidity of financial instruments.
As the companys objective is to track the index, the company does not increase the level of cash balances through the sale of equities.
Foreign currency risk The companys portfolio is invested in US quoted securities, and therefore US dollar exchange rate movements can significantly affect the sterling value of the portfolio.
The company does not hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of the portfolio.
Financial assets and liabilities The fixed asset investments see note 8 are valued at middle market prices, which equates to their fair value.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities are represented by their carrying values in the balance sheet.
