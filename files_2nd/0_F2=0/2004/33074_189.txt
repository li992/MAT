C11742 Unlvr AR eng 102-121. qxd 9 3 05 12:57 AM Page 120 Notes to the consolidated accounts Unilever Group 16 Financial instruments The Group has comprehensive policies in place, approved by the Directors, covering the use of derivative financial instruments.
These instruments are used for hedging purposes.
Established controls are in place covering all financial instruments.
These include policies, guidelines, exposure limits, a system of authorities and independent reporting.
Performance is closely monitored with independent reviews undertaken by internal audit.
The accounting policies governing these instruments are in line with generally accepted practice in the UK and the Netherlands and follow hedge accounting principles described in the accounting policies on page 98.
The use of leveraged instruments is not permitted.
Details of the instruments used for interest rate and foreign exchange exposure management, together with information on related exposures, are given below.
Except for the description of Unilevers currency exposures as included on page 51 on treasury risks, all debtors and trade and other creditors other than for finance lease creditors and provisions have been excluded from the analysis below and from the interest rate and currency proles in note 14 on page 117 and note 15 on page 118 either due to the exclusion of short-term items, as permitted by United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 13, or because the amounts are not material.
Unilevers interest rate management policy is described on page 51.
The Groups financial position is mainly xed by xed rate long-term debt issues and straightforward derivative financial instruments, such as interest rate swaps.
In general, cash is invested short-term at oating interest rates.
At the end of 2004, interest rates were xed on approximately 54% of the projected net debt for 2005 and 36% of the projected net debt for 2006 compared with 61% for 2004 and 62% for 2005 at the end of 2003.
Nominal values of interest rate derivative instruments are shown in the table below.
These nominal values do not reect the actual level of use of financial instruments when compared with the nominal value of the underlying debt.
This is because certain financial instruments have consecutive strike and maturity dates on the same underlying debt in different time periods.
Whilst the nominal amounts reect the volume of activity, they are not indicative of the amount of credit risk to which the Group is exposed.

The market value of these instruments at the end of 2004 represented a recognised unrealised gain of 440 million 2003: gain of 793 million which was largely offset by recognised unrealised losses on the underlying assets and liabilities.

At the end of 2004, some 82% 2003: 90% of Unilevers total capital and reserves were denominated in the currencies of the two parent companies, euros and sterling.
Our policy for the management of counterparty exposures is set out on page 51.
Master netting agreements are in place for the majority of interest rate derivative instruments.
The risk in the event of default by a counterparty is determined by the extent to which market prices have moved since the contracts were made.
The Group believes that the risk of incurring such losses is remote.
The following table summarises the fair values and carrying amounts of the various classes of financial instruments as at 31 December: million million million million Carrying Carrying Fair value Fair value amount amount 2004 2003 2004 2003 Financial assets Other xed investments 161 146 148 143 Current investments 1 016 1 491 1 016 1 491 Cash at bank and in hand 1 587 1 854 1 587 1 854 2 764 3 491 2 751 3 488 Financial liabilities Bank loans and overdrafts 1 583 1 834 1 583 1 834 Bonds and other loans 10 907 14 705 10 465 14 066 Finance lease creditors 218 218 12 708 16 539 12 266 15 900 Derivatives Interest rate swaps assets 104 189 58 113 liabilities 11 61 1 Foreign exchange contracts: assets 551 984 551 984 liabilities 111 191 111 191 The fair values of listed xed investments are based on their market values.
The fair values of unlisted xed investments and finance leases are not materially different from their carrying amounts.
The carrying amount of current investments is based on their market value.
Cash, bank loans and overdrafts have fair values which approximate to their carrying amounts because of their short-term nature.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts represent the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year-end exchange rates.
The fair values of bonds and other loans, interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements are based on the net present value of the anticipated future cash ows associated with these instruments.
Short-term debtors and creditors other than finance lease creditors and provisions have fair values which approximate to their carrying values and are therefore not included in the table.
In November 2001, NV entered into a forward purchase contract with a counterparty bank to buy 10 000 000 PLC shares at 559p per share in November 2006.
If the PLC share price falls by more than 5% below 559p, cash collateral for the difference must be placed with the counterparty bank.
At 31 December 2004 24 million 2003: 20 million was so deposited and reported under cash at bank with repayment notice required.
At 31 December 2004 the market value of the forward purchase contract was 14 million 2003: 11 million.
Counterparties have deposited securities with a market value of 589 million 2003: 832 million as collateral for their obligations in respect of derivative financial instruments.
Such collateral is not regarded as an asset of Unilever and is excluded from the balance sheet.
Currency exposures Unilevers foreign exchange policies are described on page 51.
Compliance with the Groups policies means that the net amount of monetary assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 that are exposed to currency uctuations is not material.
Commodity contracts Unilever purchases forward contracts to hedge future requirements for certain raw materials, almost always for physical delivery.
Futures contracts may also be used to hedge future price movements, however the amounts are not material.
