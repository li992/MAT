Exceptional items are those items within ordinary activities which, because of their size or nature, are disclosed to give a proper understanding of the underlying result for the period.
These include restructuring charges in connection with reorganising businesses comprising impairment of xed assets, costs of severance, and other costs directly attributable to the restructuring, and profits and losses on disposal of businesses.
United Kingdom FRS 3 would require profits and losses on disposal of most businesses to be excluded from operating profit.
However, because the business disposals above and the restructuring costs are part of a series of linked initiatives under the Path to Growth strategy, separate presentation would not give a true and fair view and therefore we have included all exceptional items arising from these initiatives on a single line in operating profit.
Costs associated with restructuring, such as training, are recognised as they arise and are not treated as exceptional.
Restructuring charges and business disposals relate primarily to a series of linked initiatives the Path to Growth, announced on 22 February 2000 to align the organisation behind plans for accelerating growth and expanding margins and to restructuring arising from the integration of Bestfoods.
The total net cost of these programmes has been 6.4 billion over five years, most of which has been exceptional restructuring costs 5.4 billion.
In 2004, 0.9 billion of net costs were included in Path to Growth programmes, of which 0.8 billion is exceptional.
Goodwill impairment includes a charge of 591 million taken for the impairment of goodwill for Slim Fast.
Details of the impairment are included in Note 9 Goodwill and intangible assets on page 113.
An additional goodwill impairment charge has been made for businesses in advance of planned disposals.
Other exceptional items in 2004 represent a charge of 169 million relating to the potential repayment of certain sales tax credits in Brazil.
In 2003, 0.3 billion of net costs were incurred under Path to Growth programmes, of which a net 0.1 billion was exceptional.
In 2002, exceptional items included 1.1 billion of Path to Growth net costs.
Other exceptional items in 2002 included the release of provisions 98 million against environmental exposures when events showed that the provisions were no longer required.
These provisions were originally recorded on the acquisition of the Bestfoods business.
Information relating to the cash ows arising from restructuring is given in note 20 on page 130.
Information relating to business disposals is given in note 26 on page 135.
