The actual rate at which deferred tax will be applied to any valuation deficits or surpluses which exists when FRS 17 is fully implemented will depend on the Groups deferred tax position at that time.
In calculating that rate, management will have regard to the then projected future profitability of its businesses, including projected costs associated with its pension and other postemployment obligations, and the impact which those projections will have on the Groups ability to recover any deferred tax assets which exist when FRS 17 is implemented.
As set out in note 20, at 31 December 2004 the Group had deferred tax assets unrecognised of 262.1m based on a five-year projection of the Groups profitability.
The Groups current pension and other post-employment liabilities will be recognised over approximately the next 12 years.
Therefore, on full implementation of FRS 17, a longer-term projection of Group profitability than that currently used will need to be considered in order to fully assess the deferred tax consequences of FRS 17 valuation results.
