SEGMENTAL INFORMATION A Classes of business The Group has two classes of business: Retailing and Financial Services.

The key areas affected by the adoption of the new guidance are as follows: a provision for customer returns has now been made representing the Groups cumulative estimate of the amount of merchandise sold during the year which will be returned and refunded in the following year: staff discounts, previously reported as part of employee costs, have been reclassied and are now deducted from turnover: and discounts provided to certain customers at Kings Super Markets, previously reported as a deduction from gross margin, have been reclassied as deductions from turnover.
These changes have been accounted for by way of a prior year adjustment and previously reported gures have been restated accordingly.
The impact of adopting the new policy for the current financial year is to reduce turnover by 49.8m with a negligible impact on profit before tax.
The impact of adopting the policy for the year ended 29 March 2003 was to reduce turnover by 58.1m and profit before tax by 3.4m.
1 Operating profit for Financial Services includes 9.3m of merchant fee income last year 14.1m arising on Marks & Spencer Chargecard transactions.
This fee is payable by UK Retail and has been deducted in arriving at UK Retail operating profit.

VAT on UK Retail turnover was 755.7m last year 734.3m.
Since last year end, 138.0m of gifts have been reclassied to be included within Home.
Certain other product lines have also been reclassied to reect management responsibility.
As a result of this change, comparative gures have been restated.
3 Turnover from continuing operations originates in the following geographical segments: United Kingdom 7,783.4m last year 7,500.5m and International 518.1m last year 518.6m.
4 The value of goods exported from the UK, including shipments to international subsidiaries, amounted to 293.0m last year 271.6m.

EARNINGS PER SHARE The calculation of earnings per ordinary share is based on earnings after tax, minority interests and non-equity dividends, and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
An adjusted earnings per share gure has been calculated in addition to the earnings per share required by FRS 14 Earnings per Share and is based on earnings excluding the effect of the exceptional items.
It has been calculated to allow shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.

C United Kingdom Share Incentive Plan and Republic of Ireland profit Share Scheme The Company has adopted the free share element of the new all-employee Share Incentive Plan, which is approved by the Inland Revenue.
This is a discretionary plan and the Company will decide each year whether an award is to be made, depending upon the year-end profits.
The Republic of Ireland profit Sharing Scheme remains unchanged.
No award will be made in July 2004 in respect of the financial year ended 3 April 2004.
Last year, an award of 8.8m, representing 2.0% of the earnings of 53,418 eligible employees with a maximum award of approximately 220 was made.
These shares are purchased in the market: 2,556,366 ordinary shares were purchased by the profit Sharing Trustees in respect of the 2002 03 allocation.
D United Kingdom Employees Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme Under the terms of the Scheme, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company once in each financial year to those employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered is 80% of the market price for three consecutive dealing days preceding the date of offer.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the SAYE contract, either three, five or seven years after entering the Scheme.
EMPLOYEES continued E Executive Share Option Schemes Under the terms of the current Scheme, approved by shareholders in 2002, the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to executive directors and senior employees at the market price on a date to be determined prior to the date of the offer.
No further options may be granted under the 1984, 1987 and 1997 Schemes.
Outstanding options under each of the 1984 and 1987 Schemes continue to be bound by the Maximum Option Value which is limited to four times remuneration on exercise further details are set out in the Remuneration Report on page 17.
EMPLOYEES continued F Executive Share Matching Plan An Executive Share Matching Plan for senior management was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 2002 and was introduced for the first time in July 2002.
The plan currently operates for around 25 members of senior management.
Participants are required to invest one-third of any annual bonus earned in shares in the Company.
The balance of the annual bonus may be invested voluntarily.
The pre-tax value of the invested bonus will be matched by an award of shares, with the extent of the match determined by performance conditions over a three-year period.
Further details of the plan are given in the Remuneration Report on page 17.
0.5m last year 0.5m has been charged against profits for this year.
RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benets in full for the year ended 3 April 2004.
For the year ended 29 March 2003, the Group accounted for retirement benets under SSAP 24 and gave disclosures under the FRS 17 transitional arrangements.
The total cost of retirement benets for the Group was 139.0m last year 104.8m under FRS 17 of which 123.8m last year 131.8m has been charged against operating profit and 15.2m last year a credit of 27.0m has been charged within other finance charges.
If the Group had continued to account for retirement benets under SSAP 24, the total Group cost would have been 182.2m last year 146.4m.
The SSAP 24 cost would have been higher this year when compared to last year because it includes the impact of the full actuarial valuation of the UK dened benefit pension scheme at 31 March 2003 see below.
Within the total Group retirement benefit cost of 139.0m, 130.7m relates to the UK dened benefit pension scheme.
The Group also operates small dened benefit pension schemes in the Republic of Ireland and at Kings Super Markets in the USA.
Retirement benets also includes a UK post-retirement healthcare scheme and unfunded pension plans.
Contributions to non-dened benefit pension schemes in the year were 2.3m last year 5.7m.
These are included in note e. a A full actuarial valuation of the UK dened benefit pension scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 and showed a 39 deficit of 585m.
This valuation, and the most recent actuarial valuations of the other post-retirement schemes, have been updated by independent qualied actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 3 April 2004.
The FRS 17 data for 2003 and 2002 has been restated to include the dened benefit pension scheme at Kings Super Markets.
