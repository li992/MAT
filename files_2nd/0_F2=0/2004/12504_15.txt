40 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Basis of preparation and consolidation Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom UK GAAP, under the historical cost convention, except for the departure from Financial Reporting Standard 6 Acquisitions and disposals FRS 6 described below and the revaluation of freehold land and buildings carried out before the implementation of Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible xed assets FRS 15 as described in note 13.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Premier Foods plc the Company.
The profits and losses of the subsidiary undertakings are included from the effective date of acquisition until the effective date of disposal.
On 22 June 2004, Premier Foods plc was incorporated with an issued share capital of 5,000,000 1p ordinary shares.
Premier Foods plc became the ultimate holding company of the Group on 15 July 2004.
On this date, HMTF Premier Limited HMTFPL contributed its shares in Premier Foods Investment No.
3 to Premier Foods plc in exchange for 1,000 1p ordinary shares in Premier Foods plc.
The scheme of arrangement has been accounted for as a Group reconstruction in accordance with the principles of merger accounting.
FRS 6 requires acquisition accounting to be adopted where all of the conditions laid down by merger accounting are not satisfied.
One of the requirements of merger accounting under Schedule 4A 10 1 of the Companies Act 1985 is that at least 90% of the consideration calculated by reference to the nominal value of shares issued should be in the form of equity shares.
3 acquired, through its wholly owned subsidiary undertakings Premier Foods Investments No.
2 and Premier Foods Investments No.
1, the entire share capital of Premier Foods Investments Limited and its subsidiaries by the issue of one 1 ordinary share to HMTFPL and the assumption of 194.4m of loan notes due 2017 to Premier Investments Holdings L. P. The obligations under the loan notes constituted more than 10% of the total consideration.
As a result of the transactions executed on 23 January 2004, the shareholders in PFI No.
3 were the same as the former shareholders of Premier Foods Investments Limited, the ultimate parent company at 31 December 2003 and the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, were unchanged.
Consequently, the directors have considered that to record the Group reconstruction as an acquisition by PFI No.
3, to attribute fair values to the assets and liabilities of PFI No.
2 and Premier Foods Investments Limited, and to reect in each case only the post Group reconstruction consolidated results of the Group within the consolidated financial statements would fail to give a true and fair view of the Groups consolidated results and financial position.
Accordingly, having regard to the overriding requirement under Section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 for the consolidated financial statements to give a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position, the directors have adopted merger accounting principles in respect of the Group reconstruction in drawing up the financial statements underlying the consolidated financial statements.
As a result, all equity shares that were outstanding at the date of the Group reconstruction have, together with all disclosures, been restated and presented throughout the period of the consolidated financial statements to give the effect of the Group reconstruction as if it had occurred immediately prior to the beginning of the period.
The directors have considered it is not practicable to quantify the effect of this departure from FRS 6.
The results of the companies acquired under the Group reconstruction on 15 July 2004 was a profit of 8.6m for the year ended 31 December 2003 and a loss of 4.0m for the period from 1 January 2004 to 15 July 2004.
Accounting policies Turnover Turnover is the value of sales, excluding transactions with or between wholly owned subsidiaries, after deduction of sales rebates, discounts, value added tax and other taxes directly attributable to turnover.
Sales are recognised upon receipt of conrmation that the goods shipped have been accepted by the customer, where the sales price is xed and collectability is reasonably assured.
Shipping and handling costs are included in selling and distribution costs.
Sales rebates and discounts Sales rebates and discounts reserves are established based on managements best estimate of the amounts necessary to meet claims by the Groups customers in respect of these discounts and rebates.
The provision is made at the time of sale and released, if unutilised, after assessment that the likelihood of such a claim being made has become remote.

Accounting policies continued Depreciation Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long and short leasehold property is amortised over the terms of the leases from the date the property is brought into use.
Other xed assets are depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to reduce them to their estimated residual value.
Such estimated useful lives are: Freehold land Not depreciated Freehold buildings 20 to 50 years Vehicles, plant and machinery 3 to 15 years When properties are revalued, the depreciation thereafter provided is based on the revalued depreciable amounts.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill FRS 11, where assets are impaired, write-downs are charged initially against any related revaluation reserve until historic cost is reached unless they are caused by a clear consumption of economic benets.
Goodwill and intangible assets Purchased goodwill, being the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the separable net assets of businesses acquired, is capitalised and amortised over the shorter of its estimated useful life and 20 years on a straight-line basis.
Prior to 1998 before the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets FRS 10, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired prior to 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the gross amount of any related goodwill previously taken to reserves.
Acquired trademarks that are controlled through custody or legal rights and could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured.
Trademarks are amortised on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful economic life and 20 years.
Asset impairment Intangible and tangible xed assets are tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised, in the profit and loss account, to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and at any time when the directors believe that impairment may have occurred.
Fixed asset investments Investments held as xed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment in their value.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Leasing Payments under operating leases are charged wholly to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
Where a leasehold property has ceased to be used for the purpose of the business, full provision is made for the future rental costs of the property less any sublet income.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
No interest is included but, where appropriate, cost includes production and other attributable overhead expenses.
Cost is calculated on a first-in-first-out basis by reference to the invoiced value of supplies and attributable costs of bringing stock to its present location and condition.

Accounting policies continued Foreign currency translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
The results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange ruling during the year.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at year-end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign subsidiary undertakings, less exchange differences on borrowings that finance or provide a hedge against those subsidiary undertakings, are taken to reserves through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Taxation The charge credit for taxation is based on the profit loss for the year and takes into account deferred taxation.
The Group provides in full for deferred tax arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their inclusion in tax computations to the extent that a liability or an asset is expected to be payable or recoverable in the foreseeable future.
The Group has chosen not to discount its deferred tax liability.
Pension costs The Group currently operates a number of pension schemes, principally the Premier Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded dened benets scheme.
There is a further funded dened benets scheme, the Premier Ambient Products Pension Scheme PAPPS.
In addition there are a small number of company dened contribution schemes.
Pension costs are recognised and measured in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs SSAP 24.
The pension costs relating to the Group pension schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries.
The amounts so determined include the regular cost of providing the benets as a percentage of current and expected future earnings of the employees covered.
Variations from the regular pension cost are spread on a systematic basis over the estimated average remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
A proportion of the employees of the Group companies are members of a number of dened benefit pension schemes.
Each of the Groups operating companies directly funds the schemes based on the actual pension cost for its employees in accordance with the funding levels as determined by the schemes actuaries.
Payments to the Groups dened contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
Post retirement benets The Group provides certain additional post retirement and unfunded pension benets principally for employees in mainland Europe.
The estimated cost of providing such benets is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the employees working lives within the Group.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those that need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence.
Such items are included within operating profit unless they represent profits or losses on the sale or termination of an operation, costs of a fundamental reorganisation or restructuring having a material affect on the nature and focus of the Groups business, or profits or losses on the disposal of xed assets.
Cash and liquid resources Short-term cash deposits, which can be called on demand without any material penalty are included within cash balances in the balance sheets and consolidated cash ow statement.

Accounting policies continued Debt issuance costs Costs relating to the issuance of debt are offset against the carrying value of the related debt and amortised over the term in which management expect the debt to be repaid, in line with the level of the debt, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 4 Capital instruments FRS 4.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments utilised by the Group comprise interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and currency options.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk prole of an underlying exposure faced by the Group.
Interest rate swap settlements are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the term of the underlying instrument and exchange gains or losses are recognised on the maturity of the underlying transaction in the profit and loss account.

Employees continued Pension commitments Background The Group companies participate in a number of pension schemes, principally the Premier Foods Pension Scheme, which is a funded dened benefit scheme.
The Premier Foods Pension Scheme formerly known as the HF Pension Scheme comprise the assets and liabilities of the Premier Brands Pension Fund and the Hillsdown Foods Group Pension Scheme, which were transferred to the Premier Foods Pension Scheme on merger of the three schemes on 21 May 2004.
There is also a further funded dened benefit scheme, PAPPS.
There are in addition a small number of company dened contribution schemes, personal pension schemes and life assurance only arrangements.
The scheme funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Groups nances.
The dened benefit schemes invest in a mixture of United Kingdom and European equities and corporate and government bonds.
Actuarial assessments The total pension cost for the Group in the periods has been assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The last formal actuarial assessments of the Premier Foods Pension Scheme and the PAPPS were undertaken as at 21 May 2004 and as at 31 December 2004 respectively.
As at the date of the actuarial assessments, at 31 December 2004 and 2003, the actuarial value of the assets were sufficient to cover 95% and 95% respectively of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for future salary increases.
The market value of assets at the valuation dates used for scheme funding and accounting purposes were 303.7m and 273.3m respectively.
The principal actuarial assumptions were that the rate of discount of liabilities is 3% more than wage ination and 4% more than pension increases.
Allowance was made for pensions in payment to increase as required by statute and in accordance with the rules of the schemes, and also to reect the Groups investment policies.
Assets were valued using a discounted dividend approach.
The significant assumption used in this assessment was that future investment returns would be 7% per annum.
Assets have been taken at market values at the valuation dates and the year-end.
For accounting purposes in previous years assets had been valued using a discounted dividend approach.
The market value of the assets at 31 December 2004 was 303.7m.
The actuarial valuation of the Premier Foods Pension Scheme has been updated to 31 December 2004 for assessment of the pension cost.
The normal cost of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes was 3.9m and 4.1m in the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively, which, after interest on the recognised surplus and amortisation of the remaining unrecognised surplus, resulted in a net dened benefit pensions expense of 5.3m and 4.3m in the respective years.
Contributions The Group contributed a total of 18.6m to the Premier Foods Pension Scheme including amounts contributed to the HF Pension Scheme, the Premier Brands Pension Fund and the Hillsdown Foods Group Pension Scheme prior to the merger in the year ended 31 December 2004.
The Group contributed 0.4m to the PAPPS in the year ended 31 December 2004.
The Group contributed 2.2m to the Hillsdown Foods Group Pension Scheme in the year ended 31 December 2003.
In the six month period to 30 June 2003 the Group did not contribute to the HF Pension Scheme and the Premier Brands Pension Fund, due to the schemes surplus at that time.
The Group recommenced contributions to the schemes from July 2003, paying 1.6m and accruing 0.3m in contributions to 31 December 2003.
Contributions to the PAPPS in the year ended 31 December 2003 amounted to 0.5m.
Pension prepayment and provisions The pension prepayment in respect of the HF Pension Scheme and the Premier Brands Pension Fund at 31 December 2004 and 2003 was 9.1m and 5.8m respectively.
The increase in prepayment of 3.3m was primarily due to an increase of cash contributions in the year to reduce fund deficits.
The reduction in the prepayment of 2.4m in the year ended 31 December 2003 is due to the net dened benefit pensions expense exceeding the cash contributions paid.
A provision of 7.2m in respect of the Hillsdown Foods Group Pension Scheme was held at 31 December 2003, which represented the estimated scheme deficit upon Premier Foods Holdings Limited becoming principal employer for the scheme less cash contributions made to the scheme.
This provision was fully utilised following the merger of the pension schemes in May 2004.
52 Premier Foods plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements 7.
Employees continued Mainland Europe post retirement and unfunded pension benets The Group also operates plans in mainland Europe, which provide employees with certain post retirement and unfunded pension benets.
The liabilities in respect of these benets amounted to 0.1m and 0.2m in the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
The costs of these plans were 0.4m in the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
Dened contribution schemes The cost of the dened contribution schemes was 0.4m and 0.3m for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
FRS 17 Retirement benefit disclosures Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets FRS 17 introduces a completely different approach to accounting for dened benefit pension schemes.
At each period end the pension scheme assets are measured at market value, the pension scheme liabilities are measured at a present value using a specified actuarial valuation method and discounted at a corporate bond rate, and the resulting surplus or deficit would be shown on the Groups balance sheet.
FRS 17 redenes what should be reported as operating costs, including an annual current service cost which is no longer reduced or increased by spreading forward surpluses or deficits.
The expected return on scheme assets less the notional interest cost on the scheme liabilities is included as other finance costs or income adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses from period to period are to be recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
FRS 17 requires that where accounting periods end after 22 June 2001 additional disclosure is required in order to provide adequate future data comparatives when FRS 17 is fully implemented.
The gures below are consolidated gures including both the Premier Foods Pension Scheme and the PAPPS.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 21 May 2004 for the Premier Foods Pension Scheme and updated to 31 December 2004 by a qualied independent actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the Scheme at 31 December 2004.

Under the Senior Credit Facility, a syndicate of financial institutions made 380.0m of credit facilities available to the Group.
The Senior Credit Facility comprise i 175.8m Term A facilities and ii 204.2m Term B facilities.
In addition an Acquisition Facility has been made available, which is a multi currency revolving credit facility of 200.0m or its equivalent in other currencies.
The final maturity date of the above arrangements is 20 July 2009.

On 23 July 2004 the Secured Credit Facility and Acquisition Facility were replaced by a combination of the Senior Credit Facility Term A see note a and the primary proceeds raised on IPO.
On 23 July 2004 ordinary shares were issued to capitalise the Unsecured Unguaranteed Loan Notes see note 22 iii.
The Unsecured Subordinated Senior Notes were repaid on 1 September 2004 using the Senior Credit Facility Term B see note a.
Financial instruments The main risks facing the Group arise from adverse movements in interest rates and foreign currency, along with a shortage of liquidity and credit.
The Group uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.
The management of these risks, along with the day to day management of treasury activities is performed by the Group treasury department.
The policy framework governing the management of these risks is established by the Treasury Committee, which is a sub-committee appointed by the Companys Board of Directors.
The policies toward these risks are documented and reviewed on a regular basis by the Treasury Committee.
The framework for management of these risks is set down in the Treasury policies and procedures manual.
The Group also enters into contracts with suppliers for its principal raw materials, some of which are considered commodities.
These contracts are part of the Groups normal purchasing activities, which always result in receipt of raw materials.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows principally in pounds sterling at oating rates of interest and seeks to mitigate the effect of adverse movements in interest rates by entering into derivative financial instruments.
The Group actively monitors its interest rate exposure, since the high level of debt makes its profitability sensitive to movements in interest rates.
However, the minimum interest rate hedging that must be maintained is governed by the hedging strategy letter, which forms part of the Senior Credit Facility see note 19 a.
The Group makes use of a variety of derivative instruments including interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure.
The Senior Credit Facility requires the Group to hedge a minimum of 50% of its Term debt for a period of two years.
Foreign exchange risk The Group reports its financial statements in pounds sterling and trades in several non-sterling currencies, primarily Euros and US dollars.
Its trading transactions are therefore subject to the effect of movements in these currencies.
Such exposures arise from sales or purchases in currencies other than the units functional currency.
Management of the major exposures is centralised and managed by the Groups treasury department.
It is Groups policy to hedge exposure using forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency options.
Although the Group generates some of its profits in non-sterling currencies and has assets in non-sterling jurisdictions, the translation exposure resulting from these profits and overseas net assets is not considered material and is currently not hedged.
This matter is reviewed regularly the Treasury Committee.
Liquidity risk The Group has negotiated facilities with its bankers that provide sufficient headroom to ensure liquidity and continuity of funding.
It therefore has sufficient unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowing capacity.
The Group tends to have significant uctuations in its short-term borrowing position due to seasonal factors: however, the revolving credit facilities are set at a level sufficient to meet its projected peak borrowing requirements.
Credit risk Potential concentrations of credit risk to the Group consist principally of cash and cash equivalents and trade receivables.
Cash and cash equivalents are deposited with high-credit quality financial institutions.
Trade receivables are due principally from major grocery retailers, however, it is the Groups policy to insure all third-party trade debt.
The Group does not consider there to be any significant concentration of credit risk at 31 December 2004.
Short-term debtors and creditors Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk disclosures.

In addition the Group has pension prepayment and other debtors due after more than one year see note 16 of 9.4m and 6.5m at 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
No interest is earned on these balances.
Interest rate risk prole of financial liabilities The interest rate risk prole of the Groups financial liabilities debt before issuance costs after taking account of the interest rate swaps used to manage the interest prole was: Floating rate Fixed rate financial liabilities financial liabilities Total m m m Currency Sterling 270.1 464.1 734.2 Euro 1.1 1.1 US dollar 0.2 0.2 At 31 December 2003 271.4 464.1 735.5 Sterling 200.0 190.0 390.0 Euro US dollar At 31 December 2004 200.0 190.0 390.0 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the denition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions and other creditors due after more than one year of 2.6m and 13.4m, as at 31 December 2004 and 2003, respectively for restructuring, unfunded pension liabilities, post retirement benets and other liabilities met the denition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities were considered to be oating rate financial liabilities.
This is because, in establishing the provisions, the cash ows are discounted where material.
Fixed rate financial liabilities Weighted average Weighted average period for which interest rate rate is xed % Years Currency: Sterling At 31 December 2004 4.93 2.88 At 31 December 2003 8.97 4.55 The above calculation of the xed rate weighted average interest rates excludes any borrowing margin as the derivative instruments used to x the interest rates are not allocated specically against the Term A and Term B facilities of the Senior Credit Facility see note 19 a, which in turn would determine the applicable margin.
The level of oating rate borrowings are determined by reference to the Senior Credit Facility.
The pricing basis for all oating rate borrowings is LIBOR.

The foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements have been marked to their fair values at the balance sheet date.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities that are hedged using currency swaps are translated initially at the swap rates.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in exchange rates are included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
Changes in the value of the swap as a result of changes in interest rates are not included in the book value of the relevant asset or liability.
All commodity contracts are settled by physical delivery and are not held for trading purposes.
There were no significant gains or losses on contracts at the balance sheet dates that were expected to be shown in the income statement in the following year.

Financial instruments continued Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate derivative products.
Currency risk using forward foreign currency contracts and currency options to hedge its net foreign currency debtors and creditors.
Forward foreign currency contracts and currency option contracts are also used for future anticipated foreign currency exposures for up to twenty-four months.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off-balance sheet unrecognised and on-balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which were included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.

Contingent liabilities Sudan 1 product recall On 18 February 2005, the Food Standards Agency initiated a recall of a number of products, which had been identied as possibly being contaminated with a dye Sudan 1 not authorised for use in food products.
The dye was traced to a batch of chilli powder supplied to the Group, which was used by the Group in the manufacture of Worcester sauce.
The Group used the Worcester sauce in the manufacture of three other products and supplied Worcester sauce to a number of retail and food ingredient customers.
A number of the Groups customers have indicated that they intend to claim for their costs associated with the product recall.
These claims may comprise claims for damage to their own products, the costs of recalling and destroying recovered product and claims for consequential loss among others.
Given the nature of the recall, the limited number of claims that have been received at this stage and the intrinsic uncertainty involved in such situations, it has not been possible to quantify fully the claims.
However, the Company has made a preliminary assessment of the quantum and nature of the claims based on a set of assumptions reecting managements current view of the situation and after having taken appropriate legal advice.
At this time, based on this assessment, its own insurance position and its potential claims against its suppliers and their own insurers, the Group does not believe that it has any material financial exposure.
Legal proceedings A claim for 658,000 has been made against Premier International Foods UK Limited by Exel UK Limited formerly known as Tibbett & Britten Limited Exel pursuant to indemnities due under an asset sale agreement the ASA.
Exel further claimed unquantified damages arising out of an alleged loss of revenue for business Exel claims it should have received under a related distribution agreement the DA.
The dispute between the parties regarding the ASA has effectively been settled and certain payments have been made in respect of the indemnities.
Premier International Foods UK Limited has challenged both the liability for the loss under the DA and the potential quantum of damages that the alleged loss of revenue is greatly exaggerated owing to errors in Exels calculations.
Premier International Foods UK Limited has asserted a counterclaim for breach of contract by Exel in connection with Exels obligations to manage pallets hired from GKN Chep under the DA.
A Case Management Conference was held on 15 December 2004 at which the trial timetable was set, providing for a trial during October and November 2005.
This action is ongoing and the directors consider that appropriate accounting provision has been made in respect of this matter.
