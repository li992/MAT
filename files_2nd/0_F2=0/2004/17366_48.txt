IFRS 1 exemptions Our 2004 financial statements IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards allows a number of exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS for those companies adopting IFRS for the first time.
WPP has taken advantage of certain of these exemptions as follows: Impact of IFRS on financial Financial instruments statements The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to apply IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: For the year ended 31 December 2004 Disclosure and Presentation in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.
UK GAAP has continued to be applied in accounting for financial instruments in this period.
The Group will adopt IAS 39 and IAS 32 with effect from 1 January 2005 and consequently restate the balance sheet at that date in accordance with the requirements of these standards, which will generally mean a recognition of financial instruments at fair value.

which has resulted in the recognition of intangible assets of 7 million at 31 December 2004 which would not qualify for recognition under UK GAAP.
These largely comprise corporate brand names.
Changes in presentation of financial statements The primary financial statements on pages 165 to 167 have been prepared substantially These intangibles are amortised over their useful economic lives, which vary depending on in accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements.
The most significant the individual characteristics of the intangibles concerned, but are no more than 10 years.
presentational differences arising from this change in format are as follows: The impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 is not material.
Under UK GAAP, capitalised computer software is included within tangible xed assets on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, only computer software that is integral to a related Income from associates item of hardware should be included as property, plant and equipment.
All other In the current income statement format, in accordance with UK GAAP, the Group capitalised computer software should be shown as an intangible asset.
separately presents its share of operating profit, interest, minority interests and tax from associate undertakings.
Under IAS 1, these results are aggregated into a single line in Accordingly, a reclassication of 24 million has been made in the 31 December 2004 the income statement.
The effect is to reduce reported profit before interest and taxes balance sheet from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets.
by 19 million in 2004, although there is no impact on earnings.
IAS 28 investments in associates IFRS requires equity accounting for associates losses to cease at the point that the Working capital facility carrying value of the net assets of the relevant associate are nil.
Further losses are only In the balance sheet, the Group has historically presented its working capital facility the accrued if the investor has a legal or constructive obligation for the losses.
The Group advance of cash nancing against which certain trade debts have been assigned as a has therefore ceased to recognise equity losses where the net assets of the associate deduction from debtors, in accordance with the linked presentation required by FRS 5 concerned are nil or negative, where appropriate.
This did not result in any impact on Reporting the substance of transactions.

and the cash advance is shown as a bank borrowing within creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
As a result of this change, net debt is restated to include this facility as a borrowing, whereas previously it was treated as a reduction in working capital.
The impact is to increase net debt at 31 December 2004 by 261 million to 561 million.
The cash ows IAS 10 events after the balance sheet date of the Group in 2004 are unaffected by this change.
There is also no change to the income IAS 10 does not permit dividends proposed after the balance sheet date to be recognised statement presentation of the charges on this facility which are included in finance costs.
as a liability at that date because they do not represent a present obligation as dened by IAS 27 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
The impact of this change is to exclude the final dividend of 62 million from the income Changes in accounting policies statement for the year ended 31 December 2004, but include the prior year final dividend of 52 million as an expense in 2004.
This results in a net increase in retained profit of IFRS 2 share-based payment 10 million.

For share awards other than stock options, the charge to the Groups income statement is based on the intrinsic value market value on grant date of the award, spread over the IAS 19 employee benets relevant performance period, in accordance with UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
The Group fully implemented the UK Accounting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benets IFRS 2 requires that share-based payments including share options are recognised in in 2001.

On the basis that the Amendment will be endorsed by the European IFRS 2 permits prospective adoption for grants made after November 2002, but the Group Commission in the future, the Group has not made any changes to its accounting policies has chosen to adopt IFRS 2 on a full retrospective basis, for all option and share award in respect of accounting for pensions.
grants as the resulting charge better reects the ongoing impact on the Group.
The impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 is an after-tax charge of 27 million.
IAS 32 and IAS 39 financial instruments Deferred tax is provided based upon the expected future tax deductions relating to shareThe Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to apply based payment transactions, and is recognised over the vesting period of the relevant IAS 32 and IAS 39 in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004.

deferred tax credit to the income statement of 2 million.
The Group will therefore adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 on 1 January 2005 and consequently restate the opening balance sheet at that date to an IFRS basis in compliance with these standards.
IFRS 3 business combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations The most significant impact on the income statement of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 at completed prior to 1 January 2004, an exemption permitted by IFRS 1.
1 January 2005 will be as follows: IFRS 3 prohibits amortisation of goodwill and instead requires annual impairment testing.
Under UK GAAP, WPP amortises a number of acquisitions where the life of the goodwill is Convertible bonds determined to be nite.
In the IFRS financial information presented, this amortisation has Under UK GAAP, convertible bonds are reported as a liability unless conversion actually been reversed from the date of transition and the relevant goodwill tested for impairment occurs, and no gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
Under IAS 32, classication of at 31 December 2004. such compound instruments is undertaken based on the substance of the contractual arrangements and, consequently, the Groups compound instruments will be split into liability The Group has also conducted an impairment review of goodwill at 1 January 2004, and equity elements, based on the fair value of the debt component at the date of issue.
in accordance with the requirements of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
The income statement charge for the finance cost will continue to be spread evenly over The impact on the income statement for the year ended 31 December 2004 is to the term of the bonds so that at redemption the liability equals the redemption value.
eliminate goodwill amortisation of 42.5 million.
No additional impairment of goodwill arose However, under IFRS the initial recognition of the liability is for a lower amount than at 1 January 2004, however there was additional impairment of 5 million for the year under UK GAAP and consequently the finance cost over the period is higher.
At 1 January 2005, the Group had in issue two convertible bonds: 450 million bond When the Group makes acquisitions, deferred tax assets are established in relation to maturing in April 2007 and $287.5 million bond maturing in January 2005.
The impact tax losses and other tax attributes to the extent that it is probable that they will be utilised on the 1 January 2005 transition balance sheet from these bonds will be: in the future.
If the performance and profits of acquisitions are higher than originally 98 million reclassication from debt to equity to separately account for the equity anticipated then the Group may recognise the additional tax benefit of unbooked tax element of the convertible bonds 69 million relating to the 450 million bond and attributes in the IFRS income statement.

relating to the $287.5 million bond.
Due to the better than expected performance of certain acquisitions in the year ended The impact on the income statement for the year ending 31 December 2005 is 31 December 2004 there was an additional goodwill adjustment of 13 million charged expected to be an increase in interest payable and similar charges of 14 million, in to operating profit relating to the utilisation of pre-acquisition tax attributes that previously relation to convertible bonds in issue at 1 January 2005 13.7 million relating to the could not be recognised due to insufficient evidence that they were recoverable.

Group expects the annual goodwill adjustment to be lower in the future.
The expected total interest charges for these bonds under IFRS for the year ending 31 December 2005 will be 30 million on the 450 million convertible and 0.5 million IAS 21 requires goodwill and fair value adjustments on acquisitions to be recorded in on the $287.5 million convertible.

resulted in a decrease in the carrying value of these assets at 31 December 2004 of 679 million, and an equivalent reduction in equity.
IFRS 1 has a further impact in that goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP is not recycled to the income statement in the event of the disposal of the business concerned.

The total IFRS income statement tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 is 135 million.
In accordance with IAS 28, income from associates and joint ventures is now shown net of tax.
A reconciliation from UK GAAP to IFRS tax charge is shown below.
Under IFRS there is a net reduction of 5 million in the tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 which is comprised as follows: m UK GAAP profit and loss account tax charge 140 Reclass of tax charge relating to associates and joint ventures 18 Deferred tax charge on unremitted earnings of associates and joint ventures 2 Deferred tax credit in relation to stock option expense 2 Tax charge in relation to the tax effect of share-based payments now credited to equity 9 Deferred tax charge relating to goodwill 2 Changes in accounting policies continued Other changes 2 IFRS Income statement tax charge 135 IAS 32 and IAS 39 financial instruments continued Hedging instruments The effect of the adjustments required under IFRS is to increase the Groups tax rate on The Group has a number of hedging instruments which were accounted for as hedges Headline PBT for the year ended 31 December 2004 to 27.6% as compared with 26.1% under UK GAAP during 2004.
On adoption of IAS 39, the Group will recognise these under UK GAAP.
The primary reason for the increase in tax rate is the reduction in IFRS hedging instruments at fair value in the balance sheet at 1 January 2005.
It is expected Headline PBT due to the additional income statement expense for stock options as the that subsequent movements in the fair value of these instruments will not have a majority of this expense cannot be tax effected.
The Groups estimate of tax rate on significant impact on the income statement for the year ending 31 December 2005 Headline PBT for 2005 and 2006 remains 28-30% excluding the impact of Grey.
The as they also qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39. introduction of IFRS does not impact the amount of cash tax paid by the Group.
From time to time, the Group uses certain short-term derivative financial instruments to IAS 12 requires deferred tax liabilities of 300 million to be recognised at 31 December mitigate interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks.

holding companies there is no tax basis in the brands themselves and therefore the resulting deferred tax liabilities are equal to the carrying value of the corporate brands tax IAS 12 income taxes effected at the appropriate tax rate.
The Group considers the appropriate tax rate to be IAS 12 requires deferred tax to be provided on all taxable temporary differences between the Groups combined US federal and state tax rate.
Normally recognition of these the book value and the tax base of assets and liabilities of the Group rather than timing deferred tax liabilities would result in a corresponding increase of goodwill in respect of differences under UK GAAP.
As a result, the Groups IFRS balance sheet at 31 December these acquisitions, however under the exemptions provided by IFRS 1 relating to business 2004 includes additional deferred tax assets of 11 million and deferred tax liabilities of combinations, the Group has not adjusted goodwill in respect of acquisitions before 1 17 million in respect of the differences between the carrying value and tax written down January 2004. value of goodwill in the Groups balance sheet.

At 1 January 2004 an asset of 3 million was recognised in respect of anticipated future tax deductions of share-based payments.
The 2004 IFRS income statement expense for stock options was 29 million.
Deferred tax of only 2 million is credited to the IFRS income statement in 2004: the majority of the expense cannot be tax effected due to either the expense not being deductible for tax purposes or the recognition of the asset being restricted by existing tax losses.
At 31 December 2004 a deferred tax asset of 3 million was held in the balance sheet as although the asset was increased by 2 million relating to the 2004 charge there were other adjustments, primarily the exercise of options, that reduced the asset by 2 million.
