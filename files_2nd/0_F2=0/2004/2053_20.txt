BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Supplementary information gas and oil unaudited A PROVED RESERVES BG Group utilises SEC definitions of proved reserves and proved developed reserves in preparing estimates of its gas and oil reserves.
Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of gas and oil which geological and engineering data demonstrate, with reasonable certainty, to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions.
Proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods.
Proved undeveloped reserves are those quantities that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where relatively major expenditure is required for completion.
Gas and oil reserves cannot be measured exactly since estimation of reserves involves subjective judgment.
Therefore, all estimates are subject to revision.
The presentation of this supplementary information has been changed in this Annual Report and Accounts, including with respect to the prior years' disclosures set out below.
These changes reflect the international growth of BG Group's proved gas and oil reserves and the greater range of markets into which they are sold.
BG Group's strategy aims to connect competitively priced gas to high value markets.
Hydrocarbon reserves, and gas in particular, are developed in relation to the markets which they are intended to supply.
Based on the above, the information below is disclosed on the basis of the following geographic areas: i the United Kingdom, ii Atlantic Basin, iii Asia and the Middle East, and iv the Rest of the World.
The countries in the Atlantic Basin and Asia and the Middle East geographic areas are grouped to reflect the nature of markets for BG Group's proved gas and oil reserves in those countries.
The allocation of the countries within these areas is: Atlantic Basin Canada, Egypt, Trinidad and USA Asia and the Middle East India, Kazakhstan, Thailand, Israel and the Areas of Palestinian Authority Rest of the World Bolivia, Brazil, Italy, Mauritania, Norway, Spain, Tunisia and Venezuela ESTIMATED NET PROVED RESERVES OF NATURAL GAS Atlantic Asia and Rest of UK Basin Middle East world Total bcf bcf bcf bcf bcf As at 31 December 2001 1 477 2 719 851 964 6 011 Movement during the year: Revisions of previous estimates 142 209 695 223 851 120 Extensions, discoveries and reclassifications 97 1 578 70 1 745 Production 282 63 126 91 562 Purchase of reserves-in-place 51 415 466 Sale of reserves-in-place 126 126 118 1 306 984 202 2 374 As at 31 December 2002 1 359 4 025 1 835 1 166 8 385 Movement during the year: Revisions of previous estimates 50 317 579 99 1 045 Extensions, discoveries and reclassifications 116 116 Production 299 175 128 76 678 Purchase of reserves-in-place 7 7 Sale of reserves-in-place 117 117 243 142 451 23 373 As at 31 December 2003 1 116 4 167 2 286 1 189 8 758 Movement during the year: Revisions of previous estimates 184 162 249 75 670 Extensions, discoveries and reclassifications 8 8 Production 269 216 149 85 719 Purchase of reserves-in-place 359 359 Sale of reserves-in-place 77 305 100 10 318 As at 31 December 2004 1 039 4 472 2 386 1 179 9 076 Proved developed reserves of natural gas: As at 31 December 2001 1 244 635 417 615 2 911 As at 31 December 2002 1 194 834 545 720 3 293 As at 31 December 2003 949 1 484 1 732 789 4 954 As at 31 December 2004 867 1 393 2 038 665 4 963 Note: Conversion factor of 6 bcf of gas to 1 mmboe.

Future cash inflows have been computed by reference to the Groups estimate of third-party prices ruling at the year end and estimates of future production of net proved gas and oil reserves at the end of each year.
The standardised measure of discounted future net cash flow information presented below is not intended to represent the replacement cost or fair market value of the Groups gas and oil properties.
The disclosures shown are based on estimates of proved reserves, future production schedules and costs which are inherently imprecise and subject to revision.
