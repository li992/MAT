Capital management policies Capital is actively managed to ensure that the Group is properly capitalised and funded at all times, having regard to its regulatory needs, prudent management and the needs of all stakeholders.
The Group has a business planning process that runs on an annual cycle with regular updates to projections.
It is through this process, which includes risk and sensitivity analyses of forecasts, and the operations of the Group Capital Management Committee GCMC that the operating businesses gain approval from the Old Mutual plc Board for their requests for capital.
The GCMC is a sub-committee of the Executive Committee of the Board, established to set an appropriate framework and guidelines to ensure the appropriate management of capital, allocation of capital to the various businesses, and monitoring of the return on allocated capital for each business relative to the agreed hurdle.
The GCMC comprises the Executive Directors of Old Mutual plc together with certain executives drawn from Old Mutual plc and or one or more subsidiaries.
Meetings are held as regularly as circumstances require and in any event not less than half-yearly and approve requests for capital that are outside the business plans.
Specifically, the Group has adopted the following capital management policies: Each regulated business is required to hold, as a minimum, capital sufficient to meet the requirements of any applicable regulator in respect of its business in the jurisdictions in which it operates and such additional capital as management believes is necessary to ensure that obligations to policyholders and or clients can be met on a timely basis.
Each business ensures that it maintains an appropriate level of liquidity at all times.
Old Mutual plc further ensures that it can meet its expected capital and financing needs at all times, having regard to the Groups business plans, forecasts and any strategic initiatives.
The Group will always ensure it maintains adequate capital resources to ensure it satisfies its regulatory requirements.
From 1 January 2005, the Group is subject to the UK Financial Services Authoritys Group capital adequacy requirements established following introduction of the EU Financial Groups Directive.
Management regularly monitors the capital requirements of the Group, taking account of future balance sheet growth, profitability, projected dividend payments and any anticipated regulatory changes, in order to ensure that the Group is at all times able to meet the forecast future minimum capital requirements.
Sensitivities The Group has both qualitative and quantitative risk management procedures to monitor, at the individual company and Group levels, the key risks and sensitivities of the business.
This is achieved through stress tests, scenario analyses and individual risk assessments by the operating businesses.
From an understanding of the principal risks, the Group defines appropriate risk limits and controls.
The key risks affecting the surplus capital of the Group are: Market Risk the risk of loss due to fluctuations in the financial markets equity investment returns, interest rates or exchange rates.
Credit Risk the risk of a major counterparty no longer being able to pay its debt, including amounts due as a result of investment activities.
Underwriting Risks arise from higher claims being experienced than anticipated when premium, bonus rates and surrender value levels were set.
Business Risks arise from changes in structural, regulatory and or competitive environments.
For further details of the management of specific risks, refer to the Corporate Governance and Directors Report on pages 26 to 41.
