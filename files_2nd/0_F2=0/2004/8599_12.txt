The 1973 valuation, covering substantially the whole of the Groups properties at that time, was made on the basis of open market values by Healey & Baker and G. L. Hearn and Partners.
The 1992 valuation, covering a number of non-retail properties, was made on the basis of open market values by J. Trevor & Sons.
The Directors believe that the aggregate open market value of Group properties exceeds the net book value of 6 billion by a considerable margin.

Sainsburys Supermarkets has an executory contract with Swan for the provision of IT services which Swan subcontracts to Accenture.
Swans principal business was the purchase and ownership of the IT assets required under the contract with Sainsburys Supermarkets and, accordingly, the transaction has been treated as, in substance, the purchase of IT fixed assets, for which the total consideration of 554 million was the fair value of the cash consideration paid and the net liabilities assumed.
The net assets purchased of 554 million consist of tangible fixed assets of 554 million, cash balances of 53 million and current liabilities of 53 million.
The net cash paid in respect of the assets purchased from Swan was 187 million, which comprised 10 million for the acquisition of the share capital, 230 million to discharge Swans external borrowings, less cash balances of 53 million acquired with Swan.
The remaining consideration of 314 million was satisfied by the assumption of the loan notes held in Swan, which is a non-cash movement for the purposes of the Group cash flow statement.
The cash flows of Swan have had no material impact in the period since 19 February 2004.
As part of the transaction, on 19 February 2004, the Swan noteholders exchanged their notes for 314.5 million 5.25% Notes due May 2007, issued by the Company.

The Company has no finance leases 2003: nil.
The Group holds a portfolio of 11 committed revolving credit facilities totalling 635 million as at 27 March 2004 2003: 635 million.
The facilities all expire within one year, although facilities of 460 million 2003: 460 million contain term out options under which the Company has the option to draw funds for terms up to 12 months prior to the maturity date.
As at 27 March 2004 there were no drawings under these facilities 2003: nil.
As described in note 14, the Group acquired the entire share capital and assets of Swan Infrastructure Holdings Limited Swan for 554 million, being the fair value of the purchase consideration which comprised 10 million in cash, 230 million to discharge Swans external borrowings and 314 million assumption of the loan notes held in Swan, issued by a member of the Swan group, Store Finance plc.
On 19 February 2004, the Group exchanged the loan notes issued by Store Finance plc, for similar term loan notes issued by J Sainsbury plc.
These new loan notes are included in the summary of borrowings in the table above.
24 Financial instruments Within the financial assets and financial liabilities analysed below, fixed rate financial assets of 7 million 2003: 7 million, financial assets on which no interest is paid of 2 million 2003: 3 million, financial liabilities on which no interest is paid of 25 million 2003: 35 million, and floating rate financial liabilities of 43 million 2003: 40 million are not included in net debt, as analysed in note 25.
Debtors receivable and creditors payable in less than one year and the current assets and current liabilities of Sainsburys Bank, are excluded from the analysis.
The Groups policies and procedures in relation to treasury management, including the management of interest and currency risk, are set out in the Operating and financial review on pages 2 to 7.

The above analysis includes store finance leases held in the Groups US operations with a capitalised value of 212 million 2003: 172 million.
It is not considered practicable to estimate the fair value of these financial liabilities as no appropriate external benchmark is available.
They are therefore included in the above analysis at book value.
38 J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Financial assets After taking into account various interest rate and currency swaps the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets was: Financial Floating Fixed assets on rate rate which no financial financial interest Total assets assets is paid m m m m Sterling 1,123 1,116 7 US Dollar 58 56 2 At 27 March 2004 1,181 1,172 7 2 Sterling 1,360 1,353 7 US Dollar 123 120 3 Other 99 At 29 March 2003 1,492 1,482 7 3 Floating rate financial assets comprise bank balances linked to bank base rates and money market fund balances, money market deposits, commercial paper investments and currency swaps bearing interest rates linked to LIBOR.
The fixed rate financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of 7.75 per cent 2003: 7.75 per cent fixed for an average period of 1.2 years 2003: 2.2 years.
The financial assets on which no interest is paid have a weighted average period until maturity of 1 year 2003: 5 years.

The financial liabilities on which no interest is paid do not have predetermined dates of payment and therefore a weighted average period of maturity cannot be calculated.
Onerous leases are considered to be a floating rate financial liability as, in establishing the provision, the cash flows have been discounted.
The discount rate is reappraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
The above analysis excludes a cancellable swap in a notional principal amount of 150 million under which the Company pays a fixed rate of 4.09 per cent and receives floating rate LIBOR.
The counterparty may exercise an option to cancel the swap on quarterly dates through to August 2030.
Currency exposures After taking into account forward contracts the Group had net euro denominated monetary assets of 25 million 2003: 42 million, US dollar denominated monetary assets of 25 million 2003: 29 million and Australian dollar monetary assets of 2 million 2003: 1 million.
Excluded from these figures are non-sterling borrowings undertaken by the Company to hedge investments in overseas operations.

The management of the Banks treasury operations is separate from that of the Group, as described in the operating and financial review on page 6.
Sainsburys Banks exposure to movements in interest rates is shown in the following table which discloses the interest rate repricing profile of assets and liabilities as at 27 March 2004.
Any asset or positive gap position reflects the fact that the Banks financial assets reprice more quickly, or in greater proportion than liabilities in a given time period and will tend to benefit net interest rate income in a rising interest rate environment.
A liability or negative gap exists when liabilities reprice more quickly or in greater proportion than assets during a given period and tends to benefit net interest income in a declining rate environment.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next contractual interest rate repricing date and the maturity date.

Under the arrangement, the Company has provided a residual value guarantee that the properties will realise at least 170 million at the end of the lease period.
In view of the relatively low amount of this guarantee when compared to the present market value of the freehold interests, the likelihood of this guarantee being invoked is regarded by the Directors as remote, therefore, no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
Operating lease commitments include payments in respect of 10 supermarket properties which were sold in July 2000 for 226 million and leased back by Sainsburys Supermarkets for a period of 23 years at a market rental, which increases by 1 per cent per annum over the lease period.
A residual value guarantee of 39 million has been given by the Company in respect of this transaction.
In view of the relatively low amount of this guarantee when compared to the present market value of the relevant freehold interests, the Directors believe that the likelihood of this guarantee being invoked is remote, therefore, no contingency is recognised in the accounts.
There are a number of contingent liabilities relating to disposals and other contractual liabilities under which it is not considered any liability will arise.
J Sainsbury plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 45 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Future capital expenditure 2004 2003 m m Contracted but not provided for 406 545 34 Pension costs The pension costs for the UK mainly relate to two funded defined benefit pension schemes, the J Sainsbury Pension and Death Benefit Scheme JSPDBS and the J Sainsbury Executive Pension Scheme JSEPS.
These schemes were closed to new employees on 31 January 2002.
The assets of these schemes are held separately from the Groups assets.
The Group Personal Pension Plan was closed on 31 January 2002.
Two new Stakeholder Pension Schemes were launched in April 2002.
The pension cost for the year ended 27 March 2004 is based on the results of a triennial valuation carried out by Watson Wyatt, the schemes independent actuaries, as at 29 March 2003, on the projected unit basis.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in the actuarial valuations are: JSPDBS JSEPS %% Long-term rate of return on investments before retirement 6.5 6.3 after retirement 6.5 6.3 Average annual increase in total pensionable salary excluding promotional increments 2.5 2.5 Average annual increase in present and future payments 2.5 2.5 Average rate of inflation 2.5 2.5 As at 29 March 2003, the market value of the assets of the UK schemes were 2,258 million 2001: 2,687 million.
The market value was sufficient to cover 93 per cent 2001: 106 per cent of the total liabilities of the schemes, a deficit of 161 million 2001: surplus 145 million.
Total pension contribution costs for the Group were 89 million for the year ended 27 March 2004 2003: 73 million of which the pension contribution costs of the UK defined benefit schemes and UK defined contribution schemes amounted to 67 million and 12 million respectively 2003: 55 million and 9 million respectively.
There is a variation from the regular cost because of scheme deficits.
These deficits are being amortised over a 14 year period using a method which increases the amount of variation from the regular cost.
Total costs for 2004 are after taking account of an amortisation of scheme deficits of 20 million 2003: amortisation of the surplus 17 million.
The Group also operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US.
