Pension and post-retirement benefit schemes The Group operates a number of pension and post-retirement healthcare schemes throughout the world.
The major schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets of the schemes are largely held in separate trustee administered funds.
The UK funds represent approximately 80% of the overall pension liabilities of the Group and are closed to new members.
The Group operates defined benefit pension and post-retirement medical benefit plans in several countries overseas, with the most significant being in the US and Canada.
In addition there are a small number of defined contribution schemes.
The assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes are reviewed regularly by independent professionally qualified actuaries.
For the UK schemes a full assessment is undertaken every three years for funding purposes and the latest full actuarial valuation of the UK schemes was carried out as at 6 April 2003 using the projected unit credit method.
The latest actuarial reviews of the US and Canadian schemes were carried out as at 1 January 2004.
The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits in full from 1 September 2003.
In prior years, the Group has complied with the transitional disclosure requirements of this standard.
The Groups investment strategy for its funded pension schemes has been developed within the framework of local statutory requirements.
The Groups policy for the allocation of assets within the schemes has the objective of maintaining the right balance between controlling risk and achieving the long-term returns which will minimise the cost to the Group.
The Group aims to invest a significant proportion of the assets 50% into equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the longer term.
In addition the Group invests approximately 40% of the assets into bonds with the remainder in properties and cash.
The total cost of pension and post-retirement benefits for the Group was 51m 2003: 49m of which 32m 2003: 29m has been charged against operating profit and 19m 2003: 20m has been charged within other finance charges.

The remainder relates to the the Group restructuring programme.
It is expected that the majority of reorganisation and restructuring costs will be incurred in the financial year ending 31 August 2005, whilst the trust funds will be disbursed as the projects develop.

Deferred tax assets of 39m at 31 August 2004 2003: 42m have not been recognised due to the degree of uncertainty over the utilisation of the underlying tax losses and deductions in certain tax jurisdictions.
Deferred tax has not been provided for liabilities which might arise on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates, as such earnings are reinvested by the Group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

Allied Domecq, together with the other players in the US drinks industry, has been named in a putative class action lawsuit in the State of Ohio alleging a consistent, long-running, deceptive programme of advertising and marketing which is illegally targeted at children and under-age drinkers and claiming disgorgement of unlawful profits.
The lawsuit, which is being vigorously defended, is in the very early pre-discovery, pre-trial pleading stages: accordingly, it is too early to determine the materiality of the contingent liability arising from this lawsuit and no reserve has been established in connection therewith.
