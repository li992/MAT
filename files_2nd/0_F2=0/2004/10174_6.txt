Accounting policies The financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
The particular accounting policies adopted by the Directors are described below and have been applied consistently throughout the current and prior year.
Accounting convention The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements of Michael Page International plc consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the pro t and loss account of the Company has not been included as part of these accounts.
The Companys pro t for the financial year amounted to 12.6m 2003: 14.0m.
Turnover and income recognition Turnover, which excludes value added tax VAT, constitutes the value of services undertaken by the Group as its principal activities, which are recruitment consultancy and other ancillary services.
These consist of: Turnover from temporary placements, which represents amounts billed for the services of temporary staff including the salary cost of these staff.
This is recognised when the service has been provided: Turnover from permanent placements, which is based on a percentage of the candidates remuneration package, and is derived from both retained assignments income recognised on completion of fide ned stages of work and non-retained assignments income recognised at the date an offer is accepted by a candidate, and where a start date has been determined.
The latter includes turnover anticipated, but not invoiced, at the balance sheet date, which is correspondingly accrued on the balance sheet within Prepayments and accrued income.
A provision is made against accrued income for possible cancellations of placements prior to, or shortly after, the commencement of employment: and Turnover from amounts billed to clients for expenses incurred on their behalf principally advertisements and is recognised when the expense is incurred.
Cost of sales Cost of sales consists of the salary cost of temporary staff and costs incurred on behalf of clients, principally advertising costs.
Gross pro t revenue Gross pro t is represented by turnover less cost of sales and consists of the total of placement fees of permanent candidates, the margin earned on the placement of temporary candidates and advertising income.
It is referred to by management as revenue.
Goodwill Since 31 December 1997, goodwill arising on acquisitions representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired has been capitalised and classi ed as an asset at cost on the balance sheet and amortised over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 December 1997 has been written off against reserves and will be charged or credited in the pro t and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
Accounting policies continued Foreign exchange Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates the transactions were made.
Exchange differences on these items are dealt with in the pro t and loss account.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Accounts of overseas operations are translated using the closing rate method.
Pro ts, losses and cash ows of overseas operations are translated at the average exchange rate applicable to the period, whereas assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the rates ruling at the period end.
Unrealised gains and losses arising on these transactions are dealt with in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Tangible xed assets Tangible xed assets are stated at original cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life at the following rates: Leasehold improvements 10% per annum or period of lease if shorter Furniture, xtures and equipment 10% - 20% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Investments in own shares, including those held by the Employee Bene t Trust and treasury shares, are shown as a deduction to shareholders funds in accordance with UITF 38.
Deferred Share Schemes Where deferred awards are made to directors and senior executives under either the Incentive Share Plan or the Annual Bonus Scheme, to re ect that the awards are for services over a longer period, the value of the expected award is charged to the pro t and loss account on a straight line basis over the vesting period to which the award relates, in accordance with UITF 17 revised 2003.
Taxation The charge for taxation is provided at rates of corporation tax ruling during the accounting period.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on unremitted earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension costs The Group operates fide ned contribution pension schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The pension costs charged to the pro t and loss account represent the contributions payable by the Group to the funds during each period.
Leased assets Rentals under operating leases are charged to the pro t and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
The amounts stated above derive from the Groups single activity of recruitment consultancy.
The above analysis by discipline being the professions of candidates placed is included as additional disclosure over and above the requirements of SSAP25 Segmental Reporting.

Due to the non operational nature of the Restricted Share Scheme, the release of the provision for payroll costs is considered to be a central cost item and as such has not been allocated to geographical regions.

Exceptional items As a result of the vesting of the Restricted Share Scheme in April 2004, the Company is able to obtain deductions for corporation tax purposes in various tax jurisdictions, resulting in a non-operating exceptional credit of 9.0m to the corporation tax charge.
The exceptional items in the comparative period included in operating pro t comprise a release of the payroll tax provision on the Restricted Share Scheme of 1.9m, and rentals and other unavoidable costs on onerous lease agreements on vacant properties in the UK of 3.0m.
The net effect of these two items of 1.1m was included within administrative expenses.
An exceptional tax credit on these items of 0.3m resulted in a net post tax exceptional item of 0.8m.

Taxation on pro ts on ordinary activities continued c Factors affecting future taxation charges In the overseas jurisdictions where the Group currently operates, tax rates are generally higher than those in the UK.
Certain of the Groups overseas operations have current and prior year tax losses, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
Accordingly the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 5.3m 2003: 3.9m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
These tax losses are available to offset future taxable pro ts in the respective jurisdictions.

These options are subject to the following: a 55.6% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that Earnings Per Share EPS targets have been satis ed over a period of 3 to 10 years.
None of these options will vest unless EPS has grown in line with the UK Retail Prices Index RPI plus an average of 5% per annum.
At that point 33.3% of this portion of the options vest.
If EPS growth is higher than this level, vesting increases on a sliding scale basis until 100% of this portion of the options vest where EPS growth matches RPI plus an average of 10% per annum: The base earnings per share is 9.9p.
At 31 December 2004, the performance conditions had not been met.
b 44.4% of an individuals option entitlement will normally only be exercisable to the extent that share price growth targets have been satis ed over a period of at least 3 years.
None of these options will vest unless the Companys share price has achieved 50% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
Vesting then increases progressively for further share price growth until full vesting occurs where there is 200% growth after 3 years and not later than 5 years.
These hurdles rise from the fifth anniversary of the date of grant at compound rates of growth of 8.45% and 24.57% respectively.
Called-up share capital continued Note 2 2002 Grant On 14 March 2002, options over 7,500,000 ordinary shares were granted in two tranches to the Executive Directors and 203 employees at an exercise price of 186p.
The first tranche of options is exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant.
The second tranche is exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 4 and 10 years from the date of grant.
These options were granted subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, in normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share as fide ned of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the retail price index.
The 2001 earnings per share of 10.6p is the base for the first tranche of options.
The 2002 earnings per share of 5.8p is the base for the second tranche of options.
Note 3 2003 Grant On 8 April 2003, options over 7,140,000 were granted to the Executive Directors and 110 employees at exercise prices of between 81.5p and 86.1p.
These are exercisable, under normal circumstances, between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant.
These grants are subject to a performance condition requiring that an option may only be exercised, under normal circumstances, if there has been an increase in base earnings per share as fide ned of at least 3% per annum above the growth in the retail price index.

61 Annual General Meeting Notes continued 9.
Shareholders have already given approval for the Company to buy, hold and re-sell its own shares as treasury shares see Resolution 9 and Note 5 to this Notice.
The Directors are now seeking shareholder approval to use treasury shares to satisfy options and awards granted to participants under the Michael Page Incentive Share Scheme 2004 the ISP.
The ability to use treasury shares under the ISP is required because advice has been received that tax and legal problems may arise in certain overseas jurisdictions if existing shares are delivered to participants in the ISP by the trustees of the Michael Page Employees Bene t Trust the Trustees.
Consequently, it is anticipated that treasury shares will only be used under the ISP in those jurisdictions where tax or legal problems arise in connection with the delivery of existing shares by the Trustees.
