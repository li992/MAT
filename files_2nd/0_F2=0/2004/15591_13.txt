The standard requires that earnings should be based on the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders.
The calculation for earnings, including and excluding net loss on disposal of xed assets, integration costs and goodwill amortisation, is based on the profit for the financial year of 1,100m 2003 946m.
For the purposes of calculating earnings per share, the number of shares is the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 7,307 million 2003 6,989 million.
The calculation for diluted earnings per share uses the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance-based options which the Group considers to have been earned.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable ordinary share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period.
The alternative measure of earnings per share is provided because it reects the Groups underlying trading performance excluding the effect of the loss on disposal of xed assets, integration costs and amortisation of goodwill.

Hedges As explained in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 2 to 5, the Group hedges exposures to interest rate and currency risk.
The table below shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses, which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.

NOTE 26 Share options Company schemes The company had six principal share option schemes in operation during the year: i The savings-related share option scheme 1981 permits the grant to employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 5 and 250 per four-weekly period.
Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three and five-year period at a subscription price not less than 80% of the middle-market quotation of an ordinary share immediately prior to the date of grant.
ii The Irish savings-related share option scheme 2000 permits the grant to Irish employees of options in respect of ordinary shares linked to a building society bank save-as-you-earn contract for a term of three or five years with contributions from employees of an amount between 12 and 320 per four-weekly period.
Options are capable of being exercised at the end of the three and five-year period at a subscription price not less than 75% of the middle-market quotation of an ordinary share immediately prior to the date of grant.
iii The executive share option scheme 1984 permitted the grant of options in respect of ordinary shares to selected executives.
The scheme expired after ten years on 9 November 1994.
Options were generally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant at a subscription price determined by the Board but not less than the middle-market quotation within the period of 30 days prior to the date of grant.
Some options have been granted at a discount of 15% of the standard option price but the option holder may take advantage of that discount only if, in accordance with investor protection ABI guidelines, certain targets related to earnings per share are achieved.
46 TESCO PLC NOTE 26 Share options continued iv The executive share option scheme 1994 was adopted on 17 October 1994.
The principal difference between this scheme and the previous scheme is that the exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over any three-year period.
There will be no discounted options granted under this scheme.
v The unapproved executive share option scheme 1996 was adopted on 7 June 1996.
This scheme was introduced following legislative changes which limited the number of options which could be granted under the previous scheme.
As with the previous scheme, the exercise of options will normally be conditional upon the achievement of a specified performance target related to the annual percentage growth in earnings per share over any three-year period.
vi The international executive share option scheme 1994 was adopted on 20 May 1994.
This scheme permits the grant to selected non-UK executives of options to acquire ordinary shares on substantially the same basis as their UK counterparts.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from their grant at a price of not less than the average of the middle-market quotations for the ordinary shares for the three dealing days immediately preceding their grant and will normally be conditional on the achievement of a specified performance target determined by the Remuneration Committee when the options are granted.
Tesco PLC has taken advantage of the exemptions applicable to Inland Revenue-approved SAYE share option schemes and equivalent overseas schemes under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 revised 2000, Employee Share Schemes.
In schemes where options are granted at nil discount, there is no charge to the profit and loss account.
FRS 17, Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000, and the transitional disclosures required by that standard, to the extent they are not given in note a, are set out in note b.
For the year ending February 2006 the Group is expected to adopt International Accounting Standard 19.
The full actuarial valuation of the main UK scheme carried out as at 31 March 2002 continues to form the basis for funding the scheme.
The company has reviewed the results of the subsequent FRS 17 valuation and does not consider that any changes to the level of funding are necessary at this time.
a Pension commitments United Kingdom The principal plan within the Group is the Tesco PLC Pension Scheme, which is a funded dened benefit pension scheme in the UK, the assets of which are held as a segregated fund and administered by trustees.
The total profit and loss charge of UK schemes to the Group during the year was 152m 2003 114m.
A SSAP 24 pension prepayment of 12m 2003 6m is present in the Group balance sheet.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme at 31 March 2002.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions.
The key assumptions made were a rate of return on investments of 6.75%, a rate of increase in salaries of 4% and a rate of increase in pensions of 2.5%.
At the date of the last actuarial valuation, the market value of the schemes assets was 1,576m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 91% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The actuarial shortfall of 159m will be met via increased contributions over a period of ten years, being the expected average remaining service lifetime of employed members.
The next actuarial valuation is due at 31 March 2005.
The T&S Stores PLC Senior Executive Pension Scheme is a funded dened benefit scheme open to senior executives and certain other employees at the invitation of the company.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme at 6 April 2001.
At that time, the market value of the schemes assets was 5.8m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 110% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Overseas The Group operates a number of schemes worldwide, which include dened benefit and dened contribution schemes.
The contributions payable for non-UK schemes of 8m 2003 8m have been fully expensed against profits in the current year.
A funded dened benefit scheme operates in the Republic of Ireland.
An independent actuary, using the projected unit method, carried out the latest actuarial assessment of the scheme at 1 April 2001.
At that time the market value of the schemes assets was 55m and the actuarial value of these assets represented 123% of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
b FRS 17, Retirement Benets The valuations used for FRS 17 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations and updated by Watson Wyatt LLP to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 28 February 2004.
Schemes assets are stated at their market values at 28 February 2004.
Buck Consultants Ireland Limited have updated the most recent Republic of Ireland valuation.
The liabilities relating to post-retirement healthcare benets note 28 have also been determined in accordance with FRS 17, and are incorporated in the following tables.

The cost of providing these benets has been accounted for on a similar basis to that used for dened benefit pension schemes.
The liability as at 28 February 2004 of 6.5m, which was determined in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries, is being spread forward over the service lives of relevant employees.
0.5m has been charged to the profit and loss account and 0.4m of benets were paid.
An accrual of 5.4m 2003 5.3m is being carried in the balance sheet.

TESCO PLC 53 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED NOTE 34 Acquisitions The net assets and results of acquired businesses are included in the consolidated accounts from their respective dates of acquisition.
The following tables set out the effect of the material acquisitions by the Group in the year to 28 February 2004 on the consolidated balance sheet.
Acquisition accounting has been applied in all cases.
The fair values currently established for all acquisitions made in the year to 28 February 2004 are provisional.
Fair values will be reviewed based on additional information up to 26 February 2005.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.
C Two-Network C Two-Network was acquired on 17 July 2003 and included in the consolidated balance sheet at 28 February 2004.
The net assets of C Two-Network on acquisition and the provisional fair values were as follows: Adjustments Book values to align Fair values of acquired accounting at date of business policies Revaluations acquisition m m m m Fixed assets 13 2 3 12 Stock 88 Debtors 24 24 Cash 31 31 Creditors 30 2 32 Net assets acquired 46 3 43 Consideration Cash 176 Goodwill 133 The principal fair value adjustment made to the net book values of the assets and liabilities of C Two-Network was the revaluation of xed assets.
For the year ended 31 March 2003, C Two-Network reported an audited profit after tax and minority interest of 11m, and for the period 1 April 2003 to 16 July 2003 an unaudited post-tax profit of 5m based on its then accounting policies.

Adjustments have also been made to align accounting policies for tangible xed assets, debtors, cash, creditors and provisions.
The Turkish economy is subject to hyper-ination and therefore hyper-ination accounting under international accounting standards, is required.
The Directors do not consider that it is meaningful to provide details of the results of Kipa for the year ended 31 December 2002 as these accounts were not prepared using hyper-ination accounting.
For the period 1 January 2003 to 10 November 2003, Kipa reported an unaudited provisional profit after tax of nil, based on its then accounting policies.
