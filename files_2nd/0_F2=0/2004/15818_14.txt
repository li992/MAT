PENSIONS The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24 and the disclosures given in a comply with that standard.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group has elected to defer full implementation of the standard until the year ended 31 December 2005.
Nevertheless, a number of items determined in accordance with FRS 17 must be disclosed.
These disclosures, to the extent not given under a, are set out in b for funded defined benefit schemes and in c for unfunded defined benefit schemes.
The disclosures in respect of post retirement benefits other than pensions are set out in note 20. a SSAP 24 Disclosures As at 1 January 2005, the Group operates pension plans throughout the world, covering the majority of its employees.
These plans are structured to accord with local conditions and practices in each country and include defined contribution and defined benefit plans.
In the case of the defined benefit plans, amounts are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of providing benefits over employees service lives.
Further details on the schemes in the two principal countries the United Kingdom and the United States are set out below.
At 1 January 2005, pension related assets of 28.2 million 3 January 2004 25.3 million Company 2.3 million 3 January 2004 3.1 million and pension related liabilities of 55.3 million 3 January 2004 53.4 million Company 6.3 million 3 January 2004 6.7 million were included in debtors and creditors respectively.
United Kingdom The majority of plans in the United Kingdom are defined benefit in nature and provide benefits based on final pensionable salary and length of service.
The assets of the plans are held by trustees in separate pension funds and day to day management of those assets is carried out by independent professional investment managers who, at the request of the Company, are prohibited by the trustees from investing directly in Tomkins.
All plan assets are held by custodians who are independent of the investment managers and of Tomkins.
The latest actuarial valuations and formal reviews of the plans were carried out by independent consulting actuaries, with effective dates between December 2002 and December 2004 using the projected unit method of valuation, which includes allowance for future earnings growth.
Assets were valued at market value.
The principal assumptions used in valuing the scheme liabilities are set out in the tables on page 45.
At the dates of the latest formal actuarial valuations, the market value of the assets of the plans amounted to 180.6 million which was sufficient to cover 96 per cent 3 January 2004 90 per cent of the liabilities for benefits accrued to members.
At 1 January 2005, total plan assets had a market value of 187.1 million 3 January 2004 186.0 million.
Certain employees whose benefits exceed the maximum that can be paid from the approved arrangements are entitled to an additional pension payable directly from the Company following retirement.
An accrued liability of nil 3 January 2004 2.7 million is included in the balance sheet in respect of this.
There are a small number of defined contribution plans where contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they fall due.
United States of America Both defined benefit and defined contribution plans are operated in the United States of America.
Assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Defined benefit plans are operated by a number of the Groups US subsidiaries providing benefits based upon pensionable salary and length of service.
Actuarial valuations of the assets and liabilities are performed annually by independent consulting actuaries, using the projected unit method of valuation which includes allowance for future earnings growth.
At the date of the latest formal actuarial valuations, total plan assets had a market value of 208.1 million 3 January 2004 212.8 million.
The actuarial valuation of the assets was sufficient to cover 79 per cent 3 January 2004 84 per cent of the estimated accrued liabilities of the funded plans.
At 1 January 2005, total plan assets had a market value of 217.5 million 3 January 2004 223.0 million.
Defined contribution plans, which include profit sharing plans, cover most of Tomkins US employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they fall due.
Other countries Over 60 per cent of Tomkins employees are either in the UK or in the US.
For the balance, Tomkins operates both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Where these are not available, state benefits are considered adequate.
Full provision is made for liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes in these countries, as calculated in accordance with actuarial advice and contributions to defined contribution plans are accounted for in the year in which they fall due.

PENSIONS CONTINUED During the year ended 1 January 2005, the total amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of all the Groups defined benefit and defined contribution plans was 45.9 million 3 January 2004 47.9 million, as analysed below.

Directors Report and Accounts 2004 45 Notes to the accounts continued 26.
The projected unit method of valuation has been used to calculate the charge to operating profit and in the case of the closed plans, the service cost as a percentage of payroll will increase over time as members approach retirement.

CONTINGENCIES The Company guarantees the bank facilities of certain subsidiaries and the Group provides cash as security for letters of credit in order to reduce their cost.
The maximum amount covered by these arrangements at 1 January 2005 was 179.5 million 3 January 2004 156.2 million and 4.9 million 3 January 2004 3.8 million respectively.
The Company has also guaranteed certain property leases and performance bonds entered into in the ordinary course of business by certain of its subsidiaries.
The Group is also, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of any of the above proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Group's financial position.

Net debt funds comprise cash and deposits, borrowings and off balance sheet contracts.
The borrowings and off balance sheet contracts shown against each currency are matched against the assets and liabilities of that currency under the requirements of SSAP 20 and to that extent produce no net gain or loss on translation into sterling for the purposes of the Group profit and loss account.
Net currency gains of 12.1 million 3 January 2004 35.0 million relating to foreign currency derivatives used to ensure that the Groups net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the Groups net assets are denominated have been included in the foreign exchange translation movement in the profit and loss account.

Long-term borrowings consist mainly of the 250 million and 150 million Medium Term Notes, the fair values of which have been determined by reference to market rates.
Deposits are held short-term and mainly attract floating rates.
Foreign currency derivatives are used to ensure that the Groups net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the Groups assets are denominated.
These are marked to market and the resulting differences recognised, thereby avoiding significant divergence between book and fair values.
Where foreign currency cash flows generated by overseas investments have not been remitted to Tomkins plc at the time of dividend payment, forward contracts are used to ensure the currency profile of the Group is in line with policy.
Fair value of preference shares The above analysis excludes the details of the fair value of the preference shares.
These preference shares are not traded on an organised market and fair values are therefore not readily available.
Other details of the preference shares are given in note 22.
