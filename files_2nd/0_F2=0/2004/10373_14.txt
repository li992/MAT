Pensions Retirement and death benets are provided for eligible employees in the United Kingdom principally by the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan MABPP and the Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan MABEPP.
The dened benefit sections of the plans closed to new entrants during 2002 with new members provided with defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Companys assets.
On 1 April 2003, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited became the sponsoring employer for the former Six Continents Pension Plan and Six Continents Executive Pension Plan, after the transfer of obligations and related assets to newly created InterContinental Hotels Group pension schemes.
The Six Continents Pension Plan and Six Continents Executive Pension Plan were subsequently renamed the Mitchells & Butlers Pension Plan and Mitchells & Butlers Executive Pension Plan respectively.
Under the principles of merger accounting, the Mitchells & Butlers element of the Six Continents PLC pension plans is reected in these financial statements for the periods prior to 1 April 2003.
On 6 November 2003, Mitchells & Butlers plc became the sponsoring employer of the pension plans resulting in the recognition of the Groups SSAP 24 prepayment and related reserve see note 26 in the Company.
In the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2004, the Group made regular contributions to the pension plans of 4m and additional contributions of 40m.
In 2003, the regular contributions were 10m, including 5m prepaid for the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2004, and additional contributions of 27m were paid.
Proposed employer contribution rates to the dened benefit arrangements for 2004 05 are 16.5% for the MABPP and 34.0% for the MABEPP.
It has also been agreed that further additional contributions of 40m will be paid over the next three years, in addition to the remaining 20m under the agreement reached at the time of the securitisation.
10m was paid on 15 October 2004 with a further payment of 20m planned for later in 2004 05.
Mitchells & Butlers 33 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued 7.
Pensions continued The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 and provide the transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 in the notes to the financial statements.
With effect from 26 September 2004, the Group intends to adopt FRS 17 in full.
SSAP 24 The profit and loss account charge is analysed as follows: 2004 2003 m m Regular cost 11 12 Variations from regular cost 3 3 Notional interest on prepayment 6 4 Cost of dened benefit arrangements 2 5 Cost of dened contribution arrangements 1 3 5 Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries using the projected unit method.
They reect the 31 March 2002 actuarial valuations of the Six Continents PLC pension plans.
The significant assumptions in these valuations were that wages and salaries increase on average by 4% per annum, the long-term return on assets is 6.3% per annum, and pensions increase by 2.5% per annum.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is 13 years.
At 31 March 2002, the market value of the combined assets of the Six Continents PLC pension plans was 1,187m and the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 100% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
Actuarial valuations as at 31 March 2004 are in the process of being nalised.
Initial results reveal that experience has been adverse since 2002 and that the pension plans were in deficit by 167m at 31 March 2004.
FRS 17 disclosures The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures are based on the initial results of the full actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2004 updated by independent qualied actuaries to 25 September 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 25 September 2004 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the dened benefit sections of the pension plans are now closed to new members, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.
The principal assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the liabilities at the balance sheet date on an FRS 17 basis were: 2004 2003 2002 Wages and salaries increases 4.3% 4.2% 3.8% Pensions increases 2.8% 2.7% 2.3% Discount rate 5.5% 5.3% 5.5% Ination rate 2.8% 2.7% 2.3% The combined assets of the MABPP and MABEPP and the expected rates of return at the balance sheet date were: 2004 2003 2002 Long-term Long-term Long-term rates rates rates of return of return of return expected Value expected Value expected Value %m % m %m Equities 8.0 460 8.0 396 8.0 364 Bonds 4.9 373 4.9 355 4.7 285 Property 8.0 82 8.0 74 8.0 66 Total market value of assets 915 825 715 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,088 1,068 913 deficit in the schemes 173 243 198 Related deferred tax asset 59 73 59 Net pension liability 114 170 139 Mitchells & Butlers 34 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 7.

In connection with the special dividend, a share consolidation was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on 1 December 2003 and then implemented on 2 December 2003.
The 1 share consolidation resulted in the issue of 12 new ordinary shares of 7 12p each for every 17 existing ordinary shares of 5p each.
The proposed final dividend, if approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM, will be paid on 31 January 2005 to shareholders registered on 10 December 2004.
Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings available for shareholders of 125m 2003 125m by 559m 2003 735m, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares, excluding own shares, in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share have been calculated by adjusting basic earnings per share to reect the notional exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share options outstanding under the Groups share option schemes.
The resulting weighted average number of ordinary shares is 563m 2003 736m.
In arriving at the weighted average number of shares for the comparative period, it has been assumed that the ordinary shares of Mitchells & Butlers plc in issue on 15 April 2003 following separation from Six Continents of 734m was the number of shares in issue prior to separation.
As explained in note 11, in December 2003 the Company combined the payment of a special dividend of 68p per 5p ordinary share with a consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were designed to have the same overall commercial effect, in terms of net assets, earnings and number of shares, as a buy back of shares at fair value.
Accordingly, earnings per share for prior periods have not been restated.
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share are calculated as follows: 2004 2003 pence pence per ordinary per ordinary notes share share Basic earnings 22.4 17.0 Exceptional items, less tax thereon 8, 10 0.2 3.3 Adjusted earnings 22.2 20.3 Adjusted earnings per share are disclosed in order to show performance for the 52 weeks ended 25 September 2004 undistorted by exceptional items and thereby give shareholders a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group.
However, due to the significant changes made to the nancing structure of the Group on separation from Six Continents on 15 April 2003, adjusted earnings per share above does not give a true indication of the underlying performance of the Group in the comparative period.
Pro forma earnings per share, which adjusts for the changes in financing structure in the comparative period, is therefore presented on page 24 of the Annual Report and Financial Statements.

The transitional rules of FRS 15 have been followed, permitting the carrying value of properties as at 1 October 1999 to be retained.
In 1996, a group restructuring by Six Continents resulted in the transfer at book value of certain xed assets to a subsidiary that subsequently became part of the Mitchells & Butlers group.
The book value included the effect of revaluations undertaken prior to 1996.
Accordingly, the carrying value of the Groups fixed assets reflects those revaluations in its historic cost, which at 25 September 2004 amounted to 392m 2003 400m.
In addition, the carrying value of the Groups fixed assets reflects the 1999 revaluation see below which at 25 September 2004 amounted to 339m 2003 341m.
The most recent valuation of properties reected in the carrying value of xed assets was undertaken in 1999 and covered all properties then owned by the Group other than leasehold properties having an unexpired term of 50 years or less.
This valuation was undertaken by external chartered surveyors, Chesterton plc, internationally recognised valuers, in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
The basis of valuation was predominantly existing use value and had regard to trading potential.

Borrowings continued Securitised debt On 13 November 2003, a group company, Mitchells & Butlers Finance plc, issued 1,900m of secured loan notes in connection with the securitisation of the majority of the Groups UK pubs and restaurants business owned by Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited.
The funds raised were mainly used to repay existing bank borrowings of 1,243m, pay issue costs of 23m and return 501m to shareholders by way of a special dividend see note 11.
The loan notes consist of six tranches with principal terms as follows: Tranche m Interest Principal repayment period Expected WAL A1 200 Floating By instalments 2011 to 2028 6 years A2 550 5.574% By instalments 2003 to 2028 12 years A3 250 Floating By instalments 2011 to 2028 6 years B1 350 5.965% By instalments 2003 to 2023 10 years B2 350 6.013% By instalments 2015 to 2028 20 years C 200 6.469% By instalments 2029 to 2030 25 years 1,900 The expected remaining WAL weighted average life is based on the amortisation prole of the individual note tranches and assumes renancing of the A1 and A3 notes on the margin step-up dates below.
The notes are secured on substantially all of the Groups property and future income streams therefrom.
Interest on the Class A1 notes is payable at three month LIBOR plus a margin of 0.45%, stepping up to LIBOR plus 0.90% in December 2010.
These notes are fully hedged using interest rate swaps which x the interest rate payable.
The Class A3 notes were issued in principal amount of $418.75m, with interest payable at three month US dollar LIBOR plus a margin of 0.45%, stepping up to US dollar LIBOR plus 0.90% in December 2010.
These notes are fully hedged using currency swaps and interest rate swaps, whereby all principal and interest liabilities are swapped into sterling providing an initial principal of 250m and xed interest payable.
The overall cash interest rate payable on the loan notes is 6% after taking account of interest rate hedging and the cost of the provision of a financial guarantee provided by Ambac in respect of the Class A notes.
The securitisation is governed by various covenants, warranties and events of default, many of which apply to Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited, the Groups main operating subsidiary.
These include covenants regarding the maintenance and disposal of securitised properties and restrictions on its ability to move cash, by way of dividends for example, to other group companies.
At 25 September 2004, Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited had short-term deposits and cash of 98m, which were governed by certain restrictions under the covenants associated with the securitisation.
The carrying value of the loan notes in the Group balance sheet at 25 September 2004 is analysed as follows: m Gross proceeds received on 13 November 2003 1,900 Principal repaid 28 Principal outstanding at 25 September 2004 1,872 Deferred issue costs 22 Accrued interest 3 Carrying value at 25 September 2004 1,853 Mitchells & Butlers 43 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued 20.

Financial instruments The Groups treasury policy and use of financial instruments are discussed in the Operating and Financial Review on page 5.
The disclosures in this note exclude short-term debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS 13.
Principal hedging instruments In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group has entered into interest rate and currency swap agreements that x the interest payable on the oating rate tranches of the securitised debt see note 20.
At 25 September 2004, these agreements were for a notional principal amount of 450m 2003 nil.

Financial instruments continued Currency risk After taking into account the above hedging arrangements, the Group does not have a material profit and loss account exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities.
In addition, the Group is predominantly UK based and therefore does not have a significant currency exposure from its operations.
Under the provisions of SSAP 20, any foreign exchange gains or losses arising from the translation of overseas net assets are recognised in the statement of total recognised group gains and losses.

The fair value of interest rate and currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group could expect to pay or receive on the termination of the agreements.
These amounts are based on quotations from counterparties and take into consideration interest and exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Borrowings under the syndicated loan facility incurred interest at oating rates and their book value therefore approximated to their fair value.
Other financial assets and liabilities are either short-term in nature or book values approximate to fair values.
Gains and losses on hedges Gains and losses on derivative instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on hedging instruments are as follows: Gains Losses Net m m m Unrecognised at 28 September 2003 Arising in the year but not recognised 10 10 Unrecognised at 25 September 2004 10 10 Analysed as: Expected to be recognised in 2004 05 1 1 Expected to be recognised thereafter 9 9 10 10 Mitchells & Butlers 45 Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued 22.
