Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 54 Notes to the Accounts For the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting Policies a Accounting convention Cairn prepares its accounts under the historical cost convention.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Cairns accounts fall within the scope of the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP issued by the Oil Industry Accounting Committee, Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and Decommissioning Activities and have been prepared in accordance with the provisions thereof.
c Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 December.
The consolidated profit and loss account and cash flow statement include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year, using the acquisition method of accounting.
The consolidated profit and loss account and cash flow statement include the results and cash flows of subsidiary undertakings disposed of during the year, up to the date of disposal.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
In accordance with FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, subject to review for impairment in periods where events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves at 31 December 1997 has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
The goodwill that was not reinstated will be charged to the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
No Company profit and loss account is presented, as provided by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. d Turnover Turnover represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production and tariff income, recognised on a direct entitlement basis.
e Fixed assets Cairn follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas assets.
Under this method, all expenditure incurred in connection with and directly attributable to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas assets, including interest payable and exchange differences incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects, is capitalised in two geographical cost pools: South Asia and North Sea.
On disposing of the Groups last remaining North Sea interest during the year only one cost pool remains at the year end.
The capitalisation of expenditure under each phase of the project ends on completion of that phase.
Acquisition, exploration and appraisal expenditure is capitalised as exploration assets within the balance sheet.
Exploration assets expenditure is transferred to development producing assets when the commercial reserves attributable to the underlying asset have been established.
Further expenditure on fixed assets in the production phase is capitalised where future economic benefit is enhanced.
Net proceeds from any disposal of oil and gas assets are credited against the previously capitalised costs.
In the case of disposal of an asset holding subsidiary, net proceeds represents the net book value of the assets sold together with the gain or loss arising on disposal of that subsidiary.
f Depletion, impairment and depreciation Depletion Cairn depletes expenditure on oil and gas production and development on a unit of production basis, based on proved and probable reserves.
Impairment Exploration assets are reviewed regularly for indications of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances if the exploration asset has a corresponding development producing cost pool, then the exploration costs are transferred to that cost pool and are written off on a unit of production basis through the depletion charge.
Where there is no such development producing cost pool, the exploration costs are charged immediately to the profit and loss account.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 55 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 Impairment reviews on development producing oil and gas assets are carried out from a geographical pool perspective, in accordance with FRS 11.
Each year, the net book value of the pool is compared with the associated discounted future net cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the profit and loss account as impairment.
Discounted future net cash flows for FRS 11 purposes are calculated using an estimated oil price of $20 bbl 2003: $15 bbl, escalation prices and costs of 3% and a discount rate of 10%.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier year, that charge can be reversed in a later period to the extent that the discounted cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
Depreciation Fixed assets, other than oil and gas assets, are depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Depreciation Method Tenants improvements 10 - 33 straight line Vehicles, fixtures and equipment 25 - 50 straight line g Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation to rectify environmental damage arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within fixed assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is shown as the decommissioning charge in the profit and loss account, and the unwinding of discount is included within other finance costs - unwinding of discount in note 8. h Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of all overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches in US$, with the exception of certain Dutch companies which are recorded in Euros.
Cairn translates overseas subsidiary accounts using the closing rate method, whereby assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date and profit and loss items are translated into sterling at average rates for the year.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets and associated long term borrowings of overseas subsidiary undertakings and branches directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to 1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December 2004 2004 2003 US$ 1.920 1.832 1.790 EUR 1.413 1.473 1.419 Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 56 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting Policies continued i Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less or to receive more tax, with the following exceptions: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, and gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
j Pension schemes Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
The pension cost charge represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
As required under Indian legislation, the Group also operates a defined benefit scheme for certain Indian employees.
Contributions are assessed annually for any surplus deficit in funding based on the annual actuarial valuation.
The scheme is funded to the required level at least annually.
On the grounds of materiality, contributions have been charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pension charges are detailed in note 5. k Leasing commitments Cairn charges rental payable under operating leases to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
l Share schemes The costs of awards to employees, in the form of shares or the rights to shares, under the long term incentive plan LTIP are recognised over the period to which the employees performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares at the date of the award and on a reasonable expectation of the extent to which the performance criteria will be met.
m Change in Accounting Policies UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts became effective for accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2004.
Amendments to UITF 17 following the introduction of UITF 38 requires the recognition of the charge in the profit and loss account for shares held in trust to satisfy awards made under the LTIP to be on the basis of the fair value of the awards at the time they were made.
Previously, UK Accounting Standards required the release to be made on the basis of the cost of any shares purchased by the ESOP Trust.
In addition, following the implementation of UITF 38, shares in the ESOP Trust have been reclassified from Investments to Shares held by ESOP Trust within shareholders funds.
The effect of reclassifying the shares from investment in own shares to shareholders funds is to reduce the Groups net assets by 4.3m at 31 December 2003.
A prior year adjustment to the profit and loss account of 83,000 2003: 74,000: 2002: 9,000 has arisen from this change in accounting policy and prior year comparatives have been restated to reflect the changes required pursuant to UITF 38.
As a result of the change to accounting treatment, the profit for the period under review is 2.3m greater than had there been no revision to policies.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 57 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 2 Acquisition of Bangladesh assets The transaction to acquire Shells upstream interests in Bangladesh, including a further 37.5% interest in the producing Sangu gas field, completed on 30 June 2004.
From an accounting perspective, revenue and expenditure associated with the Sangu interest acquired has been recognised in the profit and loss account from this date.
Cairns entitlement to operating profits between the economic effective date of the transaction 1 July 2003 and the date of completion have not been recognised in the profit and loss account but have instead been adjusted against the US$50m capitalised consideration.
Also adjusted against consideration is the US$0.24 mscf payment due to Shell on entitlement production from the acquired interest due for the interim period.
The 23.8m $42.5m paid on completion includes the acquisition of circa 7.2m $12.5m of net working capital recoverable at 30 June 2004.
Reserves associated with the acquisition were also booked on the completion date.

Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 62 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 9 Taxation continued b Factors affecting tax charge for year The tax charged for the year is higher than the weighted average rate for the year.
The difference is explained below: 2003 Notes 2004 Restated 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 15,897 69,013 Tax at weighted average rate of corporation tax of 10.04% 2003: 20.59% 1,596 14,210 Effects of: Permanent differences including tax holiday 2,571 1,359 Capital allowances for period in excess of depreciation 27,746 13,477 Other timing differences 9,382 1,981 Unrealised losses arising in the year not relievable against current tax 2,962 5,092 Creation of current year losses 9 c 21,114 3,724 Utilisation of losses 127 2,208 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2,104 Payment of Minimum Alternate Tax 9 c 260 1,582 Total current tax charge 2,246 5,583 c Factors that may affect future corporate tax charges At 31 December 2004, Cairn had losses of approximately 57.6m 2003: 11.3m available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to UK Corporation Tax and surplus management expenses of 11.3m 2003: 1.1m available for offset against future investment income chargeable to UK Corporation Tax.
At 31 December 2004, Cairn had losses of approximately 4.5m 2003: 9.1m available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to Netherlands Corporate Income Tax but there are restrictions on the use of these losses.
At 31 December 2004, Cairn had losses of approximately 12.6m 2003: nil available for offset against future trading profits chargeable to Indian Corporate Income Tax.
Tax losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot usually be offset against profits arising in another jurisdiction.
Where losses arising in the year are not relievable against current tax, deferred tax assets have not been recognised.
Cairn operates in countries where the tax rate is different to the UK corporation tax rate, e. g. India 41.82%.
In India, Minimum Alternate Tax MAT is payable instead of Corporate Income Tax CIT where MAT on accounting profits results in a higher tax liability than CIT on taxable profits.
In India, tax is calculated on a fiscal year basis so where MAT is due for one fiscal year and CIT for the next, the consolidated accounts will show both CIT and MAT in the same calendar year.
Cairn has several group companies with Indian tax liabilities.
Cairn operates in countries where relief from tax on profits is available for a set period of time, known as a tax holiday.
In India, there is a tax holiday of seven years on profits from certain assets but the relief is restricted if, in the same company, there are losses from other assets in the same year.
Based on current expenditure plans, the Group anticipates that tax allowances will continue to exceed the accounting depletion charge each year.
However the timing of related tax relief is uncertain.

19 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing financial risks.
Cairns strategy is to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Equity finance, project finance and other alternatives are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas development projects.
Cairns principal financial instruments comprise investments, cash and short term deposits.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance Cairns operations.
Cairn has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 13 for short term debtors and creditors.
They have, therefore, with the exception of the foreign currency risk disclosure, been excluded from the numerical disclosures.
Cairns treasury function is responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash flow monitoring.
It must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that Cairn has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its cash requirements.
Cairn may from time to time, with the approval of the Board, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and movements in oil and gas prices.
It is however, and has been throughout the period under review, Cairns policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Cairn Energy PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 70 Notes to the Accounts continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 19 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments continued The main risks arising from Cairns financial instruments are foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and liquidity risk.
The current policy for managing these risks is detailed below: Liquidity interest rate risk Cairn entered into new debt financing arrangements on 20 January 2004.
As a result the Group has $240m $40m seven year and $200m three year unsecured committed multicurrency revolving credit facilities available under corporate bilateral agreements to fund its activities.
Revolving credit facilities give the Group flexibility to borrow and repay debt as and when appropriate.
When the Group has surplus cash it is placed on short term deposit, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its expenditure requirements.
Short medium term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates although there is no debt drawn at 31 December 2004.
Short term deposits are currently at floating money market interest rates.
Board approval is required for all new borrowing facilities over 5m.
Short term deposits held at 31 December 2004 64.1m are included within the floating rate financial assets 2003: 12.1m.
Commodity price risk There are natural product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Ravva gas GSCs, Sangu gas under the Sangu GSPA and Lakshmi gas under the Lakshmi GSCs.
The requirement for hedging instruments is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
No hedging contracts have been entered into during the year.
No outstanding hedging was in place at the start of the year or at the year end.
Foreign currency risk Although the Group reports in sterling, a large proportion of its business is conducted in US$ with the majority of Cairn revenues being received in US$ and a significant proportion of expenditure being incurred in US$.
Cairn manages this, and other exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency and actively managing the residual net position.
Although the Groups commercial currency risk exposure is minimised through currency matching, movements in US$ against sterling can have an impact from a reporting perspective due to the underlying assets of the Group being US$ denominated.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The $240m facilities are multicurrency committed facilities, which allow drawdowns in US$, sterling or any other currency that is freely convertible and transferable into US$.
At 31 December 2004 there was no debt drawn.
Exchange rates are monitored in conjunction with forecast currency requirements.
Currency exposures are shown in the table on page 73.
No forward foreign exchange contracts were entered into during the year.
There were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.

30 Contingent Liabilities a Ravva Arbitration The calculation of the GOI share of petroleum produced from the Ravva oil field has been a matter of disagreement for some years and the disputed issues were put to arbitration in 2002 with a view to binding all parties to the arbitration panels decision.
The arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as favourable as had been hoped.
Consequently a further provision has now been made in the financial statements per note 4 e and note 20 a.
The GOI however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts against one issue the ONGC carry which the panel found in Cairns favour.
This one issue has the largest economic impact.
Cairn has challenged both the GOIs right to appeal, and the grounds of that appeal.
If the GOI were successful on both these points, it is unclear what process would then follow to resolve the original issue under dispute.
Cairn will defend its right to continue to refer to the existing arbitration panel, whose composition and Terms of Reference were agreed by all parties at the outset.
In the event that the GOIs appeal succeeded and a process then ensued which concluded with the arbitration award on the ONGC carry being reversed in a manner and a forum which Cairn accepted as binding, then Cairn would be due to pay an additional $63.9m.
As the GOI share of profit petroleum is now agreed by all to have reached maximum entitlement, there would be no additional impact on Cairns reserves.
b Texuna International Limited Cairn is no longer in dispute with Texuna International Limited in connection with the unsuccessful joint bid for a number of blocks in Turkmenistan.
31 Post Balance Sheet Event In March 2005, the transaction completed with ONGC whereby Cairn farmed-out interests in Blocks KG-DWN-98 2 90% and CB OS-2 15% exploration interest and 10% interest in the Lakshmi and Gauri Development Areas and farmed-in interests in Blocks GV-ONN-97 1 30% and CB-ONN-2001 1 30%.
On completion, Cairn received pre tax proceeds of $135m.
The operating profits from the farmed-out interests in the CB OS-2 producing interest have been recognised in the profit and loss account up to the date of completion.
