For future acquisitions, this will generally year and subsequent reporting periods in accordance with International result in an additional provision for deferred tax with a corresponding Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The main conceptual differences increase in the amounts attributed to the acquired assets and or identified to date between UK GAAP and IFRS, insofar as Rio Tinto is goodwill.
However, on first adoption, IFRS permits the presentation of concerned, are likely to be: deferred tax provisions relating to acquisitions in previous periods as either a reduction in shareholders funds or an increase in the carrying Foreign exchange gains losses on debt value of acquired assets.
The Group finances its operations primarily through US dollar debt, a Under IFRS, full provision must be made for tax arising on significant proportion of which is located in operations whose functional unremitted earnings from subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, currency is not the US dollar.
Under UK GAAP, US dollar debt is dealt except to the extent that the Group can control the timing of remittances with in the context of the currency status of the Group as a whole, and and remittance is not probable in the foreseeable future.
Under UK exchange differences reported by these operations are adjusted through GAAP, tax is only provided on unremitted earnings to the extent that reserves.
IFRS permits these exchange gains and losses to be taken to dividends have been accrued or if there is a binding agreement for the reserves only to the extent that the US dollar debt is an effective hedge distribution of earnings at the reporting date.

Exchange gains and losses that The basis for determining whether joint ventures are accounted for using do not meet these criteria will therefore be recorded in the Group IFRS the gross equity method, or included in the financial statements on a profit and loss account, which will continue to be expressed in US line by line basis in proportion to the investors interest proportional dollars: shareholders funds will be unaffected by this reclassification.
consolidation, differs under IFRS from UK GAAP.
As a result, certain joint ventures which were previously accounted for using the equity method will Derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting under IFRS be proportionally consolidated under IFRS.
In addition there are a number The Group is party to derivative contracts in respect of some of its future of investments, proportionally consolidated under UK GAAP, which may transactions in order to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in exchange be accounted for using either proportional consolidation or the equity rates against the US dollar.
Under UK GAAP, these contracts are method under IFRS.
The most appropriate presentation for these accounted for as hedges: gains and losses are deferred and investments is currently being considered.
There will be no effect on net subsequently recognised when the hedged transaction occurs.
earnings or shareholders funds as a result of this reclassification.
However, certain of the Groups derivative contracts will not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS because the hedge is not located in the Dividends declared after reporting date entity with the exposure.
These contracts will be marked to market Under IFRS, dividends that do not represent a present obligation at the under IFRS, thereby giving rise to charges or credits to the profit and reporting date are not accrued for in the balance sheet.
Hence, the loss account in periods before the hedged transaction is recognised.
companies proposed dividends will not be recognised in the Group accounts until the period in which they are declared payable by the Derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting under IFRS directors.
Unrealised gains and losses on derivatives hedging future transactions are not shown on the balance sheet under UK GAAP.
Under IAS 39, Non amortisation of goodwill Financial Instruments: Recognition and measurement, all derivatives will The systematic amortisation of goodwill under UK GAAP, by an annual be marked to market and recognised on the balance sheet.
For cash charge to the profit and loss account, will cease under IFRS, to be flow hedges where derivatives provide an effective hedge against replaced with annual impairment reviews.
Due to the finite life of mining forecast transactions and firm commitments, unrealised gains and assets, impairment charges relating to goodwill are expected to arise in losses will be recorded on the balance sheet and deferred in future reporting periods.
Charges for impairment of goodwill are likely to shareholders funds.
When realised, these gains and losses will be fluctuate more between periods than UK GAAP goodwill amortisation recycled to the profit and loss account, or set against the cost of the charges.
Unrealised gains and losses on fair value hedges will be recognised in the profit and loss account and offset against the Impairment corresponding gains and losses on the hedged item.
There are certain differences between IFRS and UK GAAP in the basis for quantifying impairment charges against fixed assets.
These Post retirement benefits differences may impact on the impairment reviews previously conducted For UK GAAP, the Group applies SSAP 24, Accounting for Pension under UK GAAP.
Post retirement benefit surpluses deficits are spread on a straight line basis over the expected average remaining service lives of relevant Share based payments current employees.
The basis of calculating the surplus or deficit under Currently under UK GAAP, no cost is recognised in respect of share IAS 19 differs from SSAP 24.
Under the current IAS 19, Employee based payments provided that, where the strike price is below the Benefits, as amended in 2004, there are three alternative ways in which market price at the date of issue, the option scheme applies to all the surplus or deficit can be recognised.
It is probable that the Group relevant employees and the intention is to satisfy the exercise of options will choose to recognise actuarial gains and losses directly in by the issue of new shares.
IFRS requires the economic cost of all share shareholders funds via the Statement of Recognised Income and based payments to employees of the Group to be recognised by Expense.
This treatment is similar to the new UK standard FRS 17, reference to fair value on the grant date, and charged to the profit and Retirement Benefits.
The FRS 17 disclosures included in the financial loss account over the expected vesting period.
statements on pages 129 to 134 therefore give an indication of the effect of adopting this alternative on the Groups 2004 profit and loss account.
IAS 19 as amended in 2004 is yet to be endorsed by the European Union.
However, we are assuming that this standard will be endorsed before 31 December 2005.
Deferred tax UK GAAP requires the provision of deferred tax on fair value adjustments to monetary items, and downward fair value adjustments to non monetary items.
IFRS requires deferred tax to be recognised on all fair value adjustments, other than those recorded as goodwill, including 144 Rio Tinto 2004 Annual report and financial statements INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS Rio Tinto share ownership As at 14 February 2005 TWENTY LARGEST SHAREHOLDERS RIO TINTO PLC Number of Percentage RIO TINTO LIMITED Number of Percentage shares of issued shares of issued share share capital capital 1 BNY Nominees Limited 128,983,028 12.07 1 Tinto Holdings Australia Pty Limited 187,439,520 37.52 2 Chase Nominees Limited 47,554,868 4.45 2 National Nominees Limited 45,071,472 9.02 3 HSBC Global Custody Nominee 3 JP Morgan Nominees Australia Limited 44,527,685 8.91 UK Limited 357206 28,833,545 2.70 4 Westpac Custodian Nominees Limited 42,274,410 8.46 4 Credit Lyonnais SA 22,438,646 2.1 5 Citicorp Nominees Pty Limited 11,875,963 2.38 5 Prudential Client HSBC GIS Nominee 6 Anz Nominees Limited 11,019,930 2.21 UK Limited PAC 21,436,365 2.00 7 Cogent Nominees Pty Limited 7,203,002 1.44 6 State Street Nominees 8 Queensland Investment Corporation 6,484,928 1.30 Limited OM02 19,457,648 1.82 9 RBC Global Services Australia 7 The Bank of New York Nominees Nominees Pty Limited 3,595,894 0.72 Limited 17,435,234 1.63 10 HSBC Custody Nominees Australia 8 Nortrust Nominees Limited SLEND 16,482,434 1.54 Limited 3,585,137 0.72 9 Nutraco Nominees Limited 14,215,117 1.33 11 AMP Life Limited 3,146,536 0.63 10 Chase Nominees Limited LEND 13,423,782 1.26 12 Citicorp Nominees Pty Limited 11 BNY OCS Nominees Limited 11,998,130 1.12 CFS WSLE GEARED SHR FND A C 3,094,846 0.62 12 Chase Nominees Limited BGILIFEL 11,889,623 1.11 13 Citicorp Nominees Pty Limited 13 Chase GA Group Nominees CFS WSLE IMPUTATION FND A C 2,890,455 0.58 Limited GA 11,659,302 1.09 14 UBS Nominees Pty Ltd 14 HSBC Global Custody Nominees PRIME BROKING A C 2,636,088 0.53 UK Limited 899877 11,256,295 1.05 15 ANZ Nominees Limited 2,301,363 0.46 15 Nortrust Nominees Limited 10,693,371 1.00 16 RBC Global Services Australia Nominees 16 State Street Nominees Pty Limited PIPOOLED A C 2,190,759 0.44 Limited HG18 10,350,000 0.97 17 IAG Nominees Pty Limited 2,154,975 0.43 17 State Street Nominees Limited E802 9,373,275 0.88 18 Westpac Financial Services Limited 2,060,695 0.41 18 BNP Paribas Arbitrage SNC 2890000 9,179,784 0.86 19 RBC Global Services Australia Nominees 19 Chase Nominees Limited USRESLD 8,748,512 0.82 Pty Limited 1,946,255 0.39 20 Mellon Nominees UK Limited 20 Citicorp Nominees Pty Limited BSDTGUSD 8,492,230 0.79 CFS IMPUTATION FUND A C 1,881,535 0.38 433,901,189 40.59 387,381,448 77.55 a As far as is known, Rio Tinto is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by e Under the listing rules, any shareholder of Rio Tinto plc with a beneficial interest of another corporation or by any government.

MINING AND TECHNICAL DEFINITIONS Alumina Aluminium oxide.
It is extracted from bauxite in a chemical refining process and is subsequently the principal raw material in the electro-chemical process by which aluminium is produced.
Anode copper At the final stage of the smelting of copper concentrates, molten copper is cast into specially shaped slabs called anodes for subsequent electrolytic refining to produce refined cathode copper.
Bauxite Mainly hydrated aluminium oxides Al O.
Principal ore of alumina, the raw material from which 2 3 2 aluminium is made.
Beneficiated bauxite Bauxite ore that has been treated to remove waste material to improve its physical or chemical characteristics.
Bioleaching The deliberate use of bacteria to speed the chemical release of metals from ores.
Block caving An underground bulk mining method.
It involves undercutting the orebody to induce ore fracture and collapse by gravity.
The broken ore is recovered mechanically through draw points below.
Borates A generic term for mineral compounds which contain boron and oxygen.
Cathode copper Refined copper produced by electrolytic refining of impure copper or by electrowinning.
Classification Separating crushed and ground ore into portions of different size particles.
Coking coal Also referred to as metallurgical coal.
By virtue of its carbonisation properties, it is used in the manufacture of coke, which is used in the steel making process.
Concentrate The product of a physical concentration process, such as flotation or gravity concentration, which involves separating ore minerals from unwanted waste rock.
Concentrates require subsequent processing, such as smelting or leaching, to break down or dissolve the ore minerals and obtain the desired elements, usually metals.
Cutoff grade The lowest grade of mineralised material considered economic to process.
It is used in the calculation of the quantity of ore present in a given deposit.
Dor A precious metal alloy which is produced by smelting.
Dor is an intermediate product which is subsequently refined to produce pure gold and silver.
DWT Dead weight tons is the combined weight in long tons 2,240 pounds weight of cargo, fuel and fresh water that a ship can carry.
Flotation A method of separating finely ground minerals using a froth created in water by specific reagents.
In the flotation process certain mineral particles are induced to float by becoming attached to bubbles of froth whereas others, usually unwanted, sink.
Grade The proportion of metal or mineral present in ore, or any other host material, expressed in this document as per cent, grams per tonne or ounces per tonne.
Head grade The average grade of ore delivered to the mill.
Rio Tinto 2004 Annual report and financial statements 147 DEFINITIONS AND EXCHANGE RATES Definitions continued Ilmenite Mineral composed of iron, titanium and oxygen.
Mineral resource Material of intrinsic economic interest occurring in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Ore A rock from which a metal s or mineral s can be economically extracted.
Ore milled The quantity of ore processed.
Ore hoisted The quantity of ore which is removed from an underground mine for processing.
Ore reserve That part of a mineral deposit which could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination.
Pressure oxidation A method of treating sulphide ores.
In the case of refractory gold ores, the object is to oxidise the sulphides to sulphates and hence liberate the gold for subsequent cyanide leaching.
The technique involves reaction of the ore with sulphuric acid under pressure in the presence of oxygen gas.
Probable ore reserves Reserves for which quantity and grade and or quality are computed from information similar to that used for proved reserves, but the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced.
The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proved reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
Proved ore reserves Reserves for which a quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes: grade and or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling and b the sites for inspection, sampling and measurement are spaced so closely and the geologic character is so well defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
Rock mined The quantity of ore and waste rock excavated from the mine.
In this document, the term is only applied to surface mining operations.
Rutile A mineral composed of titanium and oxygen TiO.
2 Stripping ratio The tonnes of waste material which must be removed to allow the mining of one tonne of ore. Solvent extraction Processes for extracting metal from an ore and producing pure metal.
First the metal is leached into and electrowinning SX-EW solution: the resulting solution is then purified in the solvent extraction process: the solution is then treated in an electro-chemical process electrowinning to recover cathode copper.
Tailing The rock wastes which are rejected from a concentrating process after the recoverable valuable minerals have been extracted.
Thermal coal Also referred to as steam or energy coal.
It is used as a fuel source in electrical power generation, cement manufacture and various industrial applications.
Titanium dioxide A feedstock rich in titanium dioxide, produced, in Rio Tintos case, by smelting ores containing titanium feedstock minerals.
4 Notes Ore reserve estimates in this document have been adjusted for mining losses and dilution during extraction.
Metal grades have not been adjusted for mill recoveries, but mill recoveries are presented in the table of reserves and are taken into consideration in the calculation of Rio Tintos share of recoverable metal.
Unless stated to the contrary, reserves of industrial minerals and coal are stated in terms of recoverable quantities of saleable material, after processing or beneficiation losses.
Reserve and resource terminology used in this document complies in general with the requirements of the Australian Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange.

2 Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review Chief executives report We saw very strong demand across our product range in 2004.
This momentum is expected to continue into 2005 though it may be affected by the uncertainties of the US economy and the rate of growth in China.
Good market conditions enable us to increase focus on capital management.
Our record cash flow gives us considerable options for further organic growth based on our large reserve and resource position.
Operating performance Product group earnings, excluding exceptional items, were a record US$2,544 million, compared with US$1,584 million in 2003.
Higher metal and mineral prices and greater output from new projects were the main reasons for the strong result.
Improved prices, mainly for copper, aluminium, iron ore and coal, combined with additional output from new or expanded projects such as Diavik in Canada diamonds, Eastern Range, West Angelas and Hail Creek in Australia iron ore and coking coal, and Escondida in Chile copper.
The depreciation of the US dollar against most major currencies had an effect on earnings, as did higher operating costs.
While the mining industry benefits from higher prices received for the commodities we produce, as a business we also incur higher Our record cash flow prices for consumables used in our operations.
To address cost factors more rigorously, we are evolving our gives us considerable options for business processes to take advantage of Rio Tintos scale and to share leading practices around the Group as key levers to creating value.
We have been successful in applying these principles in our further organic growth information technology, procurement and shipping activities.
We are working to extend greater capability and sharing of expertise to based on our large reserve mining and processing operations, asset management and marketing, to maximise value on several fronts.
and resource position In 2004 I announced a major reallocation of product group responsibilities.
With the retirement of David Klingner as head of Exploration and Chris Renwick as chief executive, Iron Ore, Tom Albanese moved to Copper and Exploration, Sam Walsh to Iron Ore, Oscar Groeneveld to Aluminium, and Andrew Mackenzie was recruited to be chief executive Industrial Minerals.
Preston Chiaro and Keith Johnson continue as chief executives of Energy and Diamonds respectively.
Both David Klingner and Chris Renwick spent most of their working lives with Rio Tinto, each with 35 years service, making very valuable contributions in several areas of the business.
Strategy Earlier this year the board discussed Rio Tintos strategic direction to provide a framework for our medium term decisions.
The discussion reaffirmed our focus on mining operations to produce minerals and metals.
Furthermore, we recognised that medium term growth will be biased towards growth from within the development of brownfield and greenfield projects inherent in our existing assets.
The Group has long maintained a commitment to exploration.
I believe this is an increasingly important source of competitive advantage.
The Groups diversity and strength, particularly in Australia and North America, enable us to increase our involvement in less familiar territories of the world should opportunities present themselves.
The centre of gravity of our operations has been firmly in the OECD countries where historically we have found the most opportunities.
This need not always be the case.
The generation of Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review 3 Chief executives report continued options globally is an important pathway to growth and we possess Currently we have ten under way, and three more were approved the technical, community and environmental management capabilities late in 2004.
In addition, we have development studies progressing to do so.
Also, a key building block will remain our ability to bring well on 15 more projects.
Our level of success reflects efforts we have thought out projects to fruition on time without compromising their made over a number of years and is a tangible result of our performance.

Hamersley Iron has two mines, Channar and Eastern Range, demand for iron ore. which were developed in joint venture with the Chinese steel industry.
While China is the largest and In 2004, Rio Tinto strengthened trading links with China by concluding long term sales contracts for the supply of an additional fastest growing market, the 40 million tonnes of iron ore annually.
As a result, Hamersley Iron Japanese steel industry is Rio Tinto:100 per cent and Robe River Rio Tinto: 53 per cent together operating at capacity and steel now have about 85 million tonnes of ore a year committed to China.

Rio Tintos Pilbara undertaken by the Group in recent times with US$1.3 billion based iron ore mines are ideally committed to port, rail and mine expansion projects.
The biggest of placed to benefit from this massive the projects began in 2004 with the US$700 million Dampier Port growth in demand, making the Upgrade to increase shipping capacity.

increased tonnage to be unloaded and stockpiled at the port.
An ore wharf extension, deepening of the vessel berths and the installation of a second ship loader will allow three vessels to be berthed at the wharf and two vessels to be loaded simultaneously.
By the time the work is substantially completed at the end of 2005, Dampiers export capacity will have risen from 74 million tonnes to 116 million tonnes a year.
Consideration is also being given to expanding the port facilities at Cape Lambert further to increase the regions ore export capacity.
There are a number of projects occurring simultaneously to increase mine production.
A US$200 million expansion of Hamersley Irons Yandicoogina mine should be completed by mid 2005.
It will increase the mines production capacity from 24 million to 36 million tonnes a year.
This comes on top of the opening of Hamersleys ten million tonnes a year Eastern Range mine, 6 Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review Right: Inspecting a stockpile of iron ore. Products are blended to meet the needs of steel mill customers.

completed in 2004 at a cost of US$67 million.
Meanwhile, a US$105 million development currently being carried out at Robe Rivers West Angelas mine will boost capacity there from 20 million tonnes to 25 million tonnes a year.
At present, one of the factors that is inhibiting the achievement of greater export tonnages is a bottleneck in the rail system operated by Pilbara Rail Company to transport ore from nine mines to the three shipping terminals.
Most of the rail network is single track and its capacity will be greatly enhanced by a US$200 million project now in hand to install dual track along 145 kilometres of the main line.
Taken together, these and other associated investment projects will lift the iron ore production capacity at Hamersley Iron and Robe Rivers operations from the approximately 100 million tonnes produced in 2003 to more than 170 million tonnes by 2006.
Depending on market demand and the outcome of studies being carried out at the Nammuldi, Marandoo and Tom Price mines, that figure could eventually rise to more than 180 million tonnes a year.
Two new corporate entities have been formed to ensure that Hamersley Iron and Robe River operate in a responsive, and efficient manner and that the expansion projects are brought to fruition on time and within budget.
Pilbara Iron, an initiative agreed last year between Rio Tinto and its three Japanese partners in Robe River, was created to optimise the use of Hamersley Iron and Robe Rivers existing assets.
It will manage, maintain and operate the two companies port, rail, power and infrastructure assets and will also provide a range of corporate and site services.
The second new company, Rio Tinto Expansion Projects, has brought together a several hundred strong team, whose specialist skills in project management, evaluation, design and construction will be used to ensure that Rio Tinto gets maximum value out of the new investments.

As a producer of high quality coal for steel production, one of Hail After the first commercial shipments in October 2003, RTCAs Creeks particular strengths is its flexibility to respond to changes in coking coal mine at Hail Creek ramped up to its production market circumstances.
This is because it is capable of producing two capacity of 5.5 million tonnes per annum during 2004. coking coal products a standard medium ash coking coal and a high value, low ash coal for those customers willing to pay a premium.
Growth is foreseen in the demand for coking coal, in particular from China.
Rio Tinto Coal Australia has already started expansion of Hail Creeks production capacity to eight million tonnes per year at a cost of US$157 million.
The project is relatively straightforward with permits already in place for the higher level of production.
The project is scheduled to be completed in the first half of 2006 and will further strengthen Rio Tintos position in the coking coal export market.
Studies are under way to increase production beyond eight million tonnes.
The current expansion of Hail Creek is largely underpinned by a long term sales agreement entered into by Nippon Steel of Japan to purchase 30 million tonnes of coking coal over a period of 15 years.
Energy Nippon Steel is a partner in the Robe River Joint Venture, part of Earnings contribution Rio Tintos Iron Ore group.
As part of a raw materials package US$m combining Rio Tinto iron ore and coal, Nippon purchased an eight per cent interest in the Hail Creek Joint Venture as well as 47 per cent of the Beasley River iron ore deposit for US$150 million.
Together with production from Kestrel, the eight million tonnes a year of capacity at Hail Creek will make Rio Tinto the fourth largest coking coal producer in Australia.

Rio Tinto experience shows that incorporating all areas of decision making as early as possible in a projects feasibility analysis can multiply the benefits delivered.
Two industrial minerals projects, one on the drawing board, the other Minerals completed, illustrate this approach.
A mineral sands project being pursued by QIT Madagascar Minerals QMM in partnership with the Government of Madagascar will address future global demand for titanium feedstocks.
The deposit near Fort-Dauphin, in the south east of Madagascar, consists of three mineralised zones.
First phase production could ramp up to 750,000 tonnes per year of ilmenite and 25,000 tonnes per year of zircon.
At that rate, the three zones could support mining for over 50 years.
The sands will be mined by a conventional floating dredge.
Ahead of the dredge, the vegetation will be removed and topsoil stored for use in rehabilitation.
The dredged sand, up to 20 metres deep, will be separated by gravity into five per cent heavy minerals and 95 per cent residual silica sand.
The heavy mineral concentrate will then be processed into ilmenite and zircon.
The residual minerals are returned to fill in the mining pond.
The ilmenite and zircon will be trucked about 15 km along a new road to a new port for shipment to one of Rio Tintos upgrading facilities or for sale Multiplying the benefits Rio Tinto experience shows that incorporating all areas of decision making as early as possible in a projects feasibility analysis can multiply the benefits delivered.

Rio Tinto is unique among the worlds large scale producers of rough diamonds in that it concentrates on mining and has no involvement in diamond cutting, jewellery manufacture or retailing.
Nevertheless, the Group assumes stewardship of its products throughout the supply chain.
The chain of custody system is particularly relevant in the context of the Kimberley Process an inter-governmental protocol established at the behest of the United Nations that aims to prevent the sale of conflict diamonds.
These diamonds originate from areas controlled by forces opposed to legitimate and internationally recognised governments and are often used to fund military action against those governments, or in contravention of the decisions of the UN Security Council.
Although conflict diamonds were estimated at their peak to represent no more than four per cent of the global diamond trade, their presence on the market was having a disproportionately damaging effect on the image and interests of the legitimate majority of the industry.
The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme KPCS was put in place in 2003 to help answer this problem.
It was the culmination of two years intensive cooperation among governments and the diamond industry, and Rio Tinto was one of the first companies to endorse it.
Essentially, the KPCS is an international system of physical checks and document trails which provide a reliable means of tracing the ownership and movements of rough diamonds.
Today the scheme is supported by 43 member countries and accounts for about 98 per cent of the worlds diamond trade.
Although Rio Tinto is not itself directly involved in the cut diamond and gold jewellery sector, it believes strongly in the concept of responsible product stewardship throughout the supply chain.
In 2004, we demonstrated this by becoming one of the ten founding signatories of an initiative launched in November by the Diamonds Earnings contribution US$m 00 01 02 03 04 Traditional land owners at the Argyle mine in Australia signed a participation agreement in 2004 that was three years in the making.

The Exploration group seeks to discover or identify mineral resources that will contribute to the growth of the Rio Tinto Group.
The discovery of new resources is essential to replace deposits as they are mined and to help meet the increasing global demand for minerals and metals.
The Exploration group is opportunistic in approach and its resources are deployed on projects that show the best chance of delivering a world class deposit to Rio Tinto.
Mineral exploration is a high risk activity.
Rio Tintos statistics show that an average of only one in 350 mineral prospects that are drill tested result in a mine for the Group.
Rio Tinto believes in having a critical mass of projects, selected through a rigorous process of prioritisation.
The group is organised into four geographically based teams and a fifth team that looks for industrial minerals on a global basis.
Additionally, a small focused project generation team covers the world for new opportunities.

Several projects are in the process of initiating order of magnitude studies to assess their economic potential for advancement to prefeasibility assessment.
An order of magnitude study was commenced at the La Sampala nickel laterite resource in Indonesia, and is nearing completion.
Diamond exploration continued in Canada, southern Africa, Mauritania, Brazil and India.
A number of diamond bearing kimberlite pipes were discovered and follow up test work is in progress to gauge economic potential.
Copper exploration continued in Turkey, Peru, Chile, Argentina and the US.
Copper mineralisation was encountered in drilling in projects in Turkey and Peru, which warrant further follow up drill testing.
The group was active in the search for industrial mineral deposits in a number of parts of the world including North and South America, Europe, south east Asia and Turkey.
We continued to support brownfield work at a number of Rio Tinto operations.
Exploration in the vicinity of the Argyle diamond mine continued.
In the US and Argentina, active programmes were conducted in the vicinity of the Boron and Tincalayu mines.
In Indonesia, exploration in and around the Grasberg mine led to the addition of further copper reserves.
Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review 19 HItech HIsmelt Rio Tintos future success depends on the skills of its people and the quality of its mineral resources.
Of no less importance is the quality of the technology that it deploys in harvesting that mineral wealth.
Illustrating Rio Tintos leading position in technology is the HIsmelt process, a new approach to iron smelting that will provide the iron and steel industry with a more cost effective and environmentally superior alternative iron making process.
In the next few months, the first commercial size HIsmelt plant at Kwinana near Perth in Western Australia will be commissioned, at a cost of US$200 million, so bringing to fruition 22 years research and development work.
First hot metal is expected to be produced by the end of the first quarter of 2005 after which it is planned the plant will ramp up to 60 per cent of capacity in the first year, 90 per cent in the second, to reach full capacity in the third of 800,000 tonnes per year.
Until now, the blast furnaces which smelt iron ore to produce pig iron have suffered from a number of drawbacks.
For example, the feed for the furnace has to be in the form of pellets or sinter, whose preparation adds an extra stage and cost to the whole operation.
Traditional blast furnaces also have to be fed with coke rather than coal, which means that coke ovens are needed, adding further to the overall capital cost of the smelting operation.
The HIsmelt process, on the other hand, is a direct iron making method that avoids the need for sinter or pellet plants and coking ovens.
Instead it converts iron ore to high quality liquid pig iron through the injection of ordinary non coking coal and fine iron ore into a bath of molten iron.
It can be considered both as a potential replacement for the blast furnace and as a new source of low cost iron units for the electric arc steel making industry.
Nor should the environmental benefits of HIsmelt be overlooked.
Doing away with sinter and pellet plants and coking ovens means that the large amounts of energy consumed by these processes and the greenhouse gases, nitrous oxides and sulphur bearing gases that they would have emitted are avoided.
A further benefit is that HIsmelt can be used to smelt steel plant wastes efficiently.
HIsmelt therefore represents a lower cost, more environmentally efficient alternative to conventional iron making technology.
The technology has all of the attributes required for the ideal iron production process: great flexibility in feed materials, low capital intensity and high operational flexibility and lower operating costs than conventional technology.
As smaller, traditional blast furnaces increasingly become uneconomic owing to rising infrastructure and coking coal costs, the HIsmelt process will offer an alternative for which outputs of less than one million tonnes a year should be commercially viable.
It is therefore attractive to the growing industrial regions of south east Asia and indeed to other steel producing areas.
HIsmelt at Kwinana operates as a joint venture between Rio Tinto 60 per cent, Nucor, one of the USs biggest steelmakers 25 per cent, Japans Mitsubishi Corporation, a major international trading company ten per cent and a leading Chinese steelmaker, Shougang Corporation five per cent.
The technology has already been licensed to two companies, and a number of others have expressed a keen interest in accessing the technology.
20 Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review Technology Supporting the drive for excellence The charge for the Technology group against net earnings was US$25 million, compared with US$16 million in 2003.
The increase was mainly due to the weaker US dollar and the greater level of activity in all Technology group units.
The Technology group provides technical assistance to Rio Tintos product groups and their businesses, and advises executive management.
In support of the drive towards operational excellence, a key focus is to identify and implement best practices, to improve safety and environmental performance, maximise operating efficiency and add value across Rio Tinto.
Technology staff include experienced professionals covering all the main industry related disciplines, while the Office of the Chief Technologist manages the Groups involvement in external and collaborative research.
The total staff in the Technology group at year end was 343 compared with 325 in 2003.
Technical Services continued to increase its involvement with Rio Tinto operations and also provided significant contributions at non managed operations.
Activity over the year was again at record levels, with a strong focus on the enhancement of initiatives to improve business unit performance and implement best practice such as in water management and metallurgical margin improvement.
New initiatives recently commenced include Excellence in Mine Planning and Resource Management.
The Office of the Chief Technologist is responsible for the identification and the transfer of technology based opportunities for the Group.
The external research portfolio covers a broad range of industry related initiatives some of which link directly with internal development projects.
Work on improving efficiency and reducing costs is continuing in areas such as comminution, water usage and materials handling.
A number of breakthrough projects are also being pursued.
Technical Evaluation continued in its principal role of providing independent review of all major investment proposals being considered by the Group.
Risk assessment and management is an important and integral component of the project review process.
The unit also continued with the programme of post investment reviews, and has established a database system to consolidate the findings so that lessons learned from completed projects can be shared within the Group.
The Project Management Unit provides ongoing support to major project teams across Rio Tinto, both for projects in execution and those still in the feasibility stage.
There was also continued involvement with some major projects at non managed operations.
Asset Utilisation is now well established across the Group and its workload continued to expand.
There has been particularly heavy involvement with the iron ore operations in Western Australia which is expected to continue through 2005.
The process control group is now well established, and the development of tools to improve performance continues, such as asset integrity and remote monitoring.
There is continuing emphasis on ensuring that safety, operability and maintainability issues are fully addressed and incorporated in all the units work.
Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review 21 Sustainable development Joining the conservation debate November 2004 saw the public launch in Bangkok of Rio Tintos Biodiversity Strategy at the worlds largest conservation gathering, held every four years.
The World Conservation Congress is the official policy making event of the IUCN the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources.
It attracted nearly 5,000 delegates from across a spectrum of conservation interests, providing a good opportunity to profile the results of the Groups work over the last five years in developing capacity to manage biodiversity, and identifying the principles and practices that will deliver long term environmental benefit and business value in the future.
The strategy is a response to societys expectations of the mining industry with regard to biodiversity.
It provides a framework for operations to bring together the interests and concerns of many affected groups including indigenous landowners, local communities, investors, employees, NGOs, regulators, scientific and finance communities so that their interests and concerns are addressed and best practices are consolidated and progressed.
This should deliver long term business value by enabling Rio Tinto to better understand biodiversity issues and their local and regional social context, and ensure that projects address these issues equitably, effectively and profitably.
First among the principles is Rio Tintos aim to have a net positive effect on biodiversity.
The route lies in minimising the negative impacts of its activities, and making appropriate contributions to conservation in the regions where it operates.
Also central to the strategy is a firm commitment to integrating biodiversity issues and considerations into every phase of the business cycle, from planning and decision making to operating and reporting.
Other commitments include conservation of threatened species, consultation with all interested parties, and the use of appropriate expertise and resources whether internal or external for solving biodiversity issues.
The launch of the strategy provoked detailed discussion at a platform session open to both members and non-members of the IUCN during the forum.
Many saw the strategy as representing a leading position in the extractive industries.
Others held the view that conservation and capitalism are mutually incompatible.
However, the general feeling was that the debate has moved on, Left: Lemurs in Madagascar.
Rio Tinto is working with conservation partners to establish protected forest zones in the vicinity of a mineral sands project.

Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review 23 The way we work Rio Tinto is in business to create value by finding and developing world class mineral deposits and operating and eventually closing operations safely, responsibly and efficiently.
To do so, we take a disciplined and integrated approach to the economic, social and environmental aspects of all our activities.
Our approach to achieving this is through implementation of the policies described in The way we work, our statement of business practice, at all levels of the business.
The statement, redistributed in 2003 in 19 languages, is the result of many months of wide internal consultation and discussion and represents shared values from around the Group.
The document was published initially in January 1998, and revised in the light of experience in 2002, following further Group wide review and consultation, external benchmarking of policies against the best practice of other organisations, and approval by the Rio Tinto board.
The way we work commits the Group to transparency consistent with normal commercial confidentiality, corporate accountability, and the application of appropriate standards and internal controls.
It sets the basis for how Group companies employees work and also provides guidance for joint venture partners and others.
Every employee is responsible for implementing the policies in the document.
Rio Tinto has adopted the Association of British Insurers 2003 disclosure guidelines on social responsibility in preparing this report.
Details of the Groups overall and individual businesses social and environmental performance continue to be published on the Rio Tinto website: www.

24 Rio Tinto 2004 Annual review with many conservation groups now actively interested in working with corporate organisations to find solutions to managing biodiversity.
Rio Tinto representatives engaged in the conservation debate in several additional sessions at the congress.
These included a workshop on business and biodiversity partnerships, where the positive value of pursuing partnerships such as Rio Tinto with Kew Gardens, London and BirdLife International was clearly demonstrated.
A session on good practice guidance for the mining and metals industry was jointly organised by the International Council on Mining and Metals ICMM, of which Rio Tinto was a founding member, and the IUCN.
The presentations and subsequent discussion showed that Rio Tinto is already comfortable with commitments and processes beyond the point at which the ICMM is currently positioning itself.
At the congress exhibition Rio Tinto distributed copies of the Biodiversity Strategy, and team members engaged in discussion with members of non government organisations looking to engage with conservation performance leaders in industrial sectors.
The content and quality of discussion at the forum showed just how far the conservation debate had progressed, although certain issues still have different priorities in the business and conservation communities.
The trend gives Rio Tinto encouragement that greater opportunities for constructive debate and learning will flow from its commitment to achieve a leading position in the management of biodiversity.
