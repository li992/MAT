Financial Statements Statement of Directors responsibilities in relation to the Financial Statements The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the auditors statement of auditors responsibilities set out in their report, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the Directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the Groups profit or loss and cash flows for the financial year.
The Directors consider that in preparing the financial statements the Company and the Group have used appropriate accounting policies, consistently applied and supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed.
The Directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position of the Company and the Group, and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The Directors have general responsibilities for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors Report Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting firm to the Members of Cadbury Schweppes plc We have audited the financial statements of Cadbury Schweppes plc for the year ended 2 January 2005, which comprise the Group and Company Balance Sheets as at 2 January 2005 and 28 December 2003, the Group Profit and Loss Accounts, the Group Cash Flow Statements, the Statements of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders Funds for the years ended 2 January 2005, 28 December 2003 and 29 December 2002 and the related geographical analysis and notes 1 to 32.
These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration that is described as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors As described in the Statement of Directors responsibilities, the Companys Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information contained in the Report & Accounts and Form 20-F including the Report on Directors Remuneration.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited in accordance with relevant United Kingdom legal and regulatory requirements and auditing standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
We also report to you if, in our opinion, the directors report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors remuneration and transactions with the Company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Companys compliance with the nine provisions of the July 2003 FRC Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not.
We are not required to consider whether the Board's statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the Report of the Directors and the other information contained in the Report & Accounts and Form 20-F for the year ended 2 January 2005 as described in the contents section including the unaudited part of the Report on Directors Remuneration and consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board and with standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board United States.
An audit includes consideration of internal control over financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Companys internal control over financial reporting.
Accordingly, we express no such opinion.
An audit also includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the circumstances of the Company and the Group, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
88 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
In forming our opinion, we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited.
UK Opinion In our opinion: the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group at 2 January 2005 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended: and the financial statements and that part of the Report on Directors Remuneration described as having been audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.
US Opinion In our opinion the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Group at 2 January 2005 and 28 December 2003 and the consolidated results of its operations and cash flows for the years ended 2 January 2005, 28 December 2003 and 29 December 2002 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom.
As explained in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Group has given retroactive effect to the change in accounting as a result of the adoption of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom vary in significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
Information relating to the nature and effect of such differences is presented in Note 31 to the financial statements.
Deloitte & Touche LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors London, England 11 March 2005 Notes: An audit does not provide assurance on the maintenance and integrity of the website, including controls used to achieve this, and in particular on whether any changes may have occurred to the financial statements since first published.
These matters are the responsibility of the directors but no control procedures can provide absolute assurance in this area.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.
