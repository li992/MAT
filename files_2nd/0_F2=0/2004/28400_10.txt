Directors remuneration report continued 7 Pensions and life assurance continued 7.5 The executive directors other than John Harnett participate in the senior pension scheme which provides pensions and other benefits within Inland Revenue limits.
The senior pension scheme provides, in respect of service from 1 January 2000, a pension of up to two-thirds of basic salary at the normal retirement date at age 60.
The pension provided in respect of service prior to 1 January 2000 is up to two-thirds of basic salary at the normal retirement date at age 60 reduced by an amount approximately equal to two-thirds of the single persons basic rate state pension from state pension age.
The senior pension scheme is contributory and directors contribute at the rate of 7% of basic salary.
7.6 Details of the pension entitlements earned during 2004 are set out below: Transfer Transfer value of value of Increase Accrued pension benefits pension benefits in transfer Age annual pension Increase in Directors accrued at accrued at value less 31 December 31 December 31 December annual pension contribution 31 December 31 December directors 2004 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 contributions Directors name 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Robin Ashton 46 154 127 23 30 30 22 1,878 1,292 556 Chris Johnstone 45 110 93 14 18 19 14 1,281 899 363 David Swann 57 176 152 19 26 19 14 3,553 2,697 837 Accrued annual pension is the pension to which the director would be entitled at his normal retirement date based on the number of years of pensionable service at 31 December 2004, assuming no further contributions after that date.
Increase in annual pension is the increase during the year in the accrued annual pension arising from the changes in pensionable service and salary, over and above any general increase to compensate for inflation 3.1%.
7.7 The senior pension scheme also provides spouses pensions of four-ninths of basic salary at date of death if the director dies in service and two-thirds of the directors pension if the director dies in retirement and lump sums on death in service of four times basic salary at date of death plus a return of the directors contributions.
If the director does not leave a spouse, the pension will be paid to any dependants at the discretion of the trustees of the senior pension scheme.
7.8 With the consent of the company, a director can retire under the senior pension scheme rules at any time between ages 50 and 60, in which case the pension payable would be the accrued pension based on salary and pensionable service at the date he leaves the service of the company reduced to reflect the longer period for which it will be paid.
7.9 Pensions in respect of service up to 1 January 2000 are guaranteed to increase, when in payment, at a rate of 5% each year.
Pensions in respect of service from 1 January 2000 are guaranteed to increase each year by the lower of the annual increase in the retail prices index and 5%.
Discretionary increases may be granted by the trustees with the consent of the company.
7.10 There are no discretionary benefits for which allowance is made when calculating transfer values on leaving service.
7.11 The senior pension scheme together with the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme was closed to employees who joined the group on or after 1 January 2003.
These employees are eligible to join the Provident Financial Stakeholder Pension Plan.
8 Directors service agreements 8.1 Four directors, Robin Ashton, Charles Gregson, John Harnett and John van Kuffeler are offering themselves for re-election at the annual general meeting AGM to be held on 24 May 2005.
Details of the service agreement of each director with the company or letter of appointment, as relevant, are set out in paragraphs 8.1.
1 Each executive director has a service agreement which requires one years notice of termination to be given by the company and one years notice of termination to be given by the director.
No notice of termination has been given by either the company or any of the directors and thus in each case the unexpired term is one year.
Each service agreement terminates on the date of the directors sixtieth birthday.
There are no provisions for compensation payable upon early termination of any of the agreements.
However, in the event that a director is not re-elected at an AGM of the company, the agreement is automatically terminated and this is treated as a breach by the company.
The dates of the service agreements are as follows: Robin Ashton 28 January 2002 amended by letter of variation on 23 December 2003 : John Harnett 30 January 2002 amended by letter of variation on 24 December 2003 : Chris Johnstone 26 April 2001 amended by letter of variation on 24 December 2003 : and David Swann 26 April 2001 amended by letter of variation on 23 December 2003.
2 The Chairman, John van Kuffeler, has a service agreement dated 29 January 2002 amended by letter of variation on 24 December 2003 which requires one years notice of termination to be given by the company and six months notice of termination to be given by him.
No notice of termination has been given by either party and thus the unexpired term is one year.
The service agreement will terminate on the date of his sixtieth birthday 9 January 2009.
Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 59 Directors remuneration report continued 8 Directors service agreements continued 8.1.
3 Each of the non-executive directors has a letter of appointment.
Each director is appointed for a fixed period of three years, subject to election by shareholders.
The initial three-year period may be extended by one further three-year period and, in exceptional cases, further extended subject to re-election by shareholders.
The dates of the letters of appointment and the unexpired terms are as follows: Charles Gregson 27 September 2004 unexpired term: to 31 May 2006: John Maxwell 1 May 2003 unexpired term: to 14 May 2006: Ray Miles 31 December 2003 unexpired term: to 31 December 2006: Graham Pimlott 26 June 2003 unexpired term: to 25 June 2006.
8.2 In 2004 payment was made to a former director Howard Bell, formerly Chief Executive as a result of the arrangements which were made when he retired from the board in 2001 pursuant to the companys succession planning.
He had a service contract which required two years notice to be given by the company.
He agreed to retire before his normal retirement dates in order to facilitate the change in board structure and agreed to enter into a new service agreement.
In considering appropriate arrangements for him, the committee took into account a number of factors: these included the need for a smooth transition in changes of management at the highest level, the benefit of retaining the facility to use his services and the need to protect the commercial interests of the group.
Howard Bell entered into a fixed term service agreement with the company as an executive under the terms of which he would continue to receive basic salary increased annually to take account of inflation and certain benefits principally a company car and pension contributions until his normal retirement date of 28 March 2004.
This contract also contained restrictive covenants to safeguard the companys interests.
In 2004 he received 88,222 in salary and 35,159 by way of other benefits including pension contributions.
In 2004 he exercised executive options granted to him in 2000 over 40,385 shares on which he made a gain of 33,116.
He has no outstanding rights to exercise options.

They have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the valuation of land and buildings at 31 December 1994.
The accounting policies are consistent with those adopted in the prior year except for the first time adoption of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
The adoption of UITF 38 has resulted in shares in Provident Financial plc held by the QUEST being reclassified from fixed asset investments to equity shareholders funds.
This has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly.
As a result, equity shareholders funds at 31 December 2004 have decreased by 8.5m 31 December 2003 10.4m and proceeds from the exercise of QUEST shares have been reclassified in the cash flow statement from capital expenditure and financial investment cash flows to financing cash flows.
There has been no impact on the performance statements of the current or previous year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the end of the financial year.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired and sold during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the dates of acquisition or to the dates of disposal.
Inter-company sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation and all sales and profit figures relate to external transactions only.
Turnover Turnover, which excludes value added tax and intra-group transactions, comprises revenue earned for the home credit businesses: premiums written net of reinsurance costs for the motor insurance underwriting business: revenue earned by Yes Car Credit on the sale of motor vehicles and associated finance and insurance contracts: and interest and fee income earned by Vanquis Bank.
Revenue recognition In the home credit businesses the fixed charge payable by the customer on the amount of credit advanced is included in the customers account balance at the inception of the instalment credit agreement and is credited as revenue earned to the profit and loss account as follows: i at the inception of the agreement, the profit and loss account is credited with a proportion of revenue to cover the cost of initial expenses: ii the balance of revenue remaining is carried forward in the balance sheet as deferred revenue, to be credited to the profit and loss account in future periods.
A small proportion of this deferred revenue, equating to the cost of financing the amount advanced, is credited to the profit and loss account in future periods on the sum of the digits method and the balance is credited proportionately to collections received.
In respect of the motor insurance underwriting business, credit is taken to the profit and loss account for premium income, net of commissions paid to intermediaries, over the life of the policy.
In the car finance business of Yes Car Credit revenue from the sale of the motor vehicle is recognised in the profit and loss account when the vehicle is sold.
Finance income is recognised as revenue earned in the profit and loss account over the life of the contract to which it relates so as to give a constant rate of return and deferred revenue is included in car finance receivables.
A portion of the net commissions from arranging insurance between customers and third party insurers is recognised as revenue immediately on the inception of the related car finance contract.
The balance is spread over the life of the associated contract in line with the outstanding credit risk.
In respect of the credit card business of Vanquis Bank, interest is calculated on credit card advances to customers on daily balances outstanding.
Fees charged to customers credit card accounts are recognised at the time the charges are made to customers on the basis that there is no recourse on these fees and performance is complete.
Provision for suspended interest and fees is made on accounts in arrears based on expected performance.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisition, being the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life which, for all acquisitions, has been estimated to be 20 years.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to the introduction of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets is eliminated against reserves.
On the subsequent disposal or closure of a business, goodwill previously eliminated against reserves is charged to the profit and loss account.
Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 66 Principal accounting policies continued Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at invoiced cost or valuation.
On adoption of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets, the group followed the transitional provisions to retain the book value of land and buildings at 31 December 1999 which were revalued in 1994 but decided not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
Costs that are directly attributable to the development of new business application software are capitalised.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the assets to their estimated realisable value over their useful lives.
The following are the principal bases used: % Method Land Nil 1 2 Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2 Straight line Short leasehold buildings Over the lease period Straight line Fixtures and fittings 10 Straight line 1 3 Equipment, including computers and capitalised software 20 to 33 Straight line Motor vehicles 25 Reducing balance Investment in own shares In accordance with UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, shares purchased through the QUEST are treated as treasury shares, held at cost and are taken as a deduction from the profit and loss reserve within equity shareholders funds.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in UITF 17 Revised 2000 Employee Share Schemes in respect of the accounting for its employee savings related option schemes which states that the requirements of the abstract need not be applied to such schemes.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Fixed assets and goodwill are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Any impairment is recognised in the profit and loss account, or revaluation reserve, as appropriate, in the year in which it occurs.
Stock Stock comprises motor vehicles held for resale and is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes transport and handling costs.
Provision for bad and doubtful debts In the home credit businesses, provision is made for all doubtful debts based on formulae which reflect the historical performance of the various categories of delinquent debtors or on the expected performance where there is insufficient historical experience.
The relevant proportion is appropriated from deferred revenue and the balance from the profit and loss account.
Full provision is made for any outstanding customer balance for which no payment has been received in the preceding 12 weeks.
Debts are written off when all reasonable steps to recover them have been taken without success.
In Yes Car Credit, provision is made for doubtful debts to reflect the directors best estimate of the number of contracts that are likely to default over the full term of each contract normally four years and the expected average loss on each contract.
In Vanquis Bank, provision for bad and doubtful debts is based on formulae which reflect the expected performance of the various categories of delinquent debtors.
These formulae apply factors which represent the estimated probabilities that balances will be irrecoverable to an aged analysis of outstanding customer credit card balances in arrears.
Investments Deposits with financial institutions are stated at cost.
Fixed interest securities, which are generally held to maturity, are valued at amortised cost.
The amortisation is calculated so as to write off the difference between the purchase price and the maturity value over the life of the security.
Gains and losses on disposals of investments are dealt with in the profit and loss account when realised.
Amounts recoverable from reinsurers An asset is recognised in respect of amounts recoverable from reinsurers to reflect expected recoveries from reinsurers relating to insurance claims made and estimated claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date.
An assessment of the recoverability of reinsurance debtors is made having regard to market data on the financial strength of each of the reinsurance companies and provision is made for amounts deemed to be irrecoverable.
Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 67 Principal accounting policies continued Provision for unpaid insurance claims Provision is made at the year end for the estimated gross cost of claims incurred but not settled at the balance sheet date, including the gross cost of claims expected to be incurred but not yet reported to the company.
The estimated cost of claims comprises expenses to be incurred in settling claims and a deduction for the expected value of salvage and other recoveries.
Provisions are calculated gross of any reinsurance recoveries.
The company takes all reasonable steps to ensure that it has appropriate information regarding its claims exposures.
However, given the uncertainty in establishing claims provisions, it is likely that the outcome will prove to be different from the original liability established.
The estimated cost of claims is calculated by reference to the projected number of claims, based on statistics showing how the number of notified claims has developed over time, and the anticipated average cost per claim, based on historical levels adjusted to allow for changes in variables such as legislation, inflation rates, the mix of business and industry benchmarks.
The provision for estimated insurance claims is reviewed annually by an external actuary.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and is determined using the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred taxation is not recognised on revalued assets unless there is a binding agreement at the balance sheet date to sell the revalued asset and the related gain has been recognised in the accounts.
Deferred taxation balances are not discounted.
Operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Pension scheme arrangements Contributions to separately administered defined benefit pension funds are charged to the profit and loss account to spread the costs of pensions over the employees working lives in line with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The regular pension costs are attributed to individual years using the projected unit method.
Variations in pension costs, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the schemes is shown as a prepayment in the balance sheet.
The group has not adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits for accounting purposes but continues to make the transitional disclosures required by that standard in the notes to the accounts.
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Profits and losses of subsidiary undertakings and branches which have currencies of operation other than sterling are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates or the contracted rate to the extent hedged.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiary undertakings and branches, that have currencies of operation other than sterling, net of any matching exchange difference on related foreign currency loans taken out to hedge overseas investments, are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are structured so as to reduce the market risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposures.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of these financial instruments are recognised as adjustments to interest payable or receivable over the periods of the contracts.
Foreign exchange contracts which hedge balance sheet assets and liabilities are revalued at closing rates and exchange differences arising are taken to reserves.
Gains and losses on contracts hedging forecast transactional cash flows are recognised in the hedged periods.
Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are classified in the cash flow statement in the same way as the transactions being hedged.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairment in their value.
Total amount payable represents credit issued in the year plus the related service charge in respect of the home credit businesses.
Goodwill amortisation in 2004 includes 4.4m in respect of Yes Car Credit 2003 4.1m and 0.2m in respect of UK home credit 2003 0.2m.
Turnover between segments is not material.
Goodwill amortisation relates to UK and Republic of Ireland.
There is no material difference between the geographical analysis of turnover by location and destination.

Market values have been used to determine the fair values of the groups derivative financial instruments.
d Hedging instruments The following table shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised and deferred gains and losses, in respect of financial instruments used as hedges, at the beginning and end of the year.
All gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
The US$ loan notes, which are fully hedged by currency swap arrangements, are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the carrying values of the loans effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instruments, which are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below: Unrecognised Deferred Total net Total net Gains Losses gains losses Gains Losses gains losses Gains and losses on hedging instruments m m m m m m At 1 January 2004 11.1 5.8 5.3 21.8 21.8 Arising in previous years that were recognised in 2004 8.0 6.2 1.8 Arising in previous years not recognised in 2004 3.1 0.4 3.5 21.8 21.8 Arising in 2004 3.6 6.7 3.1 10.0 10.0 Gains and losses on hedging instruments at 31 December 2004 6.7 6.3 0.4 31.8 31.8 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 3.0 4.6 1.6 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 3.7 1.7 2.0 31.8 31.8 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 82 Notes to the accounts continued 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued e Currency exposures As explained in the groups accounting policy, exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiary undertakings and branches, which have currencies of operation other than sterling, net of any matching exchange differences on related foreign currency loans taken out to hedge overseas investments, are taken to reserves, together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency.
Foreign exchange differences on the retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group subsidiary concerned and the group.

The total estimated amount of contingent consideration payable is 12.8m of which 1.3m is payable in more than one year see note 18.
Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, the group may make contingent consideration payments in cash to i the senior managers of Yes Car Credit at the date of acquisition the Senior Management and ii the institutional vendors.
Payment of the principal sums which may fall due is expected to be made during 2005.
The contingent consideration payments will be based upon the average of the adjusted audited profits after tax of the Yes Car Credit business for the year ending 31 December 2002 and 31 December 2003 Average Adjusted Profit after Tax AAPAT as defined in the acquisition agreement as follows: i The contingent consideration payment to the Senior Management of Yes Car Credit will be calculated as 1.97 times the AAPAT, with a cap of 37.6m which would only be payable if the AAPAT were to equal or exceed 19.38m.
ii The contingent consideration payment to the institutional vendors will be calculated as 6.0 times the surplus of the AAPAT over 3.23m, with a cap of 38m which would only be payable if the AAPAT were to equal or exceed 9.57m.
There is a range of possible outcomes of the final amount of contingent consideration payable.
12.8m represents the directors best estimate of the amount payable based on the latest information available.
Estimates of contingent consideration will be revised as further and more certain information becomes available, with corresponding adjustments to goodwill.

The nominal value of shares issued during the year was 78,319.
The aggregate consideration received in respect of all the shares issued during the year was 4.1m.
Provident Financial plc sponsors the QUEST which is a discretionary trust established for the benefit of the employees of the group.
The company has also established Provident Financial Trustees Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary undertaking, to act as trustee of the QUEST.
All costs relating to the QUEST are dealt with in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The trustee has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds.
These shares were acquired by the QUEST to meet obligations under the companys SAYE schemes.
Prior to 2004 such shares were held as an asset within fixed asset investments on the balance sheet and were written down to the price at which the option was granted in respect of each share.
The amount contributed to the QUEST in excess of the option price was charged against reserves.
Following the issue of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, such shares are treated as treasury shares, held at cost and are taken as a deduction from the profit and loss account within equity shareholders funds.
This change has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly.
As a result, equity shareholders funds of the group and company at 31 December 2004 have decreased by 8.5m 31 December 2003 10.4m and proceeds from the exercise of QUEST shares have been reclassified in the cash flow statement from capital expenditure and financial investment cash flows to financing cash flows.
The prior year adjustment has had no impact on the performance statements of the current or previous year.

The two major defined benefit schemes are the Provident Financial Senior Pension Scheme the senior pension scheme and the Provident Financial Staff Pension Scheme the staff pension scheme.
The schemes cover 82% of employees with company provided pension arrangements and are of the funded, defined benefit type.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate, trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the group was assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuations for the schemes were as at 1 June 2004 and used the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions used were that the rate of return on investments would be 2.05% per annum higher than the rate of increase in salaries for the staff pension scheme and 1.55% higher for the senior pension scheme, and 3.55% per annum higher than the rate of increase in present and future pensions for both the staff and senior pension schemes.
At the valuation date the market value of the assets of the schemes was 202.7m.
The market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 68% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
For the purposes of establishing the pension costs in the groups profit and loss account, the deficit is being amortised over the average remaining service lives of the employees who are currently members of the respective schemes.
Included in the groups balance sheet is a prepayment of 35.7m 2003 26.7m, which represents the excess of the contributions paid to the schemes over the charge in the profit and loss account.
The pension charge in the year, calculated in accordance with SSAP 24, was 10.7m 2003 6.8m.

For new employees joining the group after 1 January 2003, a stakeholder pension plan was introduced into which the company contributes 8% of pensionable earnings of the member provided that the member contributes a minimum of 6% of pensionable earnings.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the company in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost charge in the profit and loss account represents contributions payable by the group to the fund and amounted to 0.5m for the year ended 31 December 2004 2003 0.1m.
No contributions were payable to the fund at the year end 2003 nil.
b FRS 17 disclosures As noted above, the group operates two major defined benefit schemes in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary on both schemes at 1 June 2004.
The valuation used in the FRS 17 disclosures has been based on these valuations which have been updated by the actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 31 December 2004.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 31 December 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 2002 %%% Rate of increase in salaries 4.34 4.08 3.88 Rate of increase in pensions 2.75 2.50 2.40 Discount rate 5.40 5.50 5.50 Inflation assumption 2.75 2.50 2.30 The combined assets in the schemes and the expected rate of return were: Long term Long term Long term rate of return rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at expected at Value at 31 December 2004 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 31 December 2002 %m % m %m Equities 7.85 182.7 8.00 148.4 8.00 110.2 Bonds 4.60 39.5 4.50 31.6 4.50 26.2 Property 7.00 9.6 5.50 9.5 Cash and net current assets 4.80 9.8 4.25 4.5 4.00 0.9 Total market value of assets 232.0 194.1 146.8 The following amounts at 31 December were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17: 2004 2003 m m Total market value of assets 232.0 194.1 Present value of scheme liabilities 360.2 298.9 Deficit in the schemes 128.2 104.8 Related deferred tax asset 38.5 31.4 Net pension liability 89.7 73.4 This liability has been assessed at a time when equity markets are at a relatively low valuation compared to recent years.
