NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 SEGMENTAL ANALYSES Analyses by geographical area and product segment of net revenues, operating profit and capital employed are set out below.
The figures for each geographical area show the net revenues and profit made by, and the net operating assets owned by, companies located in that area.

c Share-based remuneration The following unaudited disclosures are provided voluntarily in accordance with IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, to show the charge to the Groups profit and loss account in respect of share awards if the standard was adopted in these financial statements.
The Group has used the Black-Scholes pricing model to calculate the fair value of one award on the date of the grant of the award.
Under IFRS 2, the cost attributable to Restricted Stock is based on the fair value at grant, rather than intrinsic value at grant under UK GAAP.
The appropriate adjustments are also included in the disclosures below.
In 2005, the Group plans to adopt the optional transitional arrangement permitted by IFRS 1 which allows companies previously disclosing the fair value charge to adopt IFRS 2 fully retrospectively to all options granted but not fully vested by the reporting date.
Accordingly all such share awards are included in the disclosure below.
Other Share Awards being SAYE and similar schemes are offered to all staff within the relevant geographical area.
Contractual Life: Executive Share Awards have a contractual life of ten years but vest according to EPS growth criteria over a three year period.
Accordingly, the cost is spread over the three years of the performance period.
Other share awards have contractual lives of either three, five or seven years.
Performance criteria: Executive Share Awards are subject to performance criteria based on compound average annual growth CAAG rates in earnings per share over the performance period.
Other Share Awards are generally not subject to any criteria other than the employees continued employment.
Executive Share Awards included in the above table vest as follows: CAAG of 6%: 40% of awards vest: 7% CAAG: 60%: 8% CAAG: 80%: 9% CAAG: 100%.
Profit and loss account charge: the profit and loss account charge for 2004 may not exactly equal one third of the total fair value included in the table above due to adjustments for in year lapses or award revisions.
Other Share Awards include all SAYE schemes and a number of Executive Share Ownership Policy Plan SOPP awards.
Individual tranches of these awards are not material for detailed disclosure so have been aggregated in the table above.
Restricted Stock costs actually charged to the profit and loss account in 2004, under UITF 17, are 21.8m.
d Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes around the world which are principally of the funded type.
The Groups two most significant defined benefit schemes are both funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
The principal data for these schemes are as follows: UK US Date of last actuarial review 5 April 2004 1 January 2004 Valuation method used Projected unit Projected unit Amortisation method used Straight line Straight line Number of years over which surplus deficit is spread 12 11 Market value of scheme assets 540m 104m Assumptions: Annual rate of return on investments discount rate 6.5% 6.0% Annual earnings increases 4.8% 5.0% Annual pensions increases 2.8% n a Annual rate of inflation 2.8% 4.0% Level of funding 109% 90% Reckitt Benckiser Annual Report 2004 43 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 4 EMPLOYEES CONTINUED The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account, calculated in accordance with the advice of professionally qualified independent actuaries, is made up as follows: UK US 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Regular cost 6 6 3 3 Variations from regular cost 2 4 2 Net pension cost 4 2 1 3 Debtors due after more than one year includes a prepayment of 51m 2003 55m in respect of the excess funding of the UK scheme, 10m 2003 provision 3m in respect of excess funding of the US scheme and 8m 2003 8m in respect of other schemes.

Surpluses and deficits are spread over the average remaining service lives of the current employees.
e Post-retirement benefits other than pensions Certain retired employees and dependants in the UK and the US are eligible to receive medical and prescription benefits paid for by the Group and provision for this is included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
In the UK, the Group pays the annual subscriptions to a private health plan for certain senior personnel and their dependants after retirement.
There will be no further additions to the number of current employees eligible for post-retirement health benefits.
The amounts involved in the UK scheme are not material.
In the major US scheme, salaried participants become eligible for retiree healthcare benefits after they reach a combined age and years of service rendered after age 40 figure of 70, although the age must be a minimum of 55.
The cost of this scheme is accrued over the full service life of the employees.
