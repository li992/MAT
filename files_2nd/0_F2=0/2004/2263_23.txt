Capital employed comprises the Groups share of the net assets of joint ventures or associates.
The decrease in capital employed of joint ventures in 2004 is principally due to the acquisition of an additional 30 per cent ownership interest in the Cantarell joint venture see note 28a.
The increase in joint ventures in 2003 is principally due to the formation of the Japan Air Gases business in January 2003.
Prior to that all of BOCs turnover in Japan was reported by subsidiary companies.

Tax continued d Factors that may affect future tax charges The total charge in future periods will be affected by any changes to the corporation tax rates in force in the countries in which the Group operates.
The current tax charges will also be affected by changes in the excess of tax depreciation over book depreciation and the use of tax credits.
e Unused tax credits On a consolidated basis, the Group has net operating loss carryforwards of 57.0 million.
If not offset against taxable income, these losses will expire as follows: Net operating loss Year million 2005 0.9 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter, or no expiry date 56.1 For US Federal tax purposes, the Group has investment tax credits and general business tax credits to carry forward of approximately 10.3 million, which are available to reduce income taxes otherwise payable.
These do not expire until 2006 or thereafter.
In addition, the Group has alternative minimum tax credits for US Federal income tax purposes of approximately 22.7 million which can be carried forward to reduce regular tax liabilities of future years.
There is no expiration date on these credits.
Investment tax credits are accounted for by the flow-through method whereby they reduce income taxes currently payable and the provision for income taxes in the period in which the assets giving rise to such credits are placed in service.
Deferred tax assets, subject to the need for a valuation allowance, are recognised to the extent that the investment tax credits are not currently utilised.
Directors Directors remuneration and interests are given in the report on remuneration on pages 64 to 75.

Options and incentive schemes a Policy Executive options that are granted at the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant do not attract a compensation expense under UK GAAP.
For those executive options, including the Long-Term Incentive Plan, that are granted at a discount to the market price of the companys shares at the time of the grant, the compensation expense is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the option.
The Group takes advantage of the exemption granted under UITF17 revised 2003, Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recorded for employee schemes that are granted at a discount.
b Summary of movements BOC operates share option schemes for both executives and employees.
The features of these are given in the report on remuneration on pages 65 and 66 and the employees report on page 24.
The long-term incentive and executive share award plans were granted at an option price of nil.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The long-term incentive plan was granted at an option price of nil.
94 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements 8.
Pensions and other retirement benefits a UK GAAP Group The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The larger schemes are self-administered and the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
Contributions to funded defined benefit schemes are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
For the two largest schemes, in the UK and US, the dates of the latest actuarial reviews are 31 March 2002 and 1 January 2003 respectively.
In South Africa, under the Pension Funds Second Amendment Act 2001, surpluses in pension funds have to be used in a manner specified in Regulations to the Act to improve current and former members benefits before the employer can obtain any benefit from the surpluses.
Consequently, it is considered unlikely that the company will obtain any benefit from the surpluses in the South African schemes.
Therefore, in accordance with FRS17, the surpluses at 30 September 2004 have been written off in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In Europe, company contributions to the main scheme in respect of current service are currently payable at a rate of 13.8 per cent of payroll.
In the year ended 30 September 2004 the company made additional contributions of 30 million to this scheme in order to reduce the funding valuation deficit.
For the year to 30 September 2005, it is expected that additional contributions of 31 million will be made to this scheme, subject to review following the next triennial funding valuation at 31 March 2005.
In the Americas, company contributions to the main pension plan remain suspended as the plan continues to be in surplus.
In Africa, company contributions were payable at rates ranging from 14 per cent to 21 per cent and are expected to remain at that level for the year to 30 September 2005.
In Asia Pacific, company contributions to the main scheme were payable at rates ranging from 11 per cent to 17 per cent and are expected to remain at that level for the year to 30 September 2005.
Some of the defined benefit schemes, including the UK scheme, are closed to new members.
It is therefore expected that under the projected unit method prescribed by FRS17 the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The most recent actuarial funding valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries, in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 30 September 2004 for the purposes of FRS17.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 30 September 2004.

In accordance with the standard, the company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution plan.
This is because the underlying assets and liabilities of the defined benefit schemes cover a number of the Groups UK undertakings and cannot readily be split between each undertaking on a consistent and reliable basis.
The pension cost recognised in the companys accounts is the total of company contributions payable to Group UK pension schemes in the year.
The assets of all Group UK pension schemes are held independently of the Groups finances.
The largest schemes are self-administered.
c US GAAP For the purposes of US GAAP, the pension costs of the largest schemes have been reclassified in the following tables in accordance with the requirement of SFAS132.
The changes in projected benefit obligation, plan assets and details of the funded status of these retirement plans, together with the changes in the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations of the Groups US business, are given below.
The measurement date for UK and US pension plans is 30 June and the measurement date for the Australian and South African plans is 30 September.
The difference between the UK and US GAAP information disclosed in note 8a and c is included in note 30.
Investment strategy for the schemes is generally set by their respective trustee or fiduciary, after taking advice from their investment advisers, and in consultation with the company.
The strategy reflects the funding position of the schemes, and a careful assessment of the risks inherent over the long term in various asset classes.
The assets of the schemes are diversified by asset class, by investment manager and by geography, in order to reduce risk.
At 30 June 2004 the measurement date for SFAS132 reporting, the target asset allocation and actual asset allocation of the main UK scheme was: 2004 2003 Target Actual Actual Equity securities 70.0% 71.9% 73.0% Debt securities 20.0% 19.2% 20.5% Real estate 10.0% 7.8% 5.0% Cash 0.0% 1.1% 1.5% In the US, the fiduciary invests in short-term bonds to broadly cash match the liabilities that are expected to fall due within three years.
The balance of the plans assets are currently invested in equities.
Following this policy, the actual asset allocations of the plan at 30 June 2004 was as follows: 2004 2003 Equity securities 77.5% 87.4% Debt securities 22.5% 12.6% The company establishes the long-term expected rate of return on the schemes assets by developing a long-term rate of return assumption for each asset class, taking into account such factors as the market yield on bond investments of appropriate duration, and the expected risk premium for other asset classes, based on long-term historical trends.
A single, long-term return assumption is then calculated as a weighted average return, based on the expected returns for each asset class.

Financial instruments a Interest rate, currency and counterparty exposure The Groups approach to managing currency and interest rate risk and its use of swaps in that process is described on page 50 in the financial review under the heading management of financial risks.
Interest rate swaps At 30 September 2004, the Group had entered into five interest rate swap agreements 2003: six with its main relationship banks with notional principal amounts of 285.3 million 2003: 417.6 million.
The swaps underlying currencies are sterling, US dollars and Japanese yen.

For those bearing either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest an assessment of the interest rate at which the Group could make the same loan under current conditions has been made.
Unless this differs significantly from the fixed rate it is also deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
Where this does differ significantly, the fair value is based on the discounted value of future cash flows.
For equity instruments listed on a recognised stock exchange the fair value is the quoted market price.
For other equity instruments it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
The fair value is the quoted market price.
Where no quoted market price exists, it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
As all bear either no interest or a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a floating rate of interest it is deemed that the carrying amount approximates to the fair value.
For those bearing a fixed rate of interest the fair value is either the quoted market price where a liquid market exists or has been calculated using well established pricing models.
The carrying amount is deemed to approximate to the fair value.
The fair value is based on market valuations at the balance sheet date.
The fair value is based on market prices and exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
Includes foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements.
ii Hedges As explained on page 50 of the financial review under the heading management of financial risks, the Groups policies are to use forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge transactional currency exposures principally arising through anticipated sales and purchase transactions and swap agreements to manage interest rate risks and hedge structural currency exposures.
Currency swaps are only held to change the currency of the Groups borrowings to match better its net investments in its overseas subsidiaries.
In accordance with the Groups accounting policies, the assets and liabilities arising from these swap agreements are translated into sterling at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange gains or losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match the exchange gains or losses on the net investments in the overseas subsidiaries.

After taking account of the hedging transactions, there was no significant net profit and loss account exposure to currency gains and losses arising from monetary assets and liabilities at 30 September 2004. d Financial instruments i Financial assets The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial assets excluding short-term debtors at 30 September 2004 is shown below.

The floating rate financial assets, which principally comprise cash and deposits, current asset investments and loans to joint ventures and associates, carry interest based on different benchmark rates depending on the currency of the balance.
The principal benchmark rates for floating rate financial assets are LIBOR for sterling balances, US LIBOR for US dollar balances, Australian bank bill rate for Australian dollar balances, South African prime rate for South African rand balances and Japanese yen LIBOR for Japanese yen balances.

The maturity profile of borrowings is set out in note 20 b.
Floating rate financial liabilities other than borrowings are mainly employee incentive provisions.
These are expected to be utilised over the period to 2011 depending on the future choices of the relevant employees.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid principally relate to creditors due after more than one year.
The majority of the amount relates to deposits for cylinder rentals.
It is not anticipated that this balance will reduce significantly in the short to medium term.
The remaining balances falling due after more than one year are expected to be paid or utilised by 2009.

116 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements 22.
Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Incentive and other employee provisions include long-term share incentive units and deferred compensation plans.
Note 7 contains further details of the long-term share incentive units.
Provision for uninsured losses covers third party liabilities or claims.
Due to the time frame that is often involved in such claims, a significant part of this provision is subject to actuarial valuation.
Where this is not appropriate, other external assessments are used.
Environmental provisions have been set aside to cover the costs of remediation for a number of hazardous waste sites.
The costs are expected to be incurred between 2005 and 2030.
Due to the period over which this expenditure is likely to be incurred, the provision has been discounted at a rate of four per cent.
The effect of discounting is 8 million.
Management expects that payments will be approximately 4 million each year for the next five years and 10 million in total thereafter.
Other provisions are principally for warranty and legal costs.
Further information on deferred tax is disclosed in note 4.

The outcome of litigation to which Group companies are party cannot be readily foreseen, but the directors believe that such litigation should be disposed of without material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or profitability.
Welding fumes litigation A US subsidiary of the Group, The BOC Group, Inc. has been named in US lawsuits alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes.
Certain of these cases have been either filed in, or transferred for pre-trial purposes to, the federal district court in the Northern District of Ohio, where a multi-district litigation MDL proceeding has been commenced.
The MDL proceeding is a vehicle for coordinating pre-trial proceedings in cases pending in different federal district courts in the US.
It is currently contemplated that the MDL court will try three cases during the MDL proceeding.
The first such case is currently scheduled for mid 2005.
In addition to the cases in federal court, The BOC Group, Inc. is a defendant in a number of similar cases pending in state courts.
These cases are in different stages of procedural development, and certain cases are scheduled for trial from time to time.
From the time Airco was purchased in 1978 until 2003 The BOC Group, Inc. had never had an adverse jury verdict returned against it in a case alleging injury from exposure to welding fumes.
On 28 October 2003, a jury in Madison County, Illinois, rendered a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc. and two co-defendants.
The jury awarded US$1 million to Mr Elam, a former labourer who asserted that his idiopathic Parkinsons disease was attributable to his exposure to welding fumes over a period of years.
BOC believes that the verdict is inconsistent with the decisions rendered by juries in previous cases, is not supported by the existing scientific evidence and is pursuing an appeal in the Illinois court system.
On 12 May 2004 a jury in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, returned a verdict against The BOC Group, Inc. and one co-defendant.
The jury awarded Mr Yencho, who alleged that his injury was caused by exposure to asbestos welding rods, US$525,000, to be divided between the defendants.
BOC believes that the jury verdict is inconsistent with the evidence introduced at trial and believes that there are strong grounds for a successful post-trial motion and, if necessary, an appeal.
The BOC Group, Inc. believes that it has strong defences to the claims asserted in these various proceedings related to alleged injury from exposure to welding fumes and intends to defend vigorously such claims.
Based on its experience to date, together with its current assessment of the merits of the claims being asserted and applicable insurance, BOC believes that continued defence and resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or profitability and no provision has been made.
The welding electrodes business was sold in 1986 and the sale of the US packaged gas business, including the operations involved in distributing packaged gases and welding equipment, was completed in July 2004.
Fluorogas litigation In February 2003, the company was notified that a jury verdict in the US District Court for the Western District of Texas the District Court was obtained for US$132 million against Fluorogas Limited, The BOC Group, Inc. and The BOC Group plc.
The verdict arose primarily out of an alleged breach of a memorandum of understanding by Fluorogas Limited before it was acquired by The BOC Group plc in September 2001.
In March 2003, the court also awarded interest and costs against the defendants, making them jointly and severally liable for a total of US$174 million.
A bond for the full amount was posted with the District Court as part of the normal appeals process.
In August 2004, the appellate court reversed the entire judgement against the BOC entities and all but US$170,000 in reliance damages against Fluorogas Limited.
In addition, the appellate court remanded for reconsideration by the District Court an award of attorneys fees on the US$170,000 recovery.
Fluorogas Limited was placed in administration under the Insolvency Act of 1986 pursuant to an order of an English Court.
It is expected to remain in administration until the conclusion of the remand proceedings in the District Court.
ERISA litigation An action was filed in the US District Court for the Southern District of Illinois the District Court against The BOC Group Cash Balance Retirement Plan the Plan.
The plaintiffs brought this action on behalf of themselves and all others similarly affected, alleging that the Plan improperly calculated lump sum distributions from the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.
The settlement was approved by the District Court at a fairness hearing on 12 March 2004.

In September 2004, BOC acquired an additional 30 per cent ownership interest in Compania fide Nitrogeno fide Cantarell CNC from Duke Energy, increasing BOCs overall stake in CNC to 65 per cent.
This followed a decision by Duke Energy that a sale of their interest was more in line with their long-term strategy.
BOC continues to account for CNC as a joint venture as, in accordance with UK GAAP FRS9 Associates and joint ventures, it is a company jointly controlled by BOC and another party.
On 30 July 2004 BOC completed the sale of its US packaged gas business to Airgas Inc.
In February 2004 BOC disposed of its 50 per cent holding in Birlesik Oksijen Sanayi Turkey.
These disposals affected the ISP business segment.

The net effect of the transaction was to exchange 55 per cent of the OSK business for a 45 per cent equity share in Japan Air Gases Ltd.
This transaction was accounted for in accordance with UK GAAP UITF31 Exchange of businesses or other non-monetary assets for an interest in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate.

US accounting information a Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles and other US accounting information The financial statements of The BOC Group plc are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from accounting principles generally accepted in the US US GAAP.
Set out below is a summary of the more significant adjustments which would be required if US GAAP had been applied, together with reconciliations of net profit, other comprehensive income and shareholders funds from a UK GAAP to a US GAAP basis.
Also presented on a US GAAP basis are a movement in shareholders funds, a consolidated cash flow statement, information on earnings per share, information on stock based compensation and details of recently issued US accounting pronouncements.
Goodwill and other intangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1998 accounted for under the purchase method has been eliminated against shareholders funds.
Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal or closure of a business, any goodwill previously taken directly to shareholders funds is then charged against income.
The Group adopted FRS10 in 1999, which requires goodwill on subsequent acquisitions to be capitalised and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP, following the adoption of SFAS142 Goodwill and other Intangible Assets, which was effective for the Group from 1 October 2002, goodwill continues to be capitalised, although amortisation is no longer charged to the income statement.
Instead, an annual impairment test is carried out, with any identified impairment loss recorded in the income statement.
Other intangible assets with a finite life continue to be amortised under both UK and US GAAP.
UK GAAP is highly prescriptive with regard to the recognition of intangible assets, although US GAAP rules result in the recognition of a greater amount of intangible assets.
Therefore, differences arise in the classification of some intangible assets and goodwill between UK and US GAAP.
Amortisation that has been charged against goodwill under UK GAAP is added back in the reconciliation to net income on a US GAAP basis.
The average life of other intangible assets is ten years and the annual amortisation charge under US GAAP is expected to be approximately 1 million.
Impairment of goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first financial year following an acquisition, and also when an indicator of impairment exists.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill with the higher of the net realisable value and the value in use.
Under US GAAP, goodwill impairment reviews are also conducted when an indicator of impairment exists, in addition to an annual goodwill impairment test, as required by SFAS142.
The impairment is measured by comparing the carrying value of a reporting unit to its fair value.
Where the carrying value is greater than the fair value, the impairment loss is based on the excess of the carrying value of goodwill in the reporting unit over the implied fair value of the goodwill.
Profit or loss on the partial disposal of Group companies Under UK GAAP UITF 31, gains on the partial disposal of Group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, such gains and losses are recorded in the income statement.
Deferred tax The Group adopted FRS19 Deferred tax in 2002 for UK GAAP purposes.
This requires that full provision for deferred tax is recognised in the financial statements.
The adoption of FRS19 has eliminated most of the differences that previously existed between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the accounting for deferred tax.
As a result, the tax adjustment now primarily relates to the deferred tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
124 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements 30.
US accounting information continued Revaluation of fixed assets UK GAAP allowed for the periodic revaluation of land and buildings with depreciation then being calculated on the revalued amount.
Any surplus or deficit to the extent that the revaluation reserve was in surplus on the revaluation was then taken directly to shareholdersfunds.
With the Groups adoption of FRS15 in 2000, the Group no longer revalues fixed assets.
Under US GAAP, revaluations of fixed assets are not permitted and, as a result, the reconciliation restates fixed assets to historical cost.
The depreciation charge and any write downs of previously revalued assets are adjusted accordingly.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets Under UK GAAP, a tangible fixed asset is reviewed for impairment if an indication exists that the asset may be impaired.
If necessary, an impairment loss is recorded.
A value in use calculation is carried out, based on discounted pre-tax future cash flows from the asset or income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Under US GAAP, a preliminary review of the tangible fixed asset is carried out using undiscounted future cash flows.
If the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value, an impairment loss is required.
The impairment loss will be calculated using discounted future cash flows, or the assets market value.
Under US GAAP, the reversal of previously recognised impairment losses is not permitted.
Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, when a decision has been taken to restructure, supported by a detailed formal plan and the creation of a valid expectation in those affected that the restructuring will take place, the necessary provisions are made for impairment of asset values together with severance and other costs.
Under US GAAP SFAS146, the requirements for charging restructuring costs to income are more prescriptive and all significant actions arising from the restructuring plan and their completion dates must be identified by the balance sheet date.
Pensions For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the pension asset or liability in the balance sheet represents the difference between the market value of pension scheme assets at the balance sheet date and the present value of pension scheme liabilities at that date, net of deferred tax.
Under US GAAP SFAS87, plan assets are valued by reference to market-related value at the date of the financial statements.
Liabilities are assessed using the rate of return obtainable on fixed or inflation-linked bonds.
FRS17 requires that past service costs are recognised in full in the period in which they become vested.
SFAS87 requires past service costs to be amortised over the remaining service lives of the employees to whom the amendments relate.
There is a significant difference in the treatment of actuarial gains and losses arising during the accounting period.
UK GAAP recognises the actuarial gains and losses in full in the year in which they arise in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, the actuarial gains and losses which exceed ten per cent of the value of the assets or liabilities at the start of the accounting period are amortised over the remaining service lives of scheme members.
Where an additional minimum liability exists under US GAAP, ie where the amount provided for any scheme does not cover the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation for that scheme, this must be recognised in the balance sheet under SFAS87.
The adjustment resulting from the recognition of an additional minimum liability is reported as an intangible asset to the extent of the unrecognised prior service cost, after eliminating amounts previously shown as a prepaid benefit cost.
Any excess above these amounts is reported in comprehensive income.
Post retirement medical costs For UK GAAP reporting FRS17 Retirement benefits, the post retirement medical liability is discounted using the bond yield on suitable high quality corporate bonds, and disclosed net of related deferred tax.
For US GAAP SFAS106, the liabilities are assessed and discounted using the rates of return obtainable on high quality fixed income investments.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise largely from the treatment of actuarial gains and losses.
Securities investments Under UK GAAP, current asset investments of all types are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Fixed asset investments are stated at cost, or alternatively, at market value or at directors valuation.
Under US GAAP, securities which are determined to be available-for-sale are stated at fair value and any unrealised gains or losses included as a separate component of shareholders funds.
The deferred tax consequences of unrealised gains or losses are also charged or credited to shareholders funds.
Contingent consideration Under UK GAAP, contingent consideration is provided for as a liability when the likelihood of payment is considered to be probable.
Under US GAAP, contingent consideration is not recognised until the liability is determined beyond reasonable doubt.
The elimination of contingent consideration for US GAAP purposes also impacts on the value of goodwill arising on acquisitions, therefore there is no net impact on shareholders funds.
Financial instruments The Group enters into a number of currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge its exposure to currency and interest rate risks.
Under UK GAAP, such instruments are shown at their carrying value.
Under US GAAP, these instruments are marked to market and any change in value is recognised in either the income statement or through comprehensive income in accordance with SFAS133 depending on whether a derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if it is, the type of hedge transaction.
Accounting for swaps Under UK GAAP, gains or losses on closing out interest rate swap contracts taken to hedge the Groups fixed floating interest rate position can be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the remaining hedge period.
125 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements 30.
US accounting information continued Share of results and net assets of joint ventures and associates The Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates as calculated under UK GAAP is shown within fixed asset investments.
For the purposes of the reconciliations set out below, the Groups share of the results and net assets of its joint ventures and associates has been adjusted to recognise a difference in the method of reporting profits under US GAAP.
Sale and leaseback transactions Under UK GAAP, any profit or loss on the sale and operating leaseback of fixed assets can generally be taken to profit immediately.
US GAAP requires any gain or loss to be deferred over the contract lease period.
Comprehensive income Under US GAAP, SFAS130 establishes requirements for the reporting of comprehensive income and its components revenue, expenses, gains and losses in a full set of general purpose financial statements.
Components of comprehensive income for the Group determined on a UK GAAP basis include profit for the financial year, pension actuarial gains and losses, and foreign currency translation gains and losses.
Information regarding the Groups foreign currency translation gains and losses is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under UK GAAP on page 81. b Income statement in US GAAP format The Group profit and loss account on page 78 complies with UK GAAP.
For SEC reporting purposes this presentation would be considered non GAAP and therefore disclosed below is the income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X.
The financial numbers disclosed within the income statement are prepared under UK GAAP.

US accounting information continued f Consolidated cash flow statement The Group cash flow statement on page 80 has been prepared in accordance with UK accounting standard FRS1, the objectives and principles of which are similar to those set out in US accounting principle SFAS95, Statement of Cash Flows.
The principal differences between the standards relate to classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under FRS1, cash flows are presented separately for: a operating activities: b dividends from joint ventures and associates: c returns on investments and servicing of finance: d tax paid: e capital expenditure and financial investment: f acquisitions and disposals: g equity dividends paid: h management of liquid resources: and i financing.
Under SFAS95, however, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: a operating activities: b investing activities: and c financing activities.
Dividends from joint ventures and associates, cash flows from returns on investments and servicing of finance excluding dividends paid to minorities and tax paid under FRS1 would be included in operating activities under SFAS95: capital expenditure and acquisitions and disposals would be included in investing activities under SFAS95: equity dividends would be included as a financing activity under SFAS95.
Under FRS1, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with any qualifying financial institution, less overdrafts from any qualifying financial institution repayable on demand.
Under SFAS95, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits but also includes cash equivalents which are short-term, highly liquid investments.
Generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less come within this definition.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows under SFAS95.
2004 2003 2002 million million million Net cash provided by operating activities 673.5 562.4 620.2 Net cash used by investing activities 45.2 389.2 550.6 Net cash used by financing activities 413.0 292.7 112.1 Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 215.3 119.5 42.5 Cash and cash equivalents at 1 October 76.4 181.9 259.0 Exchange and other movements 2.0 14.0 34.6 Cash and cash equivalents at 30 September 289.7 76.4 181.9 g Stock-based compensation For US reporting purposes the company applies APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and related interpretations, in accounting for its share option plans.
By applying this statement the employee share schemes are deemed non-compensatory and therefore do not result in an expense for financial reporting purposes.
With the exception of the Long-Term Incentive Plan, grants of share options under executive schemes are at the market price of the companys shares at the time of grant.
The schemes are deemed compensatory and a charge is only recognised when certain performance conditions are met.
If compensation cost for the Groups share option plans had been determined based on the fair value at the grant dates for awards under those plans consistent with the method of SFAS123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, the Groups net income under US GAAP would have been: 2004 2003 2002 million million million Reported net income 297.7 264.3 255.4 Add stock compensation expense recognised in accordance with APB25 net of related tax 2.5 Deduct stock compensation expense determined in accordance with SFAS123 net of related tax 5.7 7.1 6.9 Pro forma net income 292.0 257.2 251.0 2004 2003 2002 pence pence pence Earnings per share: Basic as reported 60.4 53.7 52.1 Basic pro forma 59.2 52.2 51.2 Diluted as reported 60.3 53.6 51.9 Diluted pro forma 59.1 52.2 51.0 The Black-Scholes model was used to measure the compensation expense under SFAS123.
The assumptions used for grants in 2004 included a dividend yield of 4.5 per cent 2003: 4.5 per cent, 2002: 4.0 per cent, expected share price volatility of 29.5 per cent 2003: 30.6 per cent, 2002: 31.0 per cent, a weighted average expected life of 4.9 years 2003: 5.0 years, 2002: 5.0 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 per cent 2003: 4.0 per cent, 2002: 4.9 per cent.
The weighted average interest rate is based on UK Gilts on the date of grant with a maturity similar to the related options.
128 The BOC Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements 30.
US accounting information continued h Goodwill For US reporting purposes the company applies SFAS142 in accounting for goodwill.
The changes in the carrying value of goodwill for the year ended 30 September 2004 are as follows: Industrial Process and Special BOC Afrox Gas Solutions Products Edwards hospitals Gist Corporate Total million million million million million million million Balance at 1 October 59.5 82.7 121.0 11.6 0.7 2.7 278.2 Acquired during year 0.6 3.3 3.9 Adjustments related to prior year acquisitions 2.9 0.4 2.5 Impairments in year 2.5 2.5 Exchange adjustment 3.7 4.2 6.6 0.3 0.2 15.0 Balance at 30 September 55.8 79.1 109.0 15.0 0.7 2.5 262.1 i Recently issued accounting pronouncements implemented in the year SFAS132 revised Employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits SFAS132 revised was issued in December 2003 and is effective for years ending after 15 June 2004.
This statement revises employersdisclosures about pension plans and other post retirement benefit plans.
It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS87, SFAS88 and SFAS106 and retains the disclosure requirements contained in SFAS132.
It requires additional disclosures about the types of plan assets, investment strategy, plan obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit post retirement plans.
These additional disclosure requirements are presented within note 8c to the financial statements.
FIN46 revised Consolidation of variable interest entities FIN46 revised was issued in December 2003.
Application of this interpretation is required for all public entities that have interests in variable interest entities for periods ending after 15 December 2003.
Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after 15 March 2004.
This interpretation requires the primary beneficiary to consolidate a variable interest entity if it holds a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses if they occur, receive a majority of the entitys residual returns if they occur, or both.
The effect of FIN46 revised has led to the Groups interest in Compania fide Nitrogeno fide Cantarell being accounted for as a subsidiary under US GAAP.
This resulted in additional total assets of 456.9 million, total liabilities of 494.4 million and minority interests of 13.1 million.
There is no material impact on the income statement.
The 29.7 million adjustment in respect of the variable interest entity relates to the 13.1 million minority interests and other specific US GAAP adjustments within the entity.
EITF018 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease In May 2003, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 018.
Issue 018 provides guidance for determining whether an arrangement contains a lease that is within the scope of SFAS13 Accounting for Leases.
If it is determined that a lease exists, the lease and non-lease components of a combined sales arrangement must be accounted for separately.
Issue 018 is effective prospectively for arrangements initiated, modified, or acquired after 1 July 2003.
Management has evaluated the impact of EITF Issue 018 on its on-site supply agreements and has concluded that it does not have a material impact on the Groups results or financial position.
j Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet implemented EITF041 Accounting for Pre-existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination EITF041 applies when two parties that have a pre-existing contractual relationship enter into a business combination.
Specifically, the issue is whether a consummation of a business combination between two parties that have a pre-existing contractual relationship should be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a pre-existing contractual relationship exists, thus requiring accounting separate from the business combination.
If separate accounting is required, then the measurement of the settlement amount will be decided.
Finally, if it is determined that assets of the acquired entity that are related to a pre-existing contractual relationship with the acquiring entity should be recognised as part of the business combination, whether the acquiring entity should recognise those assets as intangible assets apart from goodwill will be decided.
k Other information Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Comparative information The application of UITF37 Purchases and sales of own shares and UITF38 Accounting for ESOP trusts has not had any impact on the Group profit and loss account.
