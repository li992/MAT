124 BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles The United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles are divided into the following sections: 125 Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles 128 Net income and shareholders equity reconciliation statements 128 Minority interests 129 Accounting for share options 129 Consolidated statements of cash ows 129 Current asset investments 130 Pension costs 132 Income statement in US GAAP format 133 US GAAP developments 125 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 The groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US US GAAP.
i Differences between United Kingdom and United States generally accepted accounting principles The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the groups financial statements.
a Sale and leaseback of properties Under UK GAAP, the sale of BTs property portfolio is treated as a xed asset disposal and the subsequent leaseback is an operating lease.
Under US GAAP, the transaction is regarded as nancing and the land and buildings are recorded on the balance sheet at their net book value, an obligation equivalent to the cash proceeds is recognised and the gain on disposal is deferred until the properties are vacated by BT.
Rental payments made by BT are reversed and replaced by a finance lease interest charge and a depreciation charge.
b Pension costs Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24, with costs being charged against profits over employees working lives.
Under US GAAP, pension costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of US Statements of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS Nos.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP gures arise from the requirement to use different actuarial methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deficits.
c Accounting for redundancies Under UK GAAP, the cost of providing incremental pension benets in respect of workforce reductions is taken into account when determining current and future pension costs, unless the most recent actuarial valuation, combined with the provision for pension costs in the group balance sheet, under UK actuarial conventions, shows a deficit.
In this case, the cost of providing incremental pension benets is included in redundancy charges in the year in which the employees agree to leave the group.
Under US GAAP, the associated costs of providing incremental pension benets are charged against profits in the period in which the termination terms are agreed with the employees.
The fair value of termination benets for employees who are to be retained beyond their minimum contractual retention period is recognised on a straight line basis over the future service period.
d Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, the group does not capitalise interest.
To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in xed assets, and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
This included capitalisation of interest incurred on funding the 3G licences up to the date of the mmO demerger.
The amount of interest capitalised is determined by reference to the 2 average interest rates on outstanding borrowings.
At 31 March 2004 under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of 358 million 2003 461 million with regard to the company and its subsidiary companies was subject to depreciation generally over periods of 3 to 25 years.
e Goodwill Under UK GAAP, in respect of acquisitions completed prior to 1 April 1998, the group wrote off goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures on acquisition against retained earnings.
The goodwill is reected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain or loss on divestment.
All unamortised and pre-April 1998 goodwill will be brought back to the profit and loss account on disposal.
Following the implementation of UK Financial Reporting Standard No.
10 FRS 10, goodwill arising on acquisitions completed after 1 April 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
Under US GAAP up to 31 March 2002, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures was capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful life.
With effect from 1 April 2002 BT has adopted SFAS No.
142, and goodwill is no longer amortised but tested annually for impairment.
In connection with the adoption of SFAS No.
142 transitional and annual impairment reviews were performed.
There was no transitional impairment charge recorded.
As a result of the annual impairment review, no goodwill impairment charge was recognised in the year ended 31 March 2004 2003 54 million.
Goodwill of 12 million 2003 20 million amortised under UK GAAP is written back through the income statement.
126 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Had the cessation of goodwill amortisation requirement of SFAS No.
142 been applied in prior periods, results of operations would have been as follows: 2003 2002 m m Net income loss as adjusted for US GAAP 4,134 732 Add back: goodwill amortisation 34 Adjusted net income loss 4,134 698 Adjusted basic earnings per American Depositary Share 4.80 0.84 Adjusted diluted earnings per American Depositary Share 4.80 0.84 f Mobile cellular telephone licences, software and other intangible assets Certain intangible xed assets recognised under US GAAP purchase accounting requirements are subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP these separately identied intangible assets are valued and amortised over their useful lives of 20 years.
g Financial instruments Under UK GAAP, investments are held on the balance sheet at historical cost, and own shares held in trust for share schemes are recorded in xed asset investments.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedges are not recognised until the exposure being hedged is recognised.
Under US GAAP, trading securities and available-forsale securities are carried at market value with appropriate valuation adjustments recorded in profit and loss and shareholders equity, respectively.
Certain derivative financial instruments which qualify for hedge accounting under UK GAAP do not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting due to the extensive documentation requirements.
These financial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried at market value with valuation adjustments recorded in the profit and loss account.
The reassessment and purchase of derivatives in the year ended 31 March 2004 gave rise to an adjustment reducing net income by 133 million net of tax 2003 increase 610 million.
The net unrealised holding gain on equity investments held as available-for-sale securities for the year ended 31 March 2004 was 5 million 2003 22 million, 2002 271 million.
SFAS 133 became effective for BT on 1 April 2001 and the unamortised transitional adjustment of 9 million net of tax remains in shareholders equity at 31 March 2004. h Deferred gain Under UK GAAP, assets contributed to a joint venture by the groups partners are measured at their net replacement cost.
Any difference between the groups share of the joint ventures resulting net assets and the net book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture, including certain accrued start up costs, is immediately reected by adjusting the groups investment in the joint venture and recording a deferred difference in shareholders equity.
Under US GAAP, the assets contributed by all joint venture partners are carried at their historical net book value and any difference between the groups share of the joint ventures resulting net assets and the net book value of assets contributed by the group to the joint venture is amortised over the life of the items giving rise to the difference.
i Employee share plans Certain share options have been granted under BT save-as-you-earn plans at a 20% discount.
Under UK GAAP, the share issues are recorded at their discounted price when the options are exercised.
Under US GAAP, a plan is considered compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15%.
Compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
Under UK GAAP, shares held by employee share ownership trusts are recorded as xed asset investments at cost less amounts written off.
Under US GAAP, those shares not fully vested are regarded as treasury stock and recorded at cost as a deduction from shareholders equity.
j Investments in associates Under UK GAAP, the economic interest in the associates operating profits before minority interest is reported as part of the total operating profit.
For those associates in which a minority interest is recognised in their respective statements of profit and loss, such minority interest is reported as minority interest in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the minority interest in the associates is reclassied from minority interest and reported within the share of results of associates.
127 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 k Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arose as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Under US GAAP, deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis.
Future tax benets are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than not.
As a result of changes in circumstances, previously recognised deferred tax liabilities were released in the 2003 financial year.
At 31 March 2004 total deferred tax liabilities were 2,780 million primarily in respect of accelerated capital allowances and total deferred tax assets were 2,240 million, primarily in respect of pension obligations.
l Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared in the case of interim or any special dividends or proposed by the board of directors to the shareholders in the case of final dividends.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
m Impairment Under UK GAAP, if there is an indication of impairment the assets should be tested for impairment and, if necessary written down to the value in use, calculated based on discounted future pre-tax cash ows related to the asset or the income generating unit to which the asset belongs.
US GAAP requires that an entity assess whether impairment has occurred based on the undiscounted future cash ows.
An impairment loss exists if the sum of these cash ows is less than the carrying amount of the asset.
The impairment loss recognised in the income statement is based on the assets fair value, being either market value or the sum of discounted future cash ows.
n Discontinued operations Under UK GAAP, the disposal of certain lines of business and joint ventures and associates are shown as discontinued activities.
Under US GAAP, only the disposals of lines of business under SFAS No.
144 would be reported as discontinued operations.
o Disposals of businesses There are timing differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP for recognition of gains on the sale of certain businesses.
Foreign exchange movements taken to reserves under UK GAAP are reported in the income statement under US GAAP.
Historical GAAP differences on disposed businesses are also shown under this line item.
p Property rationalisation provision Under UK GAAP in the 2003 financial year, a provision in connection with the rationalisation of the groups London ofce property portfolio was recorded.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No 146, these costs are not recognised until the group fully exits and therefore ceases to use the affected properties.
q Software Under UK GAAP long-term contracts to design, build and operate software solutions are accounted for under SSAP 9 Stocks and long-term contracts and FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, under which turnover is recognised as earned over the contract period.
Under US GAAP revenue of 77 million under these contracts is deferred in the 2004 financial year under SOP 97-2 Software revenue recognition, which requires vendor specic objective evidence to support the fair value of the separate elements to be delivered.
There was no impact on net income.
128 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 ii Net income and shareholders equity reconciliation statements The following statements summarise the material estimated adjustments, gross of their tax effect, which reconcile net income and shareholders equity from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.
Net income 2004 2003 2002 Years ended 31 March m m m Net income applicable to shareholders under UK GAAP 1,417 2,686 995 Adjustment for: Sale and leaseback of properties 85 114 1,178 Pension costs 428 177 106 Redundancy charges 20 140 Capitalisation of interest, net of related depreciation 23 17 398 Goodwill 12 35 11 Mobile licences, software and other intangible asset capitalisation and amortisation, net 26 32 Financial instruments 82 731 23 Deferred gain 313 Impairment 24 24 147 Employee share plans 8 11 8 Property rationalisation provision 142 147 Disposals of businesses 130 254 Deferred taxation 4 976 1,320 661 4,266 643 Tax effect of US GAAP adjustments 222 132 89 Net income loss as adjusted for US GAAP 883 4,134 732 a Basic earnings loss per American Depositary Share as adjusted for US GAAP 1.02 4.80 0.88 a Diluted earnings loss per American Depositary Share as adjusted for US GAAP 1.02 4.77 0.88 a Each American Depositary Share is equivalent to ten ordinary shares.
In the 2004 and 2003 financial years all the adjustments relate to continuing operations 2002 2,009 million reduction in relation to discontinued operations.
Net income from continuing operations was 883 million 2003 4,134 million, 2002 1,680 million loss.
The adjustments to net income relating to discontinued operations are nil 2003 nil, 2002 282 million.
Shareholders equity 2004 2003 At 31 March m m Shareholders equity under UK GAAP 3,094 2,642 Adjustment for: Sale and leaseback of properties 1,377 1,292 Pension costs 5,714 6,371 Redundancy charges 20 Capitalisation of interest, net of related depreciation 195 225 Goodwill 124 113 Financial instruments 8 86 Impairment 100 124 Property rationalisation provision 5 147 Deferred taxation 59 63 Dividend declared after the financial year end 454 366 3,166 4,023 Tax effect of US GAAP adjustments 1,711 1,765 Shareholders equity as adjusted for US GAAP 1,455 2,258 iii Minority interests Under US GAAP, the income to minority interests would have been unchanged 2003 27 million reduction, 2002 26 million reduction after adjusting for goodwill amortisation and accounting for associates and joint ventures.
Net assets attributable to minority interests would have been unchanged 2003 unchanged after adjusting for financial instruments.
129 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 iv Accounting for share options Under UK GAAP, the company does not recognise compensation expense for the fair value, at the date of grant, of share options granted under the employee share option schemes.
Under US GAAP, the company adopted the disclosure-only provisions in SFAS No.
Accordingly, the company accounts for share options in accordance with APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which no compensation expense is recognised.
Had the group expensed recognised compensation cost for options granted in accordance with SFAS No.
123, the groups pro forma net income loss, basic earnings loss per share and diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP would have been 862 million 2003 4,127 million, 2002 792 million loss, 10.0p 2003 47.9p, 2002 9.5p loss and 9.9p 2003 47.6p, 2002 9.5p loss, respectively.
123 disclosures of the fair value of options granted under employee schemes at date of grant.
v Consolidated statements of cash ows Under UK GAAP, the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are presented in accordance with UK Financial Reporting Standard No.
The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same information as that required under SFAS No.
95, cash and cash equivalents include cash and short-term investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase.
Under FRS 1 cash comprises cash in hand and at bank and overnight deposits, net of bank overdrafts.
Under FRS 1, cash ows are presented for operating activities: returns on investments and servicing of finance: taxation: capital expenditure and financial investments: acquisitions and disposals: dividends paid to the companys shareholders: management of liquid resources and nancing.
95 requires a classication of cash ows as resulting from operating, investing and nancing activities.
Cash ows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid net of that capitalised under US GAAP and taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No.
Cash ows from purchases, sales and maturities of trading securities, while not separately identied under UK GAAP, would be included within operating activities under US GAAP.
Capitalised interest, while not recognised under UK GAAP, is included in investing activities under US GAAP.
Dividends paid are included within nancing activities under US GAAP.
The following statements summarise the statements of cash ows as if they had been presented in accordance with US GAAP, and include the adjustments which reconcile cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP to cash at bank and in hand reported under UK GAAP.
2004 2003 2002 m m m Net cash provided by operating activities 4,632 3,395 1,455 Net cash used provided by investing activities 3,460 1,253 3,049 Net cash used in nancing activities 3,093 2,852 5,611 Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 1,921 1,796 1,107 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 5 13 50 Cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP at beginning of year 2,933 1,124 2,281 Cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP at end of year 1,007 2,933 1,124 Short-term investments with original maturities of less than three months 898 2,842 966 Cash at bank and in hand under UK GAAP at end of year 109 91 158 vi Current asset investments Under US GAAP, investments in debt securities would be classied as either trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity.
Trading investments would be stated at fair values and the unrealised gains and losses would be included in income.
Securities classied as available-for-sale would be stated at fair values, with unrealised gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, reported in shareholders equity.
Debt securities classied as held-tomaturity would be stated at amortised cost.
The following analyses do not include securities with original maturities of less than three months.
130 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 vi Current asset investments continued At 31 March 2004, the group held trading investments as dened by US GAAP with fair values totalling 423 million 2003 935 million.
Held-to-maturity securities at 31 March 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2004 3,629 3,629 Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2003 2,565 2,565 The contractual maturities of the held-to-maturity debt securities at 31 March 2004 were as follows: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Maturing on or before 31 March 2005 2,253 2,253 Maturing after 1 year through 5 years 1,376 1,376 Total at 31 March 2004 3,629 3,629 Available for sale investments at 31 March 2004 and 2003 consisted of the following: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2004 214 214 Commercial paper, medium-term notes and other investments at 31 March 2003 The contractual maturities of the available for sale investments at 31 March 2004 were as follows: Amortised Estimated cost fair value m m Maturing on or before 31 March 2005 214 214 Maturing after 1 year through 5 years Total at 31 March 2004 214 214 vii Pension costs The following position for the main pension scheme is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting rules under SFAS No.
88, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements.
The pension cost determined under SFAS No.
87 was calculated by reference to an expected long-term rate of return on scheme assets of 7.35% 2003 6.9%, 2002 6.5%.
The components of the pension cost for the main pension scheme comprised: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Service cost 388 453 564 Interest cost 1,657 1,707 1,739 Expected return on scheme assets 1,646 1,813 1,863 Amortisation of prior service costs 24 24 24 Amortisation of net obligation at date of limited application of SFAS No.

132 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 vii Pension costs continued Asset allocation The Trustees of the main pension scheme approve the target asset allocation as well as deviation limits.
The objective of the investment activities is to maximise investment return within an acceptable level of risk, taking into consideration the liabilities of the main pension scheme.
Year ended 31 December 2003 Fair value Target bn % % Equities 17.1 65.0 64.75 Fixed interest bonds 3.9 14.8 15.25 Index linked securities 2.1 8.0 8.00 Property 3.2 12.2 12.00 Cash 26.3 100.0 100.00 Year ended 31 December 2002 Fair value Target bn % % Equities 14.8 64.9 64.75 Fixed interest bonds 3.4 15.0 15.25 Index linked securities 1.8 7.7 8.00 Property 3.1 13.9 12.00 Cash 0.4 1.5 22.7 100.0 100.00 The assumption for the expected return in scheme assets is a weighted average based on an assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The expected returns on bonds are based on the gross redemption yields at the start of the year.
Expected returns on equities and property are based on a combination of an estimate of the risk premium above, yields on government bonds and consensus economic forecasts of future returns.
The expected return of 7.27% per annum used for the calculation of pension costs for the year ending 31 March 2005 is consistent with that adopted for FRS 17. viii Income statement in US GAAP format The group profit and loss accounts on pages 78 to 80 comply with UK GAAP and the directors believe they are in the most appropriate format for shareholders to understand the results of our business.
We believe that it is important to show our results before deducting goodwill amortisation and exceptional items because these items predominantly relate to corporate transactions rather than the trading activities of the group.
For SEC reporting purposes this presentation would be considered non GAAP and therefore the group has also prepared the following income statement which meets the SEC reporting format set forth in Item 10 of Regulation S-X.
The financial numbers disclosed in the following income statement are prepared under UK GAAP.
2004 2003 2002 m m m Revenue 18,519 18,727 18,447 Operating expenses: Payroll costs 3,735 3,671 3,698 Depreciation and amortisation 2,936 3,035 5,345 Payments to telecommunication operators 3,963 3,940 4,289 Other operating expenses 5,189 5,724 5,522 Total operating expenses 15,823 16,370 18,854 Net operating income loss 2,696 2,357 407 Other income, net 227 1,910 936 Net interest expense 941 1,439 1,579 Income taxes 539 459 385 Minority interests 8 12 10 Equity in earnings losses of investees 34 329 1,443 Income loss from continuing operations 1,417 2,686 2,888 Discontinued operations 3,883 Net income 1,417 2,686 995 Earnings per share basic 16.4p 31.2p 12.0p Earnings per share diluted 16.3p 31.0p 11.9p 133 United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 ix US GAAP developments In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued Financial Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities and in December 2003 issued a revised interpretation, FIN 46R.
The interpretation requires the primary beneciary to consolidate a variable interest entity if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys losses if they occur, or receive a majority of the entitys expected returns or both.
BT had adopted FIN 46 in June 2003, and the further adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material effect on the results or statement of financial position of the group.
In May 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No.
150 Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity.
150 establishes standards for how to classify and measure certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity.
It requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability, or an asset in some circumstances.
150 did not have a material effect on the results or statement of financial position of the group.
In November 2002 the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on EITF 00-21 Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables.
BT adopted this consensus for contracts entered into after 15 June 2003.
Adoption of the consensus did not have a material impact on the results of the group.
