qxd 13 3 05 12:19 pm Page 68 Notes to the financial statements continued 27 Commitments and contingencies continued d Litigation The group has a number of outstanding disputes arising out of its normal activities, for which provisions have been made, where appropriate, in accordance with FRS 12. e Guarantees and indemnities The company has 915 million of bilateral credit facilities 2003: 915 million.
Hydrocarbon Resources Limited and British Gas Trading Limited have guaranteed, jointly and severally, to pay on demand any sum which the company does not pay in accordance with the facility agreements.
In relation to the sale and leaseback of the Morecambe gas field tangible fixed assets recorded in these financial statements, the group has given guarantees amounting to 22 million 2003: 60 million.
The group has given guarantees in connection with the finance lease obligations relating to Humber Power Limited referred to in note 13.
A fixed collateral payment amounting to 225 million 2003: 225 million is required in the event of Centrica plc failing to retain at least one credit rating which is not on credit watch above the BBB Baa1 level, and further collateral of 75 million 2003: 75 million is required if the credit rating falls further.
Group companies have given guarantees and indemnities, subject to certain limitations, to various counterparties in relation to wholesale energy trading and procurement activities, and to third parties in respect of gas production and energy transportation liabilities.
In connection with their energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain group companies have entered into contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant deterioration in credit worthiness.
The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point of deterioration.
Following the closure of the British Gas Energy Centres Limited Energy Centres operations in July 1999, guarantees have been signed on certain former Energy Centres properties as a result of reassignment of leases.
f Gas purchase contracts The group is contracted to purchase 94 billion therms of gas 2003: 76 billion therms in Britain under long-term contracts.
In 2002 the group entered into a contract with Gasunie to purchase an additional 27 billion therms over 10 years.
This commitment was conditional at 31 December 2003.
During 2004 it became unconditional and is therefore included in the 2004 figures below.
Other increases on last year are largely due to the signing of gas procurement contracts with Shell, HydroWingas and Statoil.
The long-term supply of LNG from Petronas is not included as not all of the conditions precedent have been fulfilled or waived.
The gas contract commitments also include several contracts with prices linked to the market price for gas and legacy contracts at prices, mainly determined by various baskets of indices including oil prices and general inflation, which may exceed market gas prices from time to time.
The total volume of gas to be taken under these long-term contracts depends upon a number of factors, including the actual reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis.
Based upon the minimum volume of gas that the group is contracted to pay for in any year, the profile of the contract commitments is estimated as follows: 2004 2003 million therms million therms Within five years 59,500 43,500 After five years 34,600 32,400 94,100 75,900 The directors do not consider it feasible to estimate reliably the actual future cost of committed gas purchases as the groups weighted average cost of gas from these contracts is subject to a variety of indexation bases.
The groups average cost of gas from its contracts with third parties for the year ended 31 December 2004 was 24.3 pence per therm for the year ended 31 December 2003: 20.8 pence per therm.
2004 2003 The commitment profile on this same basis is set out below: m m Within one year 2,700 2,200 Between one and five years 11,800 6,800 After five years 8,400 6,700 22,900 15,700 g Other The groups use of financial instruments is explained in the group financial review on pages 19 to 21 and in note 29.
In October 2004 the group commenced an energy tolling agreement with the owners of a new gas-fired power station at Spalding, Lincolnshire for an initial 17-year period under which Centrica acquires the total plant capacity rights for a combination of fixed and market related tolling payments.
