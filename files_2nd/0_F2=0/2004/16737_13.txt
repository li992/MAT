Notes to the Accounts Notes to the Accounts 31 March 2004 1.
Basis of Consolidation and Presentation of Financial Information The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 March 2004.
No separate profit and loss account is presented for Viridian Group PLC as permitted by Article 238 3 of the Companies Northern Ireland Order 1986.
Entities in which the Group held an interest on a long-term basis and which were jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement were treated as joint ventures.
In the Group accounts, joint ventures were accounted for using the gross equity method.
Entities, other than subsidiary undertakings or joint ventures, in which the Group had a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercised a significant influence were treated as associates.
In the Group accounts, associates were accounted for using the equity method.
"As more fully explained in note 1 to the 1998 accounts, the conditions for merger accounting set out in FRS 6 ""Acquisitions and Mergers"" and schedule 4 A to the Companies Northern Ireland Order 1986 were not fully met in the Group reconstruction which led to the acquisition by the Company of NIE."
However the directors considered that if acquisition accounting had been applied, the Group accounts would have failed to show a true and fair view for the shareholders since they had a continuing interest in NIE before and after the reconstruction.
Accordingly merger accounting was applied.
No quantification has been given of this departure because to do so would be misleading.
Accounting Policies Accounting convention The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards except as indicated in note 1 above.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
The charge for depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis, except for infrastructure assets as referred to below.
The lives of each major class of depreciable asset are as follows: Infrastructure assets 40 years Depreciation is charged at 3% for 20 years followed by 2% for the remaining 20 years Generation assets Up to 30 years Non-operational buildings - freehold and long leasehold Up to 50 years Fixtures and equipment Up to 25 years Vehicles and mobile plant Up to 5 years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Page Thirty-three Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003-2004 Goodwill Goodwill may arise on the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings, the trade and assets of a business, and interests in joint ventures.
It represents the excess of cost over fair value of the Groups share of tangible assets acquired.
"In accordance with FRS 10 ""Goodwill and Intangible Assets"", such goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised by equal instalments against profit over its estimated useful economic life which usually does not exceed 20 years."
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, except that software development expenditure incurred on specific projects is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised by equal instalments against profit over its estimated useful economic life.
Investments Current asset investments are shown at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward foreign currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or where appropriate at the forward contract rate.
The accounts of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the retranslation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves.
All other translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in foreign enterprises, which are taken directly to reserves.
Financial Instruments Financial instruments and derivatives are used to hedge interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity risks.
Profits and losses on financial instruments and derivatives are reported in the profit and loss account in the period in which the underlying hedged transactions are recognised.
The Group does not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Financial Review on pages 8 to 10 provides detail on how the Group manages its financial risks: and disclosure of the Groups financial instruments is set out in note 31.
Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of average purchase price and net realisable value.
Pension costs The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution pension arrangements.
Pension costs in respect of defined benefit arrangements are assessed by qualified actuaries and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to recognise the expected cost of benefits over members' working lives with the employer.
Pension costs in respect of defined contribution arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Grants Grants received in respect of expenditure charged to the profit and loss account during the year are included in the profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences arising from the different treatment for accounts and taxation purposes of transactions and events recognised in the accounts of the current year and previous years.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred taxation assets and liabilities.
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of gains arising from the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, by the balance sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.
Page Thirty-four Notes to the Accounts Deferred income Grants and customers' contributions received in respect of fixed assets are deferred and released to the profit and loss account by instalments over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Support and maintenance revenue is deferred on invoicing and released to the profit and loss account over the term of the support and maintenance period.
Software licence revenue Revenue in respect of software licences is recognised where delivery is complete and there are no future elements to be delivered or there are no significant customisations which are essential to the functionality of the delivered element.
Where the software requires significant customisation over an extended period, licence revenue is recognised over the period of implementation on a percentage complete basis.
Long-term contract accounting Profit on long-term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The profit included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the period end, by recording turnover and related costs as contract activity progresses.
Turnover is calculated as that proportion of total contract value which costs incurred to date bear to total expected costs for that contract.
Revenues derived from variations on contracts are recognised only when they have been accepted by the customer.
Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Hire purchase and finance lease contracts Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Capitalised interest Interest on the funding attributable to significant capital projects is capitalised during the period of construction and written off as part of the total cost over the operational life of the asset.
All other interest payable and receivable is reflected in the profit and loss account as it arises.
Bid costs The Group expenses, when incurred, all bid costs and other related costs where recovery is not specifically provided for in accordance with the contract terms, except that directly attributed costs which can be separately identified and reliably measured are recognised as assets when it is virtually certain that a contract will be achieved and that contract is expected to generate future net cash inflows with a net present value at least equal to the amounts recognised as an asset.
Costs incurred before this level of certainty is obtained are not subsequently reinstated.
Decommissioning Provision is made where appropriate for the estimated decommissioning costs at the end of the producing lives of the Groups infrastructure and generation assets on a discounted basis.
Capitalised decommissioning costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets.
The unwinding of the discount is included within net interest payable.

Turnover and Segmental Information Turnover represents the invoiced value of goods sold and services provided, exclusive of value added tax, with the following exceptions: electricity sales, which include an estimate of the sales value of units supplied to customers between the date of the last meter reading and the period end: and software licence revenue, support and maintenance revenue and turnover in respect of long-term contracts which are recognised in accordance with the accounting polices set out in note 2.
Discontinued operations comprise the Moyle Interconnector and Fleet as set out in note 14.
Turnover and Segmental Information Continued In addition to the disclosures required under SSAP 25 given above, the directors believe the following breakdown of NIE's business according to its regulated entitlement is useful to shareholders: Turnover Operating profit 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Based on regulated entitlement: Power Procurement SONI 383.1 343.7 5.6 5.9 Transmission and Distribution 164.9 168.6 73.9 76.2 NIE Supply 447.0 452.2 5.8 7.8 Other 0.2 0.3 0.1 - Inter-group elimination 428.2 441.3 - - 567.0 523.5 85.4 89.9 Adjustment for under-recovery 9.5 - 9.5 - 557.5 523.5 75.9 89.9 The under-recovery adjustment represents the amount by which NIE under-recovered against its regulated entitlement.
Segmental information by destination is not materially different from that disclosed above by origin.

Tax on Profit on Ordinary Activities Continued ii Factors affecting tax charge for the year The tax assessed for the year varies from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30%.

From 1 April 2005, this capital expenditure can no longer be treated as revenue for tax purposes.
Profit for the Financial Year The profit dealt with in the accounts of the parent company was 28.2m 2003 - 29.5m.
Dividends These dividends are all in respect of equity shares.

Earnings per Share The calculation of basic earnings per ordinary share is based on profit of 74.3m 2003 - 51.7m and on 132.8m 2003 132.0m ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year excluding the shares owned by the Quest.
The calculation of basic diluted earnings per share is based on profit of 74.3m 2003 - 51.7m and on 133.0m 2003 132.2m ordinary shares, calculated as follows: 2004 2003 No.
Basic weighted average number of shares million 132.8 132.0 Dilutive potential ordinary shares: Employee sharesave and executive share options million 0.2 0.2 133.0 132.2 In prior years, the Group has also presented adjusted earnings per share in its financial statements, based on profit before goodwill amortisation and non-operating exceptional items, and before accounting for deferred tax as the directors believed this gave a more meaningful comparison of financial performance.
In any given year, NIEs regulated businesses may or may not experience a net over or under-recovery against the revenue to which they are entitled under their regulatory formulae.
Such over or under-recovery is corrected through the following years tariffs.
Under FRS 14 Earnings per share, the Group is not able to adjust earnings for such over or under-recovery but the directors have accepted any difference against adjusted earnings per share as it has not been significant.
However, in the year ended 31 March 2004 NIE has significantly under-recovered its net regulatory entitlement.
As a result the directors have decided that this measure of adjusted earnings per share no longer allows for a meaningful comparison of financial performance to be made.
Accordingly it has been withdrawn from the financial statements.
The directors believe that the performance of NIEs regulated businesses is best assessed by reference to their regulated entitlement and as a result the directors present both basic earnings per share under FRS 14 and earnings per share on a pro-forma basis in the Financial Review.

"The holder of the special share ""Special Shareholder"" is entitled to receive notice of, and to attend and speak at, any general meeting or separate meetings, but not to vote or exercise any other rights at any such meeting."
The Special Share confers no right to participate in the capital or profits of the Company except that, on winding-up of the Company, the Special Shareholder shall be entitled to repayment in priority to other shareholders.
The Special Share was redeemed on 5 May 2004. b Employee Share Schemes The Group has established an all employee Sharesave Scheme and a discretionary Executive Share Option Scheme.
Shares under option in the Sharesave Scheme and the Executive Share Option Scheme at 31 March 2004 were as follows: Sharesave Scheme Date of grant Number of Number of Exercise price Normal date participants shares per share of exercise 7 January 1997 4 6,711 287.0p March 2004 - August 2004 12 December 2002 1,253 1,712,143 402.0p February 2006 - July 2006 Employees enter into a savings contract over a fixed period, at the end of which time they have the option to buy ordinary shares of the Company at a price fixed at the time of grant of the option.
Options may be exercised earlier than the normal date in special circumstances such as death or ceasing employment due to injury, redundancy, retirement or sale of the business.
During the year 276 participants exercised options in respect of 440,610 shares for a total consideration of 1.4m.
Page Fifty-two Notes to the Accounts 23.
No directors have been granted options since 5 July 1993.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Scheme are exercisable within a period of 10 years from the date of grant and entitle the participant to acquire ordinary shares in the Company at a price determined at the time options were granted by the Board.
The price of the option is not less than the higher of the nominal value of the share and the market value of a share on the dealing day immediately preceding or, if the Board so determines, the average market value over the three dealing days preceding the date of grant.
Options are normally only exercisable after three years from the date of grant by a participant who remains in the Group's employment.

Pension Commitments Most employees of the Group are members of the Viridian Group Pension Scheme VGPS.
"This has three sections: ""Options"" which is a money purchase arrangement whereby the Group matches the members contributions up to a maximum of 6% of salary, ""Focus"" which provides benefits based on pensionable salary at retirement or earlier exit from service and the ""Public Sector"" section, which provides final salary related benefits for certain employees who have joined from the public sector under outsourcing contracts."
In addition, there is a money purchase arrangement for employees in the RoI known as Choices: its benefits mirror those of the Options section of VGPS.
The assets of the schemes are held under trust and invested by the trustees on the advice of professional investment managers.
The pension cost for the year in respect of benefits under the schemes was 15.8m 2003 - 0.1m.
The Groups contributions to the schemes totalled 15.8m 2003 - 0.1m.
A prepayment of 8.9m is included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2004 2003 - 8.9m.
This represents the difference between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the profit and loss account.
The net pension charge in respect of the Focus and Public Sector sections of VGPS is derived from a regular cost of 14.9% of salaries, increased by a variation charge of 7.9m, which represents the amortisation of the pension deficit over 15 years, the average remaining service life of employees as at 31 March 2003 2003 - 9.0m credit in respect of the amortisation of surplus assets over 13 years, the average remaining service life of employees as at 31 March 2000.
The pension cost has been determined in accordance with the advice of Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, based on the latest actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2003.
For accounting purposes, the attained age method was adopted, and the most significant actuarial assumptions were that investment returns at 7.6% per annum pre-retirement would exceed general salary increases by 4.0% per annum and investment returns of 6.1% per annum post-retirement would exceed future pension increases by 3.4% per annum.
The market value of the Focus and Public Sector sections assets as at 31 March 2003 was 593m.
The actuarial value of the assets represented 87% of the actuarial value of the accrued benefits.
The accrued benefits include all benefits for pensioners and other former members as well as benefits based on completed service and projected salaries for active members.
The Group is making contributions to make the deficit good over the remaining service life of the employees at the rates recommended by the schemes actuaries, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow.
FRS 17 disclosures Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow have provided a valuation of the Focus and Public Sector sections under FRS 17 as at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit method.
The valuation at 31 March 2004 showed a decrease in the deficit before deferred tax from 194.0m to 168.6m.
The major assumptions used were in nominal terms : 2004 2003 2002 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 3.9% per annum 3.6% per annum 4.0% per annum Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0% per annum 2.7% per annum 2.7% per annum Discount rate 5.5% per annum 5.4% per annum 5.1% per annum Inflation assumption 2.9% per annum 2.6% per annum 2.5% per annum Page Fifty-five Viridian Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003-2004 25.

Commitments and Contingent Liabilities a Capital commitments Group 2004 2003 m m Contracted future capital expenditure 14.3 75.3 b Other contractual commitments NIE entered into power purchase agreements with generating companies in Northern Ireland in March 1992 to make payments for the availability of generating capacity as well as for the purchase of electricity generated.
The principal remaining contracts are with Premier Power Ltd Ballylumford and AES Kilroot Power Ltd Kilroot.
The Ballylumford contracts expire in 2012 but NIE has options to extend them by up to 10 years.
The Kilroot contracts expire in 2024 but Ofreg has early contract cancellation rights that can be exercised from November 2010.
"In December 2000 a number of the contracts at Ballylumford were renegotiated and in addition a contract buy-out agreement ""CBO"" was entered into to make payments to fund a buy-out of the profit element under the original agreements at Ballylumford."
The CBO agreement has provisions under which a termination amount becomes payable in certain circumstances.
The extent of the payment will depend on the date on which such a termination event arises.
NIE does not anticipate that any liability will arise and no provision has been made.
In July 2003 NIE agreed to sell 170MW of capacity to ESB in the RoI through the North-South interconnector which links the Northern Ireland and RoI electricity systems, having contracted to purchase this capacity from units no longer under long-term contract at Ballylumford.
NIE has also entered into the following power purchase contracts: i agreements with renewable generators under the Non Fossil Fuel Orders which expire between 2009 and 2013: and ii an agreement with Scottish Power to purchase electricity through the Moyle Interconnector which expires in 2007.
In order to meet their wholesale and retail supply commitments, Viridian Energy Ltd and Viridian Energy Supply Ltd have entered into a portfolio of power purchase and capacity agreements which expire between 2005 and 2018.
Performance bonds and guarantees The Group has entered into several letters of credit, performance bonds and guarantees totalling 39.7m 2003 - 19.5m, of which the Company has guaranteed 32.3m, in relation to the trading activities of Viridian Power & Energy, NIE Powerteam and Sx3.
The Group does not anticipate that any liability will arise and no provision has been made.
Page Fifty-eight Notes to the Accounts 27.
Commitments and Contingent Liabilities Continued The Group has guaranteed Viridian Energy Ltds obligations under its Fuel Purchase and Energy Sale Agreement with Huntstown Power Company Ltd for a period of 15 years.
The Group has also guaranteed 85% of Viridian Energy Supply Ltds obligations under a power purchase agreement with Windfarm Developments Ltd in relation to the Altahullion windfarm for a period of 15 years.
The Group has given a number of guarantees in relation to short-term power purchase, gas purchase and financial swap contracts with a number of counterparties for a period of 1 to 3 years.
c Contingent liabilities Protected Persons The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of obligations under the Electricity Protected Persons Pensions Regulations Northern Ireland 1992 for employees of NIE at privatisation.
This includes members employed in companies which have subsequently been disposed of by the Group.
The Group does not anticipate that any liability will arise other than that disclosed in note 5 with respect to Lislyn.
Power station sites NIE lease sites to power stations in Northern Ireland.
Under the terms of the lease agreements NIE may be required to pay compensation if a lease is terminated.
The extent of the compensation will depend on the circumstances which give rise to the termination.
NIE does not anticipate that any liability for compensation will arise and no provision has been made.
Power station agreements Under the terms of the power station agreements between NIE and generators in Northern Ireland, where modifications to generating equipment are necessary and a generator is unable to procure the necessary financing, NIE must either provide such finance or pay the costs incurred by the generator in carrying out such modifications.
The costs incurred by NIE in meeting these obligations are recoverable under its licences, but will require to be financed by NIE until such recovery is achieved.
"Property clawback A clawback debenture was entered into in 1993 which entitles DETI to a proportion of any property gain above certain thresholds accruing or treated as accruing to the Company or any member of the Group as a result of disposals, or events treated as disposals ""deemed disposals"", occurring after 31 March 1993 in relation to land and any buildings on that land in which NIE had an interest at 31 March 1993."
These arrangements lasted until 31 March 2003.
A provision for clawback in respect of property disposals would be made only to the extent that it is probable that a liability will crystallise.
Such a liability may crystallise when an actual or deemed disposal occurs.
NIE is in dispute with DETI in connection with valuations relating to the possibility of any clawback liability payable to DETI as a result of disposal by NIE of property at its Danesfort site and of some other retail properties.
The parties have agreed that the dispute should be determined by an independent expert under the terms of the clawback debenture.

Financial Instruments Continued Foreign currency risk Borrowings denominated in Euro have been used to offset the impact on the Group's balance sheet of exchange rate movements on fixed assets relating to the Huntstown plant.
Financial instruments, primarily forward contracts, have been used to hedge foreign currency exposures into functional currencies.
As at 31 March 2004 the Group had Euro denominated financial assets of nil 2003 - 2.2m in respect of Group operations where the functional currency is Sterling.
Hedging As described on pages 8 to 10, the Group uses swap contracts to hedge commodity exposures from energy purchases, interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile and forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposures.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the accounts until the hedged position matures.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Unrecognised total net losses m Losses on hedges as at 1 April 2003 17.8 Losses arising in previous years included in current year profit and loss account 6.9 Losses arising before 1 April 2003 not included in current year profit and loss account 10.9 Losses arising in current year 2.6 Net losses on hedges at 31 March 2004 13.5 Of which Losses expected to be recognised in 2004 05 2.7 Losses expected to be recognised in 2005 06 or later 10.8 Fair value The estimated fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value Note 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Assets Investments cash at bank and in hand 1 58.4 45.9 58.4 45.9 Loan notes 2 11.9 14.3 11.9 14.3 Liabilities Short-term debt 3 5.7 66.1 5.7 67.5 Long-term debt 4 435.1 501.7 454.3 522.1 Financial instruments Commodity swap contracts 5 - - 0.9 0.1 Interest rate swap contracts 5 - - 15.3 14.7 Forward currency contracts 6 - - 0.9 3.0 Page Sixty-two Notes to the Accounts 31.
The fair value of investments cash at bank and in hand approximates to carrying value due to the short maturity of instruments held.
The fair value of loan notes has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of short-term debt has been calculated by discounting the expected future cashflows at prevailing interest rates.
The fair value of the Eurobond at the reporting date has been estimated at quoted market rates and the fair value of other items has been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
