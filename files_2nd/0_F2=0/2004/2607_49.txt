NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 28 Financial commitments Burberry Group had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases as follows: As at 31 March 2004 As at 31 March 2003 Land and Land and buildings Other Total buildings Other Total m m m m m m Expiry date: Within one year 2.3 0.5 2.8 1.9 1.9 Between two and five years 6.7 0.2 6.9 6.3 6.3 After five years 12.5 12.5 9.4 9.4 Total 21.5 0.7 22.2 17.6 17.6 The financial commitments for operating lease amounts calculated as a percentage of turnover turnover leases, have been based on the minimum payment that is required under the terms of the relevant lease.
Under certain turnover leases there are no minimums and therefore no financial commitment is included in the table above.
As a result, the amounts charged to the profit and loss account may be materially higher than the financial commitment at the prior year end.
29 Capital commitments Capital commitments contracted but not provided for by Burberry Group as at 31 March 2004 amounted to 14.2m 2003: 6.9m.
Contracted capital commitments represent contracts entered into by the year end and major capital expenditure projects where activity has commenced by the year end.
30 Contingent liabilities Since 31 March 2003 the following changes to contingent liabilities have occurred: The claim for 2.4m received from a number of the vendors of the Asian distribution businesses acquired on 31 December 2001 was settled in October 2003.
The settlement was fully provided for as at 31 March 2003.
The Group has received a claim from the liquidator of Creation Cent Mille SA CCM a former licensee of Burberry Group, seeking to set aside the termination of the licence agreement between Burberry Limited and CCM.
Burberry Group believes this claim is without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself.
The Group was named as one of approximately 100 defendants in a class action in California, US, which alleges that employees job application processes violated the Californian Labor Code.
This action is in the course of being settled for an amount that is not anticipated to be material.
Other contingent liabilities reported at 31 March 2003 remain unchanged and were: Under the GUS group UK tax payment arrangements, the Group is and will remain jointly and severally liable for any GUS liability attributable to the period of Burberry Groups membership of this payment scheme.
Burberry Groups membership of this scheme was terminated with effect from 31 March 2002.
Burberry Spain S. A. is liable for certain salary and social security contributions left unpaid by its sole contractors where the amounts are attributable to the period in which sub-contracting activity is undertaken on behalf of Burberry Spain S. A.
It is not feasible to estimate the amount of contingent liability, but such expense has been minimal in prior years.
In the year to 31 March 2002, the Group received an invoice for 0.5m in respect of construction works at the Bond Street site from its former lessor.
The Burberry Group has notified the other party that it is seeking recovery of certain costs incurred because of the late delivery of the store structure.
The Burberry Group has now received a formal claim, for this amount plus interest, and intends to defend its position.
