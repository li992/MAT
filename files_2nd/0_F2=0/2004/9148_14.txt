The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for land and buildings that are included in the financial statements at valuation, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
However, compliance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties relating to depreciation on investment properties and FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets relating to the capitalisation and amortisation of goodwill both require a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 as explained below.
Accounting policies used are consistent with the prior year except for the adoption of Application Note G of Financial Reporting Standard 5 Revenue Recognition and Urgent Issues Task Force 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts which are detailed below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are recorded under the acquisition method and their results are included from the date of acquisition.
Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method and joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
The results of subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings which have been disposed during the year are included up to the effective date of disposal.
Kingfisher plc has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year end are translated into Sterling at year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and loss account.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at year end exchange rates.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiary undertakings are expressed in Sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening shareholders funds are recorded as a movement on reserves, and are reported in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Groups share of net assets or liabilities of associated undertakings and joint ventures are expressed in Sterling at year end exchange rates.
The share of profits or losses for the year are expressed in Sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net equity are recorded as a movement on reserves.
Exchange differences arising on borrowings used to finance, or provide a hedge against, Group equity investments in foreign subsidiaries are recorded as movements on reserves to the extent of exchange differences arising on the equity investments.
All other exchange movements are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Principal rate of exchange euro 2004 2003 Year end rate 1.465 1.531 Average rate 1.439 1.583 Turnover Turnover represents retail sales and services supplied, interest receivable and other income from the provision of credit facilities, rental income and turnover from property development activities.
Turnover excludes transactions made between companies within the Group, Value Added Tax, other sales-related taxes and is net of returns and trade discounts.
The financial and accounting policy impact of the implementation of Application Note G to FRS 5 Revenue Recognition on these financial statements is set out under Changes in presentation of financial information below.
Cost of sales Cost of sales is the expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing the product to the point of sale, including warehouse and transportation costs.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 27 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Goodwill, which represents the difference between the purchase consideration and the fair values of the net assets acquired, is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over a period which represents the directors estimate of its useful economic life.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill arising, account has been taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and expected future impact of competition.
Negative goodwill is amortised to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the non-monetary assets acquired are recovered whether through depreciation or sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 31 January 1998 is included in the balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation and any provisions for impairment.
Goodwill related to joint ventures and associated undertakings is included in the carrying value of the investment.
Where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite life, it is not amortised.
The estimated useful economic life is regarded as indefinite where goodwill is capable of continued measurement and the durability of the acquired business can be demonstrated.
Where goodwill is not amortised, an annual impairment review is performed and any impairment charged to the profit and loss account.
During the current year, the directors reviewed the remaining life of Screwfix Direct and have concluded that, based on the resilience and sustainability of this business, the remaining goodwill has an indefinite life.
An indefinite life is also applied on the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the minority interest in Castorama Dubois Investissements S. C. A. and the goodwill that arose on the purchase of the Groups initial equity investment in Hornbach Holding A. G. The directors consider that each of these businesses has a proven ability to maintain its market leading position over a long period and can adapt successfully to any reasonably foreseeable technological or customer-led changes and that barriers to entry into each market exist, such that the businesses and their related goodwill will prove to be durable.
In this regard, in order to give a true and fair view, the financial statements depart from the requirement of amortising goodwill over a finite period, as required by the Companies Act.
Instead, annual impairment tests are undertaken and any impairment that is identified is charged to the profit and loss account.
It is not possible to quantify the effect of the departure from the Companies Act, because no finite life for goodwill can be identified.
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 31 January 1998 remains eliminated against reserves.
On the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates, this goodwill is charged in the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are included in the balance sheet at cost or valuation, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is provided to reflect a reduction from cost to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
Depreciation of tangible fixed assets is calculated using the straight line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Freehold and long leasehold buildings between 2% and 5% Short leaseholds over remaining period of the lease Tenants fixtures between 10% and 25% Computers and electronic equipment between 25% and 50% Motor cars 25% 1 Commercial vehicles between 10% and 33 3% Freehold land is not depreciated.
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or net realisable value if higher.
The discount rate is applied based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustments for the risks associated with the relevant business.
Any impairment in value is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it occurs.
Disposal of land and buildings Profits and losses on disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an exchange of unconditional contracts.
Investments Fixed asset other than joint ventures and associates and current asset investments are included in the balance sheet at cost, less any provisions for impairment.
Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they have been purchased outright.
The amount capitalised is the present value of the minimum lease payments during the lease term and the assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful economic life.
Obligations relating to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future periods, are included as appropriate under creditors due within or after one year.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental payments are charged to the profit and loss account in the financial year to which the payments relate.
28 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Incentives received to enter into lease agreements are released to the profit and loss account over the lease term or, if shorter, the period to the date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate.
Properties The Groups freehold operating properties are revalued annually on a rolling basis and included in the balance sheet at existing use value.
Investment properties are revalued annually and included in the balance sheet at their open market value.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation is provided in respect of investment properties.
This represents a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements to provide for the systematic annual depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are held for investment and the directors consider that the adoption of the above policy is necessary in order to give a true and fair view.
It is not possible to quantify the effect of the departure from the Companies Act, because no useful economic life is deemed appropriate.
Capitalisation of interest Interest on borrowings to finance property development is capitalised from the date work starts on the development to practical completion.
Interest on borrowings to finance the construction of properties held as tangible fixed assets is capitalised from the date work starts on the property to the date when substantially all the activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete.
Where construction is completed in parts, each part is considered separately when capitalising interest.
Interest is capitalised before any allowance for tax relief.
Property developments Property developments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Development profits are taken when developments are sold.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads and direct expenditure incurred in the normal course of business in bringing goods to their present location and condition.
Rebates receivable from suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year the rebates are recognised in the accounts in the period in which they are earned.
Pensions The Group operates defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes for its employees.
In each case a separate fund is being accumulated to meet the accruing liabilities.
The assets of each of these funds are either held under trusts or managed by insurance companies, and are entirely separate from the Groups assets.
In accordance with SSAP 24, the cost of pensions in respect of the Groups defined benefit schemes is charged to the profit and loss account so that it is spread over the working lives of employees.
Variations to pension costs caused by differences between the assumptions used and actual experience are spread over the average remaining working lives of the current employees at each actuarial valuation date.
In the Groups overseas companies, any defined benefit arrangements are generally funded by way of annual premiums to Group pension arrangements managed by insurance companies.
Deferred taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the incremental provision approach and is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date subject to the following: a Deferred tax is not recognised on the revaluation of non-monetary assets such as property unless a binding sale agreement exists at the balance sheet date.
Where rollover relief is available on an asset then deferred tax is in any case not recognised.
b Deferred tax is not recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures unless dividends have been accrued as receivable or there is a binding agreement to distribute past earnings at the balance sheet date.
c Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Assets are regarded as recoverable when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
d Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent differences.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 29 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments Financial assets are recognised on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premiums are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Termination payments made or received in respect of derivatives are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist and taken to the profit and loss account where the underlying exposure ceases to exist.
Outstanding contracts used to hedge against trading items which themselves will be accounted for in the profits or losses of a future period are not recognised, or are deferred when they mature, and are carried forward against corresponding gains and losses when they occur.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments held for hedging purposes is recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period in which it arises.
For the purposes of notes 21, 22 and 24 to 27, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded.
The narrative disclosures required by FRS 13 are set out on page 20 in the financial review.
Employee Share Ownership Plan The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
The impact of the implementation of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts on these financial statements is set out under Changes in presentation of financial information below.
Changes in presentation of financial information Application Note G of Financial Reporting Standard 5 Revenue Recognition has been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
Accordingly, a provision for customer returns has now been made representing the Groups estimate of the amount of product sold during the year which will be returned in the following year.
The new Application Note also requires turnover and associated costs to be recognised when a product or service has been delivered or performed rather than at time of customer payment.
This affects only a small component of the Groups activities relating to installations and delivered products and impacts the timing of revenue and profit recognition only.
These changes have been accounted for as a prior period adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly.
If the previous policy in respect of these items had been adopted in the current year, the impact would have been to increase sales by 21.2m and profit after tax by 9.2m.
The impact of adopting the new policy on the year ended 1 February 2003 has been to reduce sales by 13.7m and profit after tax by 4.0m.
The cumulative effect of this prior year adjustment on the balance sheet as at 1 February 2003 is an increase in the provision for customer returns of 5.1m, an increase in deferred income of 13.2m, offset by a decrease in deferred tax of 5.0m giving rise to a decrease in reserves of 13.3m.
Urgent Issues Task Force 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts has been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
As required by the UITF, own shares held by the Kingfisher Employee Share Ownership Trust have been reclassified from fixed asset investments to a reduction in shareholders funds.
The shares will be held at historical cost until such time as they are disposed of.
Any profit or loss on the disposal of own shares is treated as a movement in reserves rather than as a profit and loss item.
This change has been accounted for as a prior period adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly.
If the previous policy had been adopted in the current year, the impact would have been to reduce profit after tax by 4.4m.
The impact of adopting the new policy on the year ended 1 February 2003 has been to increase profit after tax by 4.9m.
The cumulative effect of this prior year adjustment on the balance sheet as at 1 February 2003 is to reduce other investments and profit and loss reserve by 132.3m.
The assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP continue to be included in the consolidated and the Companys financial statements.
The total impact had the previous policies continued in the current year would have been to increase profit after tax by 4.8m.
The total impact of adopting the new policies on the year ended 1 February 2003 has been to increase profit after tax by 0.9m.
The total cumulative effect of all the prior year adjustments on the balance sheet as at 1 February 2003 is a decrease in reserves of 145.6m.
The comparative figures have also been restated for the reallocation of the e-commerce sector loss of 14.1m to home improvement and electricals and the costs of the Lille head office of 14.1m from home improvement to other operating costs.
30 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Discontinued operations At an extraordinary general meeting on 4 July 2003, the shareholders of Kingfisher plc approved the demerger of the Groups electricals business to Kesa Electricals.
Shares in Kesa Electricals were admitted to the official list and commenced trading on the London Stock Exchange on 7 July 2003.
On demerger, the Company declared a dividend in specie, which was satisfied by the issue of shares in Kesa Electricals.
The dividend in specie of 1,592.9m represented the net assets of the business transferred to Kesa Electricals at the date of demerger, goodwill relating to Kesa Electricals that had previously been written off to reserves which was resurrected on demerger, less debt assumed by Kesa Electricals.
The existing shareholders of Kingfisher plc were given shares in Kesa Electricals on a ratio of 1 share in Kesa Electricals for every 5 shares held in Kingfisher plc after taking into account the Kesa Electricals share consolidation.
The results of activities transferred to Kesa Electricals up to the date of demerger are reported as discontinued operations in these financials statements and prior year numbers have been restated accordingly.
Discontinued operations also include the results of the activities of ProMarkt and the non-core home improvement businesses disposed of during the year, including the interest and taxation attributable to these operations.

Unallocated net liabilities comprise combined Group net debt and the net assets pertaining to the head office function.

The share of net interest payable by associates included above is 5.7m 2003: 2.9m.
The capitalisation rate used to determine the amount of finance costs capitalised during the period was 5.1% 2003: 4.9%.
Interest payable above includes amortisation of underwriting and issue costs of new debt of 1.5m 2003: 6.5m.
Of the net interest payable a total of 10.5m 2003: 31.1m was allocated to discontinued operations.
The majority of this related to the interest associated with the debt demerged with Kesa Electricals, and the remainder related to the home improvement businesses sold in the year.
The principle used in allocating interest was that the interest cost of discontinued activities was the additional interest cost arising as a result of retaining the discontinued activity up to the date of discontinuance.
Exceptional financing charges In addition to the net interest payable above, 86.9m of exceptional financing charges arose during the year 2003: nil.
This included a 27.7m cost relating to the restructuring of the Groups debt arising solely as a result of the demerger of Kesa Electricals, less a gain of 23.9m on unwinding an interest rate swap directly associated with the debt.
In addition, a cost of 83.1m was incurred in connection with part of a foreign exchange contract that was no longer required once the separation of Kesa Electricals by demerger was confirmed in April 2003.

10 Taxation 2004 2003 BeforeExceptional Total millions exceptional tax tax restated UK corporation tax Current tax on profits for the period 86.0 86.0 213.5 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 0.4 51.3 51.7 12.2 85.6 51.3 34.3 201.3 Double taxation relief 9.5 9.5 39.3 76.1 51.3 24.8 162.0 Foreign tax Current tax on profits for the period 91.0 98.5 189.5 55.6 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 4.2 23.9 19.7 95.2 74.6 169.8 55.6 Deferred tax 3.7 3.7 1.7 Associated undertakings 4.4 4.4 3.3 Joint ventures 2.1 2.1 2.5 174.1 23.3 197.4 221.7 Of the taxation set out above, a total of 8.4m was credited to discontinued operations 2003: charge of 19.9m, excluding the exceptional tax charge of 98.5m.
The exceptional tax charge of 98.5m relates to tax paid to the French tax authorities as a consequence of the demerger of Kesa Electricals.
The Group has initiated proceedings for the recovery of the tax paid and, although these proceedings may take some time to be resolved, considers that its risk of being ultimately liable for this amount is low.
Exceptional tax credits of 75.2m are releases of provisions in respect of prior year liabilities which have either been agreed with the relevant tax authorities or where the likelihood of any liability arising is now considered to be remote.
In certain circumstances it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals could be breached.
Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be significant, the Group actively monitors compliance with these conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 37 12 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP see note 35 which are treated as cancelled.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted for the share consolidation on 7 July 2003 as approved by the shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting on 4 July 2003, when the ordinary shares of 13.75p were consolidated on a 7 for 8 basis into ordinary shares 5 of 15 7p.
Figures for the prior year have been restated accordingly.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys shares during the year.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.
These exclude the effects of operating and non-operating exceptional items and acquisition goodwill amortisation to allow comparison to the prior year on a consistent basis.

CB Richard Ellis Chartered Surveyors and Valuers has carried out a valuation of such a representative sample as at 31 December 2003 and, based upon the results of these valuations, there have been internal valuations by qualified valuers employed by the Group of the remainder of B&Q Properties portfolio.
All properties owned by Castorama France and Brico Dpt were valued by FPD Savills Chartered Surveyors and Valuers and properties of Castorama Poland and Castorama Italy were valued by Cushman & Wakefield Healy Baker Chartered Surveyors and Valuers as at 31 December 2003.
Properties with any element of Group occupancy are valued on an existing use value basis, which does not take account of formal lease arrangements with Group companies or the Groups occupation of the premises.
Properties without Group occupancy are valued on the basis of open market value.
These valuation bases comply with the RICS Appraisal and Valuation Manual.

23 Currency risk To mitigate the effect of currency translation exposures arising from overseas investments, the Groups policy is to borrow in the local currencies of its principal operating subsidiaries.
Gains and losses arising on the financial instruments used to hedge the currency translation exposures are recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses to the extent that there are gains and losses arising on the overseas investments in accordance with SSAP 20.
After taking into account the effect of any hedging transactions entered into to manage currency exposures, there were no significant net foreign currency monetary assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The table below details the unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging and the movements therein as follows: At 31 January 2004 Gains Losses Total net gains millions losses Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 February 2003 42.1 40.1 2.0 Gains and losses arising in previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were recognised in the period to 31 January 2004 29.6 40.1 10.5 Gains and losses arising in the previous years or pre-acqusition periods that were not recognised in the period to 31 January 2004 12.5 12.5 Gains and losses arising in the period ending 31 January 2004 that were not recognised in that period 2.5 16.6 14.1 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 January 2004 15.0 16.6 1.6 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 2.9 16.6 13.7 Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 12.1 12.1 15.0 16.6 1.6 At 1 February 2003 Gains Losses Total net gains millions losses Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 3 February 2002 38.3 5.1 33.2 Gains and losses arising in previous years or pre-acquisition periods that were recognised in the period to 1 February 2003 18.4 0.9 17.5 Gains and losses arising in the previous years or pre-acqusition periods that were not recognised in the period to 1 February 2003 19.9 4.2 15.7 Gains and losses arising in the period ending 1 February 2003 that were not recognised in that period 22.2 35.9 13.7 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 February 2003 42.1 40.1 2.0 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised within one year 12.4 40.1 27.7 Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 29.7 29.7 42.1 40.1 2.0 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 February 2003 included unrealised losses of 33.1m in respect of a foreign exchange contract which, at that date, hedged expected euro receipts from the sale or Initial Public Offering IPO of Kesa Electricals.
As Kesa Electricals was subsequently demerged, part of the contract was no longer required, and was closed out in April 2003 at a loss of 83.1m, reflecting an adverse movement in the exchange rate since 2 February 2003.
This loss was recognised in the profit and loss account as an exceptional financing charge in the period to 31 January 2004.
A further loss of 45.9m arose on settlement of the remaining part of the swap contract at demerger date.
This has been offset through reserves against the gain arising on the repayment by Kesa Electricals of euro denominated loans at the date of demerger.
Gains and losses expected to be recognised after more than one year at 2 February 2003 included an unrecognised gain of 17.2m on an interest rate swap.
Subsequently debt associated with this swap was repaid as a consequence of the demerger of Kesa Electricals, and a gain on the swap of 23.9m was recognised in the period to 31 January 2004.

This provision arises through accounting for the UK pension costs under SSAP 24 see note 33.
The remaining pension provision of 11.6m 2003: 11.0m, relates to overseas pension schemes.
Within the onerous property contracts provision, the Group has provided against future liabilities for all properties sublet at a shortfall and long-term idle properties.
The provision is based on the value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
As a result of the adoption of Application Note G of FRS 5 in the current year see note 1, a provision for customer returns has been made representing the estimate of sales returns at the year end.
The provision is not discounted.
The deferred tax not provided on revalued properties relates to the tax that would arise net of available reliefs including capital losses if those properties were sold for the revalued amount.
Losses and other timing differences which have not been recognised as deferred tax assets will be recoverable when there are taxable profits available against which they can be relieved.
Losses not recognised have reduced largely as a result of the demerger of Kesa Electricals.
Deferred tax has been included on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries only where there is an intention to remit these in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is not discounted.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 55 33 Pension costs Pension schemes operated and regular pension costs SSAP 24 The Group operates a variety of pension arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes.
By far the most significant are the funded defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees.
The total pension charge in the profit and loss account of 44.7m 2003: 43.8m includes 2.3m 2003: 3.2m for the UK defined contribution scheme.
A formal actuarial valuation of the UK defined benefit scheme the Scheme was carried out by an independent professionally qualified actuary, at 31 March 2002, using the projected unit method of funding.
In this valuation, the assets were taken at their market value of 900m excluding AVCs.
A value was placed on the liabilities by discounting the anticipated future benefits, including allowance where appropriate for future increases in pension and pensionable salaries, using assumptions derived by reference to market conditions as at 31 March 2002.
The principal assumptions adopted for the future were an inflation rate of 3.0% p. a. an investment return on existing assets of 6.6% p. a. an investment return on future contributions of 6.6% p. a. pensionable pay increases of 4.6% p. a. and pension increases of 2.75% p. a.. On this basis, the assets were sufficient to cover over 101% of the Schemes liabilities.
The next valuation will be performed as at 31 March 2004.
The pension cost for this Scheme charged in the profit and loss account of 37.9m 2003: 35.2m is based on the formal actuarial valuation described above, adjusted to reflect market movements since the date of this valuation, and in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes are an inflation rate of 3.0% p. a. an investment return on existing assets of 7.1% p. a. an investment return on future contributions of 6.6% p. a. pensionable pay increases of 4.6% p. a. and pension increases of 2.75% p. a.. Variations against regular cost have been amortised using the straight line method.
The pension cost for the Scheme is 7.2m higher than the contributions paid into the Scheme by the Group during the year.
The contributions paid into the Scheme are in line with the contribution rate as advised by the actuary following the valuation at 31 March 2004.
There are also funded and unfunded defined benefit arrangements covering senior executives in France, for which the charge in profit and loss account was 2.0m 2003: 4.8m.
A further 2.5m charge 2003: 0.6m has been reflected in the profit and loss account in respect of other overseas pension arrangements.
FRS 17 disclosures The Accounting Standards Board has deferred the full mandatory adoption of FRS 17 as a result of the planned move to International Financial Reporting Standards.
Instead the transitional disclosure requirements will continue.
The valuation of the Scheme used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the Groups UK Scheme at 31 March 2002 and updated to 31 January 2004 and takes into account the transitional requirements of FRS 17.
The financial assumptions used to calculate estimated Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 2004 2003 2002 Annual percentage rate % %% Discount rate 5.6 5.5 5.7 Salary escalation 4.3 3.9 4.0 Rate of pension increases 2.7 2.3 2.4 Price inflation 2.7 2.3 2.4 The assets in the Scheme at 31 January 2004 and the expected future rates of return on them were: 2004 2003 2002 millions % millions % millions % Equities 566 8.0 388 8.5 702 8.5 Bonds 254 5.0 288 4.7 143 4.7 Property 32 6.5 7 7.0 7.0 Other principally cash 57 3.7 99 3.8 223 3.8 Total market value of assets 909 6.5 782 6.5 1,068 6.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,179 1,050 1,228 Deficit in the scheme 270 268 160 Related deferred tax asset 81 80 48 Net pension liability 189 188 112 The assets and liabilities in the Scheme at 2 February 2002 relating to Superdrug and Woolworths scheme members were transferred out of the Scheme during 2002 3.
