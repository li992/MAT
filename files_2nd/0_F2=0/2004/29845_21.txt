Accordingly, the disclosures required are set out below: Directors The remuneration of the directors is set out in the Report on directors remuneration.
There were no contracts subsisting during or at the end of the year in which a director of the Company is or was interested and which are or were significant in relation to the Companys business.
There were no other material transactions during the year with the directors of the Company.
21 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Companys investing activities undertaken in pursuit of its investment objective as set out on page 1 involve certain inherent risks.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is market price risk which includes interest rate risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks as summarised below.
These policies have remained substantially unchanged during the current and preceding periods.
TEMPLE BAR INVESTMENT TRUST 35 Notes to the accounts continued 21 RISK MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Board meets on seven scheduled occasions in each year and at each meeting it receives sufficient financial and statistical information to enable it to monitor adequately the investment performance and status of the business.
In addition, financial information is circulated to the directors on a monthly basis.
The Board has also established a series of investment parameters, which are reviewed annually, designed to limit the risk inherent in managing a portfolio of investments.
The Company does not hedge risk.
The Companys borrowings have the effect of increasing the risk faced by shareholders.
This gearing effect is such that, for example, for a 10% movement in the valuation of the Companys investments, the net assets attributable to shareholders would move by approximately 12%.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through retained profits including realised and unrealised capital profits, and additional financing is obtained through the two debenture stocks in issue, on which interest is paid at a fixed rate.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities, which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of cash balances and short term bank deposits.
Financial assets The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date with the exception of the Companys fixed interest holdings in corporate and treasury bonds totalling 14,228,000 representing 3.7% of net assets of 389,198,000 2003: 16,550,000: 5.0%.
Of these, the weighted average running yield as at 31 December 2004 was 6.4% 2003: 6.1% and the weighted average remaining life was 5 years 2003: 6 years.
The Companys cash balances of 25,481,000 2003: 1,278,000 earn interest calculated by reference to LIBOR.
All of the Companys assets are denominated in Sterling.
Financial liabilities All of the Companys financial liabilities of 74,862,000 2003: 74,706,000 are denominated in Sterling.
All 7 current liabilities have no interest rate, and are repayable within one year.
The 9 8% debenture stock and the 5.5% debenture stock, which are repayable in 2017 and 2021 respectively, pay interest at fixed rates.
The weighted average period until maturity of the debenture stocks is 15 years 2003: 16 years and the weighted average interest rate payable is 7.2% 2003: 7.2% per annum.
The Company also has recourse to a 7.5m overdraft facility with HSBC Bank with interest charged by reference to LIBOR.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All of the financial assets and liabilities of the Company are held at fair value except for the debenture stocks whose fair values based on the market prices of the respective stocks on 31 December 2004 were as follows: Fair Fair market value Difference market value Difference 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December Book value 2004 2004 2003 2003 000 000 000 000 000 7 9 8% debenture stock 25,000 33,951 8,951 33,078 8,078 5.5% debenture stock 38,000 36,809 1,191 34,296 3,074 63,000 70,760 7,760 68,004 5,004 TEMPLE BAR INVESTMENT TRUST 36
