Statement of Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and of the group and of the profit and loss and cash flows of the group for that period.
In preparing these accounts, the directors are required to adopt suitable accounting policies and to apply them consistently, making judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent, and following applicable accounting standards.
The directors are responsible for ensuring that the company keeps proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and the group and taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The maintenance and integrity of the Rentokil Initial plc website is the responsibility of the directors: the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
