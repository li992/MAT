Unaudited pro forma IFRS information continued Notes continued Revenue recognition and impairment in Yes Car Credit Under UK GAAP, the proceeds from a vehicle sale are recognised immediately, together with a proportion of the insurance commission income.
The remainder of the insurance commission is recognised on a straight line basis over the life of the finance contract.
Finance income is recognised over the life of the contract to give a constant rate of return on the carrying amount.
Under IFRS, the car sale continues to be recognised immediately and finance income is recognised using the EIR.
Insurance commissions are taken into account in calculating the EIR and are, therefore, spread over the life of the contract albeit not on a straight line basis like UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, bad debt provisions in Yes Car Credit reflect the directors best estimate of the number of contracts likely to default and the average expected loss for these contracts.
Under IFRS, impairment is recognised when there is objective evidence that a loan is impaired i. e. when a contractual payment has been missed.
Provisions are calculated using the expected cash flows of impaired loans and discounted at the EIR.
Revenue recognition and impairment in Vanquis Bank Under UK GAAP, annual fees are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Under IFRS, annual fees have to be taken into account in calculating the EIR.
There is no material change in the bad debt provisioning policy of Vanquis Bank on transition to IFRS.
3 Under UK GAAP, goodwill is recorded at cost and amortised to the profit and loss account over its expected useful economic life.
Goodwill amortisation is prohibited under IFRS.
Instead, annual impairment reviews of goodwill should be conducted and any impairment should be reflected in the profit and loss account.
IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards allows UK GAAP goodwill as at the date of transition to be frozen and then subject to a formal annual impairment review.
The groups date of transition to IFRS is 1 January 2004 and the adjustment set out in the pro forma therefore reflects the reversal of the UK GAAP goodwill amortisation charge in 2004 of 4.6m.
4 Under UK GAAP, the group currently uses SSAP 24 to account for pension obligations.
Under SSAP 24, the annual charge to the profit and loss account reflects the total cost of providing pensions including actuarial gains and losses spread over the working lives of employees.
Differences between cash contributions made to the scheme and the pension charge in the profit and loss account are held on balance sheet.
The IFRS standard on pensions is IAS 19 Employee Benefits.
IAS 19 is broadly comparable to FRS 17 which, under its transitional arrangements, has historically been a disclosure only standard see note 27 to the accounts for the disclosures in respect of FRS 17.
Both standards are balance sheet focussed with pension deficits surpluses recognised on balance sheet.
There are a number of alternative treatments of actuarial gains and losses under IAS 19 the group intends to reflect such gains and losses in a statement of recognised income and expense which is now allowed under IAS 19 and is comparable to FRS 17.
The profit and loss account adjustment is the difference between the UK GAAP SSAP 24 charge 10.7m and the IAS 19 charge 9.2m.
The net asset adjustment represents the reversal of the UK GAAP pension prepayment of 35.7m and full reflection of the pension deficit under IFRS 129.8m.
The IAS 19 deficit is 1.6m greater than the FRS 17 deficit of 128.2m due to small differences between the two standards in the valuation of scheme assets and the treatment of risk benefits i. e. lump sums and dependants pensions payable on death in service.
The deferred tax asset on the pension deficit has been reflected separately from the pension deficit as, unlike FRS 17, IFRS does not allow an offset to be made.
5 Under UK GAAP, the excess of the intrinsic value market value of the share at date of grant over the exercise price of options is charged to the profit and loss account over the employee performance period.
SAYE schemes are exempt from this treatment under UK GAAP.
IFRS 2 Share Based Payments requires a fair value based method of accounting for share based payments which takes into account the value of the option and not just the market price of the share on date of grant.
The cost of share based payments is recognised over the relevant vesting period which is broadly comparable with UK GAAP.
There is no exemption in IFRS for SAYE schemes.
The adjustment in the pro forma represents the recognition of a profit and loss account charge for share based payments under IFRS.
As permitted by IFRS 2, the adjustment has been calculated based on all share options and SAYE schemes granted since 7 November 2002 but which have not vested by 1 January 2004.
There is minimal net asset impact as the charge to the profit and loss account is offset by the creation of a corresponding reserve within equity shareholders funds.
Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 95 Unaudited pro forma IFRS information continued Notes continued 6 Under UK GAAP, derivatives e. g. interest rate swaps, foreign currency contracts are recorded at cost and accounted for on an accruals basis.
Foreign currency loans which are the subject of currency hedging arrangements are retranslated at each period end using the contracted rate.
IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recognised on balance sheet at their fair value.
Movements in fair value should be reflected in the profit and loss account unless prescriptive hedge accounting criteria are met.
The group manages interest rate and foreign exchange risk through the use of derivative financial instruments.
Accordingly, these are reflected on balance sheet at their fair value under IFRS.
The group has attained hedge accounting from 1 January 2004 for the majority of its derivatives and, therefore, for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting, movements in fair value are deferred in a hedging reserve within equity shareholders funds and released to the profit and loss account in line with the underlying hedged item s. The profit and loss account charge under IFRS reflects the movement in fair value of those hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting and any small amounts of hedge ineffectiveness arising on those that do qualify.
In addition to the above, IAS 21 Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchanges Rates requires all monetary assets and liabilities to be retranslated at the year end exchange rate regardless of hedging arrangements in place.
Accordingly, the groups foreign currency borrowings which under UK GAAP are retranslated at the contracted rate of exchange have been retranslated using the year end exchange rate as at 31 December 2004.
The movement in the liability has been offset by movements in the fair value of the cross currency swaps which are in place to hedge the loans.
As a result, there is no impact on the profit and loss account.
7 Under UK GAAP, dividends approved after the balance sheet date are recorded as liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, dividends approved after the balance sheet date cannot be included as a liability at the balance sheet date.
The adjustment in the pro forma reflects the reversal of the 2004 proposed year end dividend in the balance sheet.
The adjustment in the profit and loss account reflects the difference between the 2003 proposed year end dividend now reflected in 2004 and the 2004 proposed year end dividend will be reflected in 2005.
It should be noted that if the presentational aspects of IFRS were being adopted in the pro forma, dividends would not appear in the profit and loss account but would instead be included in a statement of changes in shareholders equity.
8 The adoption of IAS 39 in the 2004 comparative results is optional on first time transition to IFRS in 2005.
Given that IAS 39 impacts revenue recognition, impairment bad debt provisioning and recognition of derivatives at fair value, the group intends to fully adopt IAS 39 in its 2004 comparatives to ensure that they are comparable with the 2005 results.
9 At present, there is no material impact on the UK GAAP accounting policies of the insurance division following the transition to IFRS.
The IASB recently introduced IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts which is primarily a disclosure only standard, and represents the first phase of the project to review insurance accounting under IFRS.
The group will continue to monitor the IASBs review of insurance accounting as it continues to develop.

4 Tax on capital gains 4.1 For the purposes of tax on capital gains, the price of an ordinary share in the company on 31 March 1982 was 130.50p.
When adjusted for the 1 for 5 scrip issue in 1986, the 5 for 2 share split in 1993, the 1 for 1 bonus issue in 1996 and the share capital consolidation in 1998, this gives a figure of 22.54p.
4.2 Shareholders for whom the price of ordinary shares at 31 March 1982 is relevant should note that their allowable expenditure in relation to future disposals of ordinary shares may also be affected by other factors, such as indexation and or the disposal of fractional entitlements pursuant to the share capital consolidation of the company in April 1998.
Tax on dividends 5 5.1 A UK resident individual shareholder who receives a dividend is entitled to a tax credit in respect of the dividend.
1 5.2 The tax credit is 9th of the dividend corresponding to 10% of the dividend and the associated tax credit.
5.3 A UK resident individual shareholder is therefore treated as having paid tax at 10% on the aggregate of the dividend and the associated tax credit: as starting, lower and basic rate taxpayers are liable to tax on the dividend and associated tax credit at 10%, they will have no further liability to tax in respect of the dividend.
UK resident individuals cannot claim a refund of the 10% tax credit.
5.4 The tax liability on dividends for UK resident higher rate taxpayers is 32.5% on the aggregate of the dividend and the associated tax credit, so that their liability for additional tax is equal to 22.5% on the aggregate of the dividend and the associated tax credit.
5.5 Arrangements can be made for a shareholders dividends to be paid directly into a nominated bank account.
