The principal differences are set out below.
profit or loss on disposal of businesses Unilever calculates profit or loss on sale of businesses after writing back any goodwill previously written off directly to reserves as a movement in profit retained.
Under US GAAP the profit or loss on disposal of the businesses is stated net of the relevant unamortised goodwill included on the balance sheet and the cumulative currency retranslation differences recognised through the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under UK GAAP, gains on the partial disposal of group companies involving non-monetary consideration are recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, these gains are recorded in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill and intangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill being the difference between the fair value of consideration paid for new interests in group companies, joint ventures and associated companies and the fair value of the Groups share of their net assets at the date of acquisition and identiable intangible assets purchased after 1 January 1998 are capitalised and amortised in operating profit over the period of their expected useful life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Periods in excess of five years are used only where the Directors are satisfied that the life of these assets will clearly exceed that period.
Goodwill and intangible assets purchased prior to 1 January 1998 were written off in the year of acquisition as a movement in profits retained.
On disposal of a business acquired prior to 1 January 1998, purchased goodwill written off on acquisition is reinstated in arriving at the profit or loss on disposal.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, purchased goodwill and identiable intangible assets were capitalised and amortised over their useful lives.
From 1 January 2002, under SFAS 142, the amortisation of goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives ceased.
Intangible assets that have nite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful lives.
Goodwill and identiable intangible assets that have indefinite lives are assessed annually for impairment.

b Under UK GAAP, goodwill and intangible assets purchased prior to 1 January 1998 were written off in the year of acquisition as a movement in profits retained.
Under US GAAP, such goodwill and intangible assets were capitalised and, prior to 1 January 2002, were amortised over their useful lives.
These different accounting treatments give rise to differences between net profit calculated under UK GAAP and net profit calculated under US GAAP, both in respect of amortisation recorded for US GAAP purposes prior to 1 January 2002, and in respect of the calculation of profit and loss on disposal of a business.
Similar differences arise in the calculation of capital and reserves under UK and US GAAP.
c The detailed rules for measuring impairment differ between UK and US GAAP, resulting in differing gures for impairment recognised as calculated under UK and US GAAP.
d The detailed rules for determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired as part of the acquisition of a business differ between UK and US GAAP.
These differences give rise to differing gures for goodwill arising on acquisition as calculated under UK and US GAAP.
e The 2004 US GAAP reconciliation includes an adjustment to goodwill of 1 120 million and deferred taxes to record a deferred tax liability of 1 002 million relating to intangible assets recognised as part of the Bestfoods acquisition.
The impact of this adjustment on prior years is not significant and therefore the adjustment has been included in the current year.
During 2004 we reviewed the balances relating to the global Slim Fast business in light of the significant decline in the weight management category in North America during the second half of the year.
Over the last few years, consumer tastes in this category have changed frequently, featuring low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, low-salt, low-sugar and other products.
The business declined in 2004 but maintained leadership of the category by refreshing its product range and offering a broader diet plan.
The impairment review determined the value in use using a discounted cash ow methodology for a period of 10 years.
The projections covered 10 years as management considers that this period more fairly reects the long-term value in this highly dynamic category.
The discount rate used was based on a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital and was 11%.
As a result of the impairment review, the carrying value of the business was determined to be in excess of the value in use, thereby requiring an impairment loss to be measured by a comparison of the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value.
This evaluation yielded a goodwill impairment charge of 916 million.
The impairment charge is 325 million higher than that recognised under UK GAAP because goodwill amortisation has not been charged on the underlying assets against which the business valuation is compared and because of a difference in the methodology of measuring the goodwill impairment charge under US GAAP.
This has been reected wholly within the Beverages category.
