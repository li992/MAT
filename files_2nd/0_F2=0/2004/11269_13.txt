The policy is to ensure that forecast net borrowings plus a reasonable operating headroom are covered by committed facilities which mature at least 12 months after the year end.
At the year end 190.0m 2003: 260.0m remained undrawn on the revolving credit facility.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities at the year end was as follows: Group Group Company Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m In one year or less, or on demand 19.5 58.4 31.9 57.6 In more than one year but not more than two years 12.2 16.6 12.2 16.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 350.6 202.2 350.6 202.2 In more than five years 90.5 90.5 Total borrowings 382.3 367.7 394.7 366.3 Further details of the groups facilities are set out in note 21.
Interest rate risk The group manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings by operating with a mix of fixed and floating rate borrowings.
The objective for the mix of fixed and floating rate is to operate with fixed rate borrowings within a range of 20 to 50 per cent of total borrowings over the medium term, although the group may operate outside of that range during the year.
The groups fixed rate debt is based principally on the 91.28m 6.75 per cent convertible subordinated bonds 2008 detailed in note 21.
The group does not use derivatives for interest rate management.

The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts by reference to market exchange rates at the year end was a gain of 1.3m 2003: cost of 1.7m.
The book value of other financial assets and liabilities approximates to fair value due to their short maturities.
Currency exposure The group operates primarily in the UK with only approximately 13.7 per cent of sales arising from companies operating in currencies other than sterling, giving rise to an exposure to the euro.
The average and closing rates used in the accounts to translate euro to sterling were 1.440 1 and 1.5074 1 respectively 2003: 1.559 1 and 1.4581 1.

Revolving credit facility 2006 The five year syndicated revolving credit facility for 450m was entered into in September 2001.
At the year end borrowings under this facility were 260.0m.
These borrowings are repayable in periods of up to one year but are capable of being immediately refinanced as part of the committed revolving credit facility.
Loan notes During the year the group issued loan notes of 2.0m in respect of the acquisition of Solway Foods Holdings Limited which bear interest at 1 per cent below the base rate.
They can be redeemed in amounts of 20,000 or multiples thereof at their nominal principal amount semi-annually on 30 June and 31 December each year.
Loan notes not previously redeemed will be redeemed at their nominal amount by 30 June 2008.

The assets of the Scheme are held in trustee administered funds separate from the finances of the group.
SSAP 24 The pension cost relating to the Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit method.
For the purposes of determining pension costs the most significant assumptions adopted were as follows: Rate of increase in pensionable earnings 3.9 per cent per annum Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.8 per cent per annum Rate of investment return 7.3 per cent per annum The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2002 using a market-based approach.
The market value of the Schemes assets was 449.9m which represented 95 per cent of the value of accrued benefits allowing for assumed future increases in earnings on the basis of the assumptions adopted for that valuation.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the accounts in respect of the groups pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 31 March 2002.
This does not take into account any impact of the fall in general stock markets since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next triennial valuation, based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until adoption of FRS 17.
The contribution rate for the year was 12.7 per cent of pensionable earnings and the agreed contribution rate for the next year is 12.7 per cent of pensionable earnings.
FRS 17 Additional disclosure regarding the groups defined benefit schemes is required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at the year end by an independent, qualified actuary, Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
For the purposes of determining the Scheme liabilities under FRS 17 the most significant assumptions adopted were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Rate of increase of salaries 3.9 3.6 3.9 Rate of increase to pensions in payment 2.8 2.5 2.8 Rate of increase to deferred pensions 3.0 3.0 3.0 Discount rate 5.5 5.9 6.3 Inflation assumption 2.9 2.6 2.9 The fair value of the assets in the Scheme, together with those of the overseas schemes, the present value of the liabilities and the expected rate of return as at the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Long term Long term Long term expected rate expected rate expected rate of return 2004 of return 2003 of return 2002 %m %m %m Equities 8.3 374.4 8.3 264.7 8.3 370.6 Bonds 5.0 103.0 5.0 103.7 6.0 100.0 Other 4.0 6.0 4.0 29.0 5.0 3.1 Total fair value of assets 483.4 397.4 473.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 705.1 600.9 540.9 Deficit in scheme 221.7 203.5 67.2 Related deferred tax asset 66.0 60.0 20.2 Net pension deficit 155.7 143.5 47.0 Northern Foods plc Notes to the accounts 45 Notes to the accounts continued 25 Pensions continued If the group had adopted FRS 17, the groups profit and loss account reserve would have been restated as follows: 2004 2003 m m Group profit and loss account reserve excluding pension deficit 149.6 148.2 Pension deficit 155.7 143.5 SSAP 24 prepayment 61.3 47.4 Deferred tax on SSAP 24 prepayment 18.4 14.1 Group profit and loss account reserve 49.0 28.6 The amounts charged to operating profit under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2004 2003 m m Current service cost 18.7 20.4 Net operating charge 18.7 20.4 The amounts charged credited to net finance income under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2004 2003 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 28.3 37.3 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 34.8 34.3 Net finance income 6.5 3.0 The amounts included within the groups statement of total recognised gains and losses under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2004 2003 m m Difference between actual and expected return on scheme assets 51.9 127.9 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 0.5 7.0 Effects of changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 74.5 23.0 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in groups statement of total recognised gains and losses 22.1 143.9 Deferred tax movement 6.6 42.3 Total actuarial gains and losses recognised in groups statement of total recognised gains and losses net of deferred tax 15.5 101.6 The movement in deficit during the year under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2004 2003 m m Deficit in scheme at start of year 203.5 67.2 Movement in year: Disposal of scheme 4.3 Current service cost 18.7 20.4 Contributions 24.7 25.4 Other finance income 6.5 3.0 Exchange adjustments 0.1 0.4 Actuarial loss 22.1 143.9 Deficit in scheme at end of year 221.7 203.5 Related deferred tax asset 66.0 60.0 Net pension deficit at end of year 155.7 143.5 46 Notes to the accounts Northern Foods plc 25 Pensions continued The experience gains and losses under FRS 17 would have been as follows: 2004 2003 Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 51.9 127.9 Percentage of scheme assets % 10.7 32.2 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 0.5 7.0 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities % 0.1 1.2 Total actuarial gain or loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount m 22.1 143.9 Percentage of the present value of scheme liabilities % 3.1 23.9 26 Financial commitments Capital expenditure authorised by the directors and to which the group and the company are contracted amounts to 4.7m 2003: 1.0m for the group and nil 2003: nil for the company.
