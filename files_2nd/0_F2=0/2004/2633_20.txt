notes to the financial statements year ended 31 December 2004 1.
Accounting policies The accounting policies, which have been applied consistently in the current and preceding year, are set out below: a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modied to include the revaluation of certain xed assets, in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
b Oil and gas industry accounting standards In addition to the requirements of United Kingdom accounting standards, the accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities is guided by the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development Production and Decommissioning Activities, issued by the UK Oil Industry Accounting Committee.
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the SORP, with the exception that the accounting policy adopted for oil and gas underlift is not in compliance with the SORP for the reason set out in note 1 h below.
c Reporting currency The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, although the Company and the majority of its subsidiaries have a US dollar functional currency.
The balance sheet at 31 December 2004, including all items of shareholders equity other than the profit and loss reserve, has been translated at the closing rate of $1.91589 1 31 December 2003: $1.78578 and the profit and loss account for the year then ended at the average rate for the year then ended of $1.83559 1 2003: $1.64415.
All resulting exchange differences are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
d Basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the results of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date at which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method, under which purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
e Oil and gas properties The Group follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties under which expenditure on pre-licence, licence acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development activities is capitalised.
All capitalised exploration and development expenditure is recorded within an appropriate cost pool within tangible xed assets, except that certain exploration and appraisal costs may be held outside a cost pool, pending determination of commercial reserves, within intangible xed assets.
The Group has three cost pools: the Caspian Region, West Africa and North Africa.
The Groups denition of commercial reserves is proven and probable reserves.
Pre-licence acquisition, exploration and appraisal costs of individual licence interests held outside a cost pool remain undepreciated pending determination subject to there being no evidence of impairment.
When a decision to develop an oil and gas property has been taken, or if there is evidence of impairment in value, the costs are transferred to the appropriate cost pool within tangible xed assets.
Costs carried within each pool are depreciated on a unit of production basis using the ratio of oil and gas production in the period to the estimated quantity of commercial reserves at the end of the period plus production in the period.
Costs in the unit of production calculation include the net book value of capitalised costs plus estimated future development costs.
Changes in estimates of commercial reserves or future development costs are dealt with prospectively.
When events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of expenditure within a cost pool may not be recoverable from future net revenues from oil and gas reserves attributable to that pool, a comparison between the net book value of the cost pool and the discounted future cash ows from that cost pool is undertaken.
To the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount, the pool is written down to its recoverable amount and charged as additional depreciation.
f Decommissioning Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a eld exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised.
The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
A tangible xed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created and depreciated on a unit of production basis.
Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated xed asset.
There were no material decommissioning liabilities at 31 December 2003 and 2004. g Other tangible fixed assets Other tangible xed assets are stated at cost less depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment: 4 years Ofce furniture: 4 years Barges and tugs: 20 years The carrying values of other tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
h Oil and gas overlift and underlift Underlifts of entitlement to crude oil production are recorded at the lower of production cost and market value, whereas overlifts are recorded at market value.
This is not in accordance with the SORP which recommends the use of market value for measuring overlift and underlift.
The Group has adopted this policy because management believes it more fairly reects the Groups results.
The Group had no underlifts at 31 December 2004.
BURREN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 41 notes to the financial statements continued year ended 31 December 2004 1.
Accounting policies continued i Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
j Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless conversion actually occurs.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of the debt instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
k Revenue recognition Oil sales revenue represents amounts invoiced exclusive of sales related taxes for the Groups share of oil sales in the year.
l Shipping repairs and renewals Ships are dry-docked periodically and the costs are expensed as incurred.
Other maintenance costs are carried out and expensed as incurred.
m Foreign currencies Company Transactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded in US dollars at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than US dollars are re-translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses on foreign currency translation are included in the profit and loss account.
Group The financial statements of subsidiary undertakings that do not use US dollars as a functional currency are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The exchange difference arising on the re-translation of opening net assets is taken directly to reserves.
All other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account for the year.
n Leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as tangible xed assets and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
o Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more or a right to pay less tax, with the following exceptions: no provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
p Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward crude oil sales contracts, swaps and options to reduce exposure to uctuations in the price of crude oil.
Contracts are only entered into to hedge physical positions related to the Groups crude oil production and are, accordingly, accounted for as hedge transactions.
The gain or loss arising on these instruments is deferred and recognised only when the hedged transaction occurs.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
q Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
r Revaluation reserve In accordance with the SORP the Group records any fair value uplift on acquisition of exploration and production subsidiaries within the related xed asset cost pool, with the related balance being transferred to a revaluation reserve.
Where depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are increased following such a fair value uplift, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account as a movement on reserves.
