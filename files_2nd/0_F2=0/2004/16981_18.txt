Tax continued c Factors affecting current tax charge The tax assessed on the profit on ordinary activities for the year is less than the weighted average of standard rates of corporation tax across the Group of 30.7% 2003: 31.2%.
The differences are reconciled below.

These assets will be recovered when future tax charges are sufficient to absorb the reversal of these tax benets.
Deferred tax asset balances for capital losses in the UK amounting to 13,593,000 2003: 13,158,000 have not been recognised but would be available in the event of future capital gains being incurred by the Group.
No provision has been made for the liability to tax from capital gains amounting to 80,000 2003: 78,000 which would arise if land and buildings were to be sold at their book amounts.
No provision has been made for any taxation which might arise on the distribution to the UK of retained overseas earnings of 192,241,000 2003: 194,702,000. e Balance sheet deferred tax Group Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Included in debtors note 12 2,775 2,183 654 1,026 Included in provisions for liabilities & charges note 17 17,418 17,533 Included in retirement benets note 18 29,038 32,747 302 282 14,395 17,397 956 1,308 Accelerated capital allowances 902 1,522 4 2 Other timing differences 13,741 13,828 658 1,024 Retirement benets 29,038 32,747 302 282 14,395 17,397 956 1,308 At 27 December 2003 17,397 1,308 profit & loss account 2,681 374 Statement of total recognised gains & losses 967 22 Exchange 646 At 31 December 2004 14,395 956 50 The Weir Group PLC Report and Accounts 2004 5.

Retirement benets The Group operates dened benefit pension arrangements in the UK and North America of which The Weir Group Pension & Retirement Savings Scheme is predominant.
The latest full actuarial assessment of this plan was at 31 December 2002, and, for the purposes of accounting for FRS17, this has been adjusted to reect the positions at the 2003 and 2004 year ends by a qualied independent actuary.
For this closed scheme, the current service cost is expected to increase under the projected unit method as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Resulting from the latest full actuarial assessment, on the advice of the actuary, the employer contribution rate increased from 10.5% to 12.5% of total contribution salaries with effect from 1 April 2003 and further contributions of 10m and 8m were made in the first half of 2003 and the first half of 2004 respectively.
It is intended that the next full actuarial assessment of this plan for funding purposes will take place as at 31 December 2005.

Derivatives & other financial instruments continued b Exchange risk management The Group follows a policy of managing its exposure to foreign currencies by hedging all significant transaction exposures using the forward forex markets whenever possible.
In addition, foreign currency monetary assets are utilised to manage currency exposure on future monetary liabilities arising in respect of existing contracts.
The currency gains losses on these monetary assets are matched against the exposure on the future monetary liability in the overall contract assessment.
Accordingly, as at 31 December 2004 and at 26 December 2003, there are no material exposures on currency transactions that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
