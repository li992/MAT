iii Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives.
The estimate has been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date.
The timing of decommissioning payments are dependent on the lives of the facilities but are anticipated to occur between 2005 and 2042.
The profit and loss charge includes 9 million of notional interest 2003: 6 million.
iv The provision for tax on gas and oil activities has been calculated on a unit of production basis.
v This provision included the difference between charges to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the pension schemes in respect of retirement pensions and other related benefits see note 26.
In addition, cash contributions of 3 million have been paid to the pension schemes which had been provided for within the restructuring provision see footnote vi below.
The pension asset of 83 million at 31 December 2004 has been transferred to prepayments see note 15. vi The provision represents costs relating to surplus properties, redundancy and other costs relating to reorganisations.
The provision relating to surplus properties was calculated as the lower of the difference between rental costs and sub-let income over the remainder of the leases and the expected cost to surrender those leases.
The profit and loss charge for the year included 105 million for exceptional redundancy and other reorganisation costs see note 5.
The majority of these sums are expected to be spent in 2005.
Included within the utilisation for 2004 are additional contributions to the pension scheme of 3 million in respect of redundancy costs.
