Supply We have some 15,000 people at 30 manufacturing sites in 20 countries, dedicated to ensuring that we can deliver a secure, high quality, cost-effective supply of our product range worldwide.
With a few temporary exceptions, major products and line extensions were successfully supported with supplies available to meet market demand.
These included the continued global roll-out of Crestor, the European launches of Exanta and the completion in all major markets of the launch of the Zoladex Safesystem, designed to protect against needlestick injuries when handling the injectable Zoladex therapy.
Managing costs is an ongoing priority.
2004 saw the continued implementation across our global network of our new supply system, which is delivering manufacturing efficiency benefits such as shortened lead times and improved customer service levels.
We continue to invest for the future.
Our expenditure on supply and manufacturing facilities totalled $352 million in 2004 and new facilities authorised included formulation capacity for Symbicort in France, for Pulmicort in the US and for Nexium in Sweden.
We also continuously review our existing manufacturing assets to make sure they are being used most effectively, whilst preserving the flexibility we need to respond to fluctuations in demand.
During 2004, we sold our facility in Karlskoga, Sweden.
