11 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding own shares held in the employee share trusts which have been treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share adjusts for share options granted to employees and warrants where the exercise price is less than the average price of the Companys ordinary shares during the period.
Diluted earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill have also been calculated since, in the opinion of the directors, this is a more representative indicator of the trading performance of the Group.
Earnings per share are calculated as follows: 12 months to December 2004 8 months to December 2003 Weighted Weighted average average number Earnings number Earnings Earnings of shares per share Earnings of shares per share m million pence m million pence Basic 40 891.0 4.5 27 879.1 3.1 Dilution impact of options 1.6 0.2 Diluted 40 892.6 4.5 27 879.3 3.1 Exclude exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill 230 25.7 217 24.6 Diluted excluding exceptionals and amortisation of goodwill 270 892.6 30.2 244 879.3 27.7 12 Intangible assets Goodwill Brands Total m m m Cost At 31 December 2003 2,414 445 2,859 Businesses acquired 39 39 Exchange adjustments 18 4 22 At 31 December 2004 2,471 449 2,920 Amortisation At 31 December 2003 196 196 Provided during the year 118 118 Exchange adjustments 5 5 At 31 December 2004 319 319 Net book value at 31 December 2003 2,218 445 2,663 Net book value at 31 December 2004 2,152 449 2,601 The Kronenbourg brand was initially recognised at its fair value on acquisition in 2002.
The brand has a long history in a long established industry and has a significant share in the European beer market.
These factors, together with the scale of the business, contribute to the brands durability.
Consequently, the useful life of the brand is considered by the directors to be indefinite and no annual amortisation is provided.
The carrying value of the brand is subject to an annual impairment review.

The interest rate, terms of loan and supply terms for beer purchases are all inter-related and vary among customers.
The benefit of trade loans should, therefore, not be viewed solely in terms of interest rates.

As described in iii above trade loans are linked to customer terms of trade for the supply of beer.
The fair value of trade loans cannot be viewed solely in terms of interest rates and the fair value is considered to be in line with the book value.
The fair values of other items have been calculated by discounting expected future cash ows at prevailing interest rates.
Currency swaps are used to manage the currency exposure of short and long term borrowings and the fair values of these swaps are recognised in the balance sheet in the book value of short and long term borrowings.
