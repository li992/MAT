Notes to the accounts YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED G HEDGES The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk within approved board policies and guidelines.
Interest rate swaps, interest rate caps and collars and forward rate agreements are used to manage interest rate exposure under a policy that requires between 80% and 95% of Yorkshire Water Services Limiteds net debt and 60% and 85% of Kelda Group plcs net debt to be held at fixed rates.
At the financial year end the proportions were 89% and 75% respectively.
Gains and losses on hedges are not recognised until the interest payment that is being hedged is itself recognised.

25 PENSIONS UK PENSION SCHEME The group sponsors a UK pension scheme, called the Kelda Group Pension Plan KGPP.
The KGPP has a number of benefit categories providing benefits on a defined benefit basis and one category providing benefits on a defined contribution basis.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the KGPP was carried out as at 31 March 2001 when the market value of assets was 559.9m and the scheme surplus 22.2m.
The UK pension cost under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs for KGPP has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, using the projected unit method.
For this purpose, the actuarial assumptions adopted are based upon investment growth of 5.4% per annum, pay growth of 4% per annum and increases to pensions in payment and deferred pensions of 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the assets represented 107.5% of the value of the accrued benefits after allowing for expected future earnings increases.
In deriving the pension costs under SSAP 24, the surplus is being spread over the future working lifetime of the employees.
Contributions over the year ended 31 March 2004 were paid by members at 3%, 4%, 4.5%, 5% or 6% of pensionable pay depending on benefit category.
The company contributed at 200% of members contributions during the accounting year in respect of the majority of members.
An accrual for unfunded benefits of 2.1m 2003: 1.8m has been included in the groups accounts at 31 March 2004.
US PENSION SCHEME Aquarion in the US operates a number of non contributory defined benefit retirement plans.
The principal retirement plans relate to the Aquarion company, employees of the American Water Works companies and employees of Aquarion Services Company.
Aquarion also provides healthcare benefits for certain categories of employees.
The latest valuations of the US schemes were carried out at 31 December 2003.
The market value of assets of the principal retirement plans was $65.3m 2003: $56.3m representing a deficit of $0.9m 2003: surplus $3.5m over the benefit obligations at that date.
The benefit obligation of the post retirement healthcare plans exceeded the market value of assets by $22.3m 2003: $19.7m.
The Aquarion pension assets and liabilities have been recorded at fair value on acquisition and full provision for the post retirement healthcare benefit obligations has been made in the groups accounts at 31 March 2004.
The groups total pension charge for the year was 13.3m 2003: 11.2m.
65 KELDA GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the accounts YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 25 PENSIONS CONTINUED The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 are set out below.
A qualified independent actuary has updated the most recent valuations of the principal schemes to 31 March 2004.
In calculating the liabilities at 31 March 2004, the following financial assumptions have been used: 20042004 2003 2003 UKUSUK US MAJOR ASSUMPTIONS%% %% Inflation2.62.5 Rate of increase in salaries3.84.0 3.7 4.0 Rate of increase to pensions in payment and deferred pensions2.62.5 2.5 Discount rate for scheme liabilities5.55.8 5.4 6.3 The rate of increase in healthcare costs in the US varies by year of projection with an ultimate rate of 5% from 2008.
Pension increases in the US apply only to certain members of the Aquarion Services Company Pension Plan.
The market values of the assets and the FRS 17 value of liabilities of KGPP and the principal US defined benefit plans at 31 March 2004, together with the expected long term rate of returns were as follows: 2004 UK US EXPECTED LONG EXPECTED LONG MARKET TERM RATE OFMARKET TERM RATE OF LUERETURNLUERETURN m %m % Market value of assets Equities426.0 7.3525.7 7.50 Bonds60.3 5.0014.4 5.80 Other14.0 4.602.1 4.75 500.342.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 587.0 60.5 Pension deficit before deferred tax 86.7 18.3 Deferred tax26.07.3 NET PENSION DEFICIT 60.7 11.0 2003 UK US EXPECTED LONG EXPECTED LONG MARKET TERM RATE OFMARKET TERM RATE OF LUERETURNLUERETURN m %m % Market value of assets Equities314.7 7.2520.0 7.75 Bonds69.8 4.9016.9 6.30 Other22.6 4.503.3 5.00 407.140.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 566.9 57.4 Pension deficit before deferred tax 159.8 17.2 Deferred tax47.96.9 NET PENSION DEFICIT 111.9 10.3 FRS 17 requires that the pension schemes are valued using market conditions at the companys year end.
This produces a volatile figure for any surplus or deficit as it is largely dependent on the levels of stock markets for one particular date.
The groups pension liabilities are funded on a long term basis based on the periodic actuarial reviews rather than the FRS 17 disclosures.
