TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 APRIL 2004 1 Statement of accounting policies The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed assets, and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be given.
The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and on the basis that all activities are continuing.
The Statement of Recommended Practice January 2003 on the form and content of the financial statements of investment trust companies has been followed in the preparation of the Financial Statements.
A summary of the more important accounting policies which have been consistently applied is given below.
a Investment income and interest Dividends on investments are credited to the revenue account when they are quoted ex-dividend or as soon as entitlement has been established, if later.
Interest receivable on loans, short-term deposits and fixed income securities is accounted for on a time-apportioned basis so as to reflect the effective yield.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than in cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
b Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis and are charged through the revenue account except where they directly relate to the acquisition or disposal of an investment, in which case they are added to the cost of investment or deducted from the sales proceeds.
c Taxation The payment of taxation is deferred or accelerated because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Full provision for deferred taxation is madeunder the liability method, without discounting, on all timing differences that have arisen, but not reversed by thebalancesheetdate, unlesssuch  byFinancial Reporting Standard 19. d Investments i Securities which are listed on a stock exchange or traded on any other organised market are valued at the last available price on such exchange or market which is normally the principle market for each security, and these securities dealt in on an over-the-counter market are valued in a manner as near as possible to that for quoted securities.
ii Securities not listed on any stock exchange nor traded on any organised market are valued at the last available price, or if such price is not representative of their fair value, they are valued prudently and in good faith on the basis of their reasonably foreseeable sale prices.
e Foreign currencies Transactions involving foreign currencies are translated at the spot exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the last day of the financial year.
Currency gains and losses are credited or charged to capital and revenue reserves dependent on the nature of the transaction giving rise to the gain or loss.
f Capital reserve realised The following are accounted for in this reserve: gains and losses on the realisation of investments realised exchange differences of a capital nature.
Capital reserve unrealised The following are accounted for in this reserve: increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature.

51 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 25 Derivatives and other financial instruments In pursuing the investment objectives set out on the inside cover of this Report the Company holds a number of financial instruments.
These comprise: Equity and non-equity shares.
These are held in accordance with the Companys investment objectives and policies: Cash and liquid resources that arise directly from its operations: and Shareholders funds, representing investors monies, which are invested on their behalf.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price, foreign currency and liquidity risks.
The Investment Manager reviews policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the year to which these financial statements relate.
Market price risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainties about future prices of financial instruments held.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
The Directors regularly consider the asset allocation of the portfolio in order to minimise the risk associated with particular countries or industry sectors whilst continuing to follow the investment objectives.
The Investment Manager has responsibility for monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet the risk reward profile that is acceptable.
The Investment Manager does not use derivative instruments to hedge the investment portfolio against market risk, as in its opinion, the cost of such a process would result in an unacceptable reduction in the potential for capital growth.
Foreign currency risk Currency translation movements can significantly affect the income and capital value of the Companys investments as the majority of the Companys assets and income are denominated in currencies other than Sterling, which is the Companys functional currency.
The Investment Manager has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could affect the Company: movements in rates affect the value of investments: movements in rates affect short-term timing differences: and movements in rates affect the income received.
The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments that are priced in other currencies.
The Company may be subject to short-term exposure to exchange rate movements, for instance where there is a difference between the date an investment purchase or sale is entered into and the date on which it is settled.
The Company receives income in currencies other than sterling and the sterling values of this income can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Company converts all receipts of income into sterling on or near the date of receipt: it, however, does not hedge or otherwise seek to avoid rate movement risk on income accrued but not received.
52 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 25 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Interest rate risk The Company invests in fixed rate securities.
Any change to the interest rates relevant to particular securities may result in either income increasing or decreasing, or the Manager being unable to secure similar returns on the expiry of contracts or the sale of securities.
In addition, changes to prevailing rates or changes in expectations of future rates may result in an increase or decrease in the value of the securities held.
In general, if interest rates rise the income potential of the Company also rises, but the value of fixed rate securities will decline.
A decline in interest rates will have the opposite effect.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly securities which can be readily realised.
Other risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver the investment purchase or cash sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The Company only buys and sells through brokers which have been approved by the Investment Manager as an acceptable counter-party.
In addition, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any individual broker that may exist at any time.
These limits are reviewed regularly.
Currency exposures A substantial portion of the net assets of the Company is denominated in currencies other than sterling, with the effect that the balance sheet and total return can be significantly affected by currency movements.
The Companys net monetary assets liabilities, excluding equity investments, are as follows: 2004 2003 Net foreign currency Net foreign currency monetary assets monetary assets Currency 000 000 Argentine peso 50 50 Brazilian real 7 Czech koruna 719 695 Hong Kong dollar 984 1,296 Indian rupee 2,897 Japanese yen 5 Korean won 5,155 8,991 Malaysian ringgit 995 Mexican peso 430 New Taiwan dollar 320 1,237 Philippine peso 38 41 Singapore dollar 218 South African rand 5,068 Thailand baht 611 236 Turkish lira 2,213 9 United States dollar 1,053 2,237 AA 7,997 5,664 AA 53 TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS INVESTMENT TRUST PLC NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS continued 25 Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Interest rate risk profile The majority of the Companys financial assets are non-interest bearing equity investments whose currency profile is not materially different to that shown on the geographic analysis on pages 16 to 19.
Fixed interest financial assets are denominated in sterling and are valued at Nil at 30 April 2004 2003: Nil.
Floating rate financial assets are the cash balances and short term debtors and creditors disclosed in the currency exposure note above, which earn or are charged interest at prevailing current account rates.
Floating rate financial assets denominated in sterling are valued at Nil at 30 April 2004 2003: Nil.
Maturity of financial liabilities The Company has no financial liabilities other than short-term trade creditors and accruals as disclosed in the net currency exposure table above.
Fair Value of financial assets and financial liabilities All of the financial assets of the Company are held at fair value.
There are no financial liabilities except for those identified as creditors in Note 10.
