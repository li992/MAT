a 2 As a result, no single volume of usage can be applied and so no unit cost is derived.
b mm million minutes: ms million seconds: L lines: trans transactions: cust customers: r rooms: ca cables: cct circuits: km kilometres.
f For those components included in core, the floors are distributed long run incremental costs.
For other network components, the floors are long run incremental costs.
g The ceilings are distributed stand alone costs.
g 2 The floor is lower and the ceiling higher than the total cost reported in the statement of costs on a current cost basis due to the existence of common costs between BT Network and the other Businesses.
