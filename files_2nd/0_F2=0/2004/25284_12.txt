Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 January 2004 Accounting policies 1 The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Law and Accounting Standards.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain assets as described below.
b Basis of consolidation The group financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and its principal subsidiaries.
c Revenues and expenses Underwriting fees and other arrangement fees are included in the profit and loss account on the date at which they are receivable.
Amounts receivable at the repayment of a loan which exceed the original cost are taken to the profit and loss account over the full life of the loan.
Such amounts, less tax, are considered to be non-distributable until such time as repayment occurs.
Recurring fees, interest income, interest expense and overheads are accounted for on the accruals basis.
Gains or losses arising on the early termination of financial instruments used for hedging purposes are shown as part of interest expense.
Dividend income is accounted for in the year in which the income is received.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of a loan or an investment is recognised at the date of disposal.
Any gain or loss is stated net of associated selling expenses.
d Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Furniture and Equipment 20%-33% per annum Leasehold Premises Over the term of the lease e Loans and investments held as fixed assets Loans and investments are shown at cost less provisions plus the accrual of amounts receivable at the repayment of a loan which exceed the original cost.
The specific provisioning policy of the company is to make a provision against any loan or investment as and when the directors consider that the carrying value is wholly or partially impaired.
f Loans and investments held as current assets Listed investments which are held as current assets, due to their impending sale, are held at their market value, with any resulting gain or loss being taken to the profit and loss account and included within capital gains.
Loans and non-listed investments held as current assets are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
g Taxation Corporation tax is provided on the taxable profits of the company at the current rate.
h Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences which represent an asset or liability at the balance sheet date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
i Pension costs It is the policy of the company to provide for pension liabilities by payments to insurance companies or to individuals for employees private pension plans.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account represents a percentage of the current payroll cost paid to defined contribution schemes.
j Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions, or where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in related forward exchange contracts.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at that date, or where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in related forward contracts.
Any gain or loss arising from a change of exchange rates subsequent to the dates of the transactions is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account and is included as part of interest expense.
Intermediate Capital Group 31 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 31 January 2004 Accounting policies continued k Value added tax It is the companys policy to write off irrecoverable VAT on items of expenditure relating to the profit and loss account.
VAT on tangible fixed assets is capitalised and written off over a similar period to the asset to which it relates.
l Financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the group are interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts.
The group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the group in line with the groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Termination payments made or received are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist.
In other cases termination payments are taken to the profit and loss account.
Profit of parent company 2 As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The parent companys retained profit for the financial year amounted to 12.9m 2003 5.6m.

Valuation of warrants and unlisted shares 10 The group has warrants to subscribe for shares in a number of borrowers.
These warrants are not marketable instruments and can generally be realised by the group only when the investment is realised.
These warrants, along with unlisted equity shares, are held in the financial statements at nominal cost.
The directors consider that a reasonable valuation of these shares and warrants, representing the groups interests in the equity value of those companies realisable over a period of time, would currently amount to 82m 2003 71m before tax.
This valuation is based on the borrowers current pro forma earnings multiplied by the appropriate price earnings ratio, to which an appropriate discount has been applied.

It is impractical to quantify the effects of this departure.

Financial assets and liabilities 27 Treasury and hedging policies The group's financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings in the form of bank debt and private placements, and various items, such as accrued interest, debtors, trade creditors etc, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the group's operations.
The group also enters into derivatives transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the group's operations and its sources of finance.
The main risks arising from the group's financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
It is the groups policy to match foreign currency loans and related net interest income, wherever possible, through either borrowing in the same foreign currency or entering into equivalent forward foreign exchange contracts.
The groups policy is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements present or future, actual or contingent so as to protect its net interest income over time.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the group's policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the companys flotation in 1994.
Interests and currency exposures Interest rate risk The groups main activity is to provide mezzanine finance to its borrowers at both fixed and floating rates in any freely traded currency.
The group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, private placements and floating rate notes.
The group borrows in currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps in order to match the interest profile of its assets and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
In order to protect its future interest income as its fixed rate assets mature, the company has entered into a series of delayed interest rate swaps under which it receives a fixed rate.
The average rate achieved on these swaps is 6.35%.
As a result, the group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
Intermediate Capital Group 43 Notes to the Accounts continued for the year ended 31 January 2004 Financial Assets & Liabilities continued 27 Liquidity risk As regards liquidity, the group's policy has throughout the year been to ensure continuity of funding.
Due to the long term nature of the groups assets, the groups policy is that, wherever possible, the majority of its debt should mature in more than five years.
This has been achieved by using a combination of private placements with maturities of between five and ten years, by short term borrowings under a five year extendible, multi-currency bank facility and other further syndicated and bilateral facilities and by issuing floating rate notes with a maturity date in 2021.
The maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities, other than short term creditors, is shown in the net debt analysis in note 22 and the analysis of creditors over one year is shown in note 19.
Foreign currency risk Over one half of the portfolio of the group is in currencies other than sterling which gives rise to revenues in those currencies.
In order to protect the group's sterling balance sheet from the movements in these currencies and the sterling exchange rate, the group finances its loans and investments by means of borrowings in the respective currency and by way of forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, the group does not have material financial exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses.
After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the group to hedge its future income, the interest rate profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 January 2004 was as follows: Financial assets Financial liabilities Floating rate Fixed rate Floating rate Fixed rate financial financial financial financial Total assets assets Total liabilities liabilities m m m m m m Sterling 220.9 205.1 15.8 126.4 126.4 - Euro 769.1 704.0 65.1 793.6 793.6 - Other currencies 106.7 77.7 29.0 96.9 96.9 - 1,096.7 986.8 109.9 764.1 764.1 - The groups financial assets consist of long term loans and investments.
These usually have a term of between five and ten years, but are often prepaid prior to their contractual maturity.
The interest rate for each fixed rate asset is set at the commencement of the loan.
Interest rates for both floating rate assets and liabilities are based upon LIBOR plus the relevant margin.
Hedging Interest rates As stated in the groups accounting policies, the amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
In respect of the year to 31 January 2004, interest expense was reduced by 11.2m 2003 11.3m in order to reflect the amounts receivable for interest rate swaps.
These interest rate swaps are primarily used to hedge the groups private placements, thereby lowering the higher costs of borrowing fixed rate US Dollars by converting into floating rate Sterling and Euros.
Currency exposure Forward foreign exchange contracts denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at that date, or where appropriate, at the rate of exchange in related forward contracts.
However, because the group does not have any material financial currency exposure, this reduction in interest expense was offset by a corresponding increase arising from the translation of other monetary assets and liabilities, primarily its loans and investments, its bank borrowings, its private placements and its floating rate notes.
44 Intermediate Capital Group Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The carrying amounts and the estimated fair value of the groups outstanding financial instruments is set out below: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Net carrying Estimated Net carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Long-term loans and investments 1,085.5 1,167.5 876.1 947.5 Loans held for syndication 27.5 27.5 53.2 53.2 Cash at bank 38.6 38.6 1.9 1.9 Borrowings: Bank debt including overdraft 323.3 323.3 407.0 407.0 Floating rate notes 201.3 201.3 -- Private placements 231.3 231.3 266.0 266.0 Derivatives and financial instruments: Interest rate - 1.4 - 3.6 Foreign currency 41.9 41.9 18.7 18.7 The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values shown below: Long term loans and investments The estimate of the fair value of long term loans and investments is based on their cost, which is shown in the balance sheet at 1,085.5m, and the value of its warrants and listed equity shares.
The fair value of the loans and investments does not include an adjustment to reflect interest rate movements since the date of the transaction as such loans are not readily marketable.
The valuation of the warrants is based on the borrowers' current pro-forma earnings multiplied by the appropriate price earnings ratio.
Loans held for syndication, cash at bank and bank debt The carrying values of these instruments approximate to their fair values because of their short term nature.
Private placements These are fixed rate US Dollar liabilities whose market value may be different to the carrying value.
However, because the associated interest rate swaps provide a complete hedge to, and are considered part of, the transaction, any difference between the carrying value and fair value of the private placement will be offset by the difference on the associated interest rate swaps.
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps Foreign exchange contracts are revalued into sterling and shown in the balance sheet at their revalued amount.
The fair value will therefore equate to the carrying value.
The fair value of interest rate swaps with the exception of those swaps taken out as part of the private placement was estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
Floating rate notes The carrying value of these instruments approximate to their cost due to the immaterial movement in interest rates since their issue in June 2003.
