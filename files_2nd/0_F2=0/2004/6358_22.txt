Pension arrangements The group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the countries concerned.
The majority of schemes are of a defined contribution structure, including the contracted-in defined contribution schemes which are the main schemes for new UK employees.
In The Netherlands, employees are members of an industry-wide defined benefit scheme, but as it is not possible to separately identify the groups share of the assets and liabilities of the scheme it is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
Wackenhut Services, Inc. WSI is the administrator of several defined benefit plans in the United States.
WSI is responsible for making periodic cost-reimbursable deposits to the various defined benefit plans as determined by independent actuaries.
In each instance, the US Department of Energy DOE acknowledged within the contract entered between the DOE and WSI its responsibility for all unfunded pension and benefit liabilities.
Therefore, these plans are accounted for as defined contribution schemes.
The group operates defined benefit schemes in a number of countries but the only schemes of significance to the group are in the UK.
Contributions made to defined contribution schemes and to defined benefit schemes other than in the UK totalled 42.8m 2003: 39.5m.
In the UK, the membership of the Group 4 pension scheme is about 5,000.
The membership of the Securicor scheme, responsibility for which the group assumed on 20 July 2004 with the acquisition of Securicor plc, is about 21,000.
The assets of both UK defined benefit schemes are held in separate trusteeadministered funds.
The pension costs are assessed on the advice of qualified independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method.
The cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of UK defined benefit schemes amounted to 4.5m 2003: 2.7m, compared to contributions made of 4.2m 2003: 1.9m.
Regular actuarial assessments of the schemes are carried out, the latest being at 31 March 2002 in respect of the scheme demerged from the former Group 4 Falck A S and at 5 April 2003 in respect of the Securicor scheme.
Both schemes were certified by an independent actuary as meeting the Minimum Funding Requirement solvency level, in that the market value of assets exceeded the assessment of the schemes liabilities on a current funding level basis.
Both valuations have been updated to 31 December 2004.
At that date the market value of the schemes assets was 845.8m.
The most significant actuarial assumptions used in the calculation of liabilities were that the long-term composite rates of return on investments would be 2.3% above the risk-free return, 2.3% to 3.3% above the rate of annual salary increases and 4.3% above the rate of pension increase.
The assets comprise 100% of the schemes liabilities on actuarial assumptions which take account of future service and earnings increases.
Variances arising on the actuarial valuation of the defined benefit schemes are reviewed regularly and, in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 SSAP 24 : Accounting for pension costs, recognised in the profit and loss account over the average remaining service lives of the schemes members.
A provision of 4.5m 2003: 4.2m is included in the balance sheet in respect of additional SSAP 24 charges.
An additional cash contribution of 15m before tax has been made in the year commencing 1 January 2005, with no profit and loss account impact.
The contribution rates in respect of future service benefits are currently at an average of 11% of pensionable earnings in the Group 4 scheme and 14% in the Securicor scheme.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 : Retirement benefits was issued by the Accounting Standards Board in November 2000 but is not fully mandatory until the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2005.
Prior to this, transitional arrangements require the disclosure of certain items by way of note.

Pension arrangements continued The major assumptions for the UK defined benefit pension schemes valuations in accordance with the methodology prescribed by FRS 17 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % % % Rate of increase in salaries 3.8-4.8 3.8 3.3 Rate of increase in pension payment 2.8 2.7 2.4 Discount rate 5.9 5.6 5.5 Inflation assumption 2.8 2.8 2.3 On full compliance with FRS 17, the amounts which would have been charged to the consolidated profit and loss account and consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses for the year, on the basis of the valuation assumptions made as at the previous year ends, are as follows: 2004 2003 m m Profit loss on ordinary activities before interest, exceptional items and taxation Current service cost 8.4 4.3 Past service cost 8.4 4.3 Financial items Expected return on scheme assets 33.9 5.4 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 35.1 7.0 1.2 1.6 Total included within profit loss before taxation 9.6 5.9 Statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 30.2 10.1 Experience gains losses on scheme liabilities 2.7 3.1 Changes in assumptions in valuation of scheme liabilities 41.6 4.3 Total actuarial loss gain 8.7 2.7 History of experience gains and losses 2004 2003 2002 2001 Difference between expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount m 30.2 10.1 19.7 8.1 Percentage of scheme assets 4% 11% 25% 8% Experience gains losses on scheme liabilities: Amount m 2.7 3.1 3.1 3.2 Percentage of scheme liabilities 0% 2% 3% 3% Total actuarial loss gain: Amount m 8.7 2.7 32.0 11.2 Percentage of scheme liabilities 1% 2% 26% 10% 60 Group 4 Securicor ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 6.
Pension arrangements continued The market value of assets in the UK defined benefit schemes at 31 December 2004 and the expected rates of return are as follows: 2004 2004 2003 2003 2002 2002 m % m %m % Equities 598.5 7.8 79.7 7.8 62.2 7.5 Bonds 215.3 4.9 11.6 4.8 14.5 4.5 Other 32.0 4.9 5.7 4.0 3.7 4.0 Total market value of assets 845.8 97.0 80.4 Actuarial value of liability 1,038.6 144.2 128.2 Deficit in the scheme 192.8 47.2 47.8 Related deferred tax asset 57.8 14.2 14.4 Net pension liability 135.0 33.0 33.4 The analysis of the movement in the scheme deficits during the year calculated in accordance with FRS 17 is as follows: 2004 2003 m m Deficit in Group 4 scheme at 1 January 2004 47.2 47.8 Opening adjustment in respect of Global Solutions Limited demerger 6.9 Deficit in Securicor scheme at 20 July 2004 127.0 Current service cost 8.4 4.3 Contributions 6.6 3.8 Expected return on scheme assets 33.9 5.4 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 35.1 7.0 Actuarial loss gain 8.7 2.7 Deficit at 31 December 2004 192.8 47.2 FRS 17 specifies that pension liabilities should be discounted at an appropriate high quality corporate bond rate.
The directors consider that it is appropriate to apply the AA corporate bond rate which most closely approximates to the timescale of the liability profile and the asset portfolio of the schemes and have therefore used such a rate, being 5.9%, at 31 December 2004.
The effect of a 0.1% movement in the discount rate is to alter reported liabilities by approximately 14m.
The Group 4 pension scheme also included the employees of Global Solutions Limited, which was one of the businesses demerged from the security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A S on 19 July 2004.
The pension disclosures are presented as if that demerger had always been effective.
An adjustment of 6.9m has been made to the 1 January 2004 position as reported in the Listing Particulars on 4 June 2004 in respect of the effect of the demerger.
The UK defined benefit schemes are largely closed to new members.
Under the projected unit method of actuarial valuation prescribed by FRS 17 the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
If the pension schemes deficit calculated as above in accordance with FRS 17 had been recognised in the financial statements, the groups net assets and profit and loss account reserve would have been disclosed as follows: 2004 2003 m m Net assets excluding pension deficit 918.0 323.6 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 135.0 33.0 Net assets including pension deficit 783.0 290.6 Profit and loss account reserve excluding pension deficit 144.3 271.3 Pension deficit net of deferred tax 135.0 33.0 Profit and loss account reserve including pension deficit 9.3 238.3 61 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 7.

No deferred tax has been provided in respect of the remittance of earnings from overseas subsidiaries except to the extent that dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Tax losses to the value of 52.2m have not been recognised as deferred tax assets as their utilisation is uncertain and or long-term.
Dividends 2004 2003 m m Ordinary dividend Final proposed 1.85p, DKK 0.1981 23.5 3.3 The final dividend will be paid on 12 July 2005 to shareholders on the register on 10 June 2005.
The exchange rate used to translate the dividend into Danish Kroner is that at 10 March 2005.
The 2003 comparative is the final dividend declared by the former Group 4 Falck A S for 2003 at the rate of DKK 0.40 per former Group 4 Falck A S share equivalent to DKK 0.049 per Group 4 Securicor plc share.

This figure better allows the analysis of trends over time and the comparison of different businesses.
The adjustments made in this calculation are to: a Remove the impact of goodwill amortisation.
This charge does not aid comparability as it only applies to goodwill arising on acquisitions rather than internally-generated goodwill and it only applies to acquisitions after 1998. b Remove discontinued operations, so that the measure is on a broadly consistent basis from year to year.
c Remove the impact of one-off exceptional items that are not comparable from year to year.
Net assets by class of business and geographical segment continued Net assets of continuing operations, before interest bearing debt, includes 862.3m relating to acquisitions.
Discontinued operations included in the groups net assets as at 31 December 2004 represent the operations of Falck Nederland and its subsidiaries, of Group 4 Cash Services UK and of Securicor Luxembourg, all of which are located in Europe.

The market value of these investments at 31 December 2004 was 59.8m 2003: 56.3m, as quoted on the relevant market as at that date.
All subsidiary undertakings have been included within the consolidated financial statements of the group with the exception of those businesses which the group is required by the European commission to dispose of as a condition of approval of the acquisition of Securicor plc.
These businesses comprise Falck Nederland and its subsidiaries, Group 4 Cash Services UK and Securicor Luxembourg.
The subsidiary operations of Falck Nederland and Group 4 Cash Services UK which were owned by the group prior to the acquisition of Securicor plc, have been excluded from the consolidated financial statements because severe long-term restrictions hindered the exercise of the rights of the parent over the subsidiaries management during the process of divestment.
These subsidiary undertakings have therefore been fide-consolidated from 20 July 2004.
They are shown within current asset investments as they are held for re-sale and at their carrying value as at that date, less an impairment charge of 34.5m in respect of the net realisable value of Falck Nederland.
The investment in Securicor Luxembourg, which was acquired as part of Securicor plc, was held exclusively for resale.
The results of this subsidiary undertaking have not been consolidated and are shown as an investment at fair value at 31 December 2004.
The operations of Falck Nederland are in the process of being disposed of, whilst the operations of Group 4 Cash Services UK and of Securicor Luxembourg were sold on 4 March 2005.

Financial instruments Financial instrument disclosures, excluding short-term debtors and creditors other than bank borrowings as permitted under Financial Reporting Standards 13 FRS 13 : Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures, are as follows: Currency risk The group conducts business in many currencies.
Transaction risk is fairly limited as wherever possible each business operates in local currency, including financing activities.
However, the group publishes its financial statements in sterling and it is in consequence subject to foreign exchange risk due to the translation of the results and net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations in the translation into sterling of its overseas net assets by holding borrowings in foreign currencies.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net borrowings are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to offset exchange differences on foreign currency equity investments, in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 20: Foreign currency translation.
At 31 December 2004, the groups US dollar including dollar-related and euro including eurorelated net assets before net borrowings respectively were approximately 82% and 46% hedged by net borrowings.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and, within this category of market risk, is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the directors, primarily by utilising interest rate swaps and, where appropriate, forward rate agreements to manage short term interest rate exposures.
At 31 December 2004 the group had no existing swaps or forward rate agreements.

The weighted average period to maturity of the non-interest bearing liabilities, which comprise other creditors falling due after more than one year note 19 and other provisions note 20, is two years.

The value of the final insurance settlements and the timing of the expenditure is uncertain.
Pensions The pension provision represents the liability for pension obligations, including those disclosed in note 6 above in respect of UK defined benefit schemes, under SSAP 24.
Other provisions Other provisions mainly comprise those for restructuring and onerous property leases.
Restructuring provisions include amounts for redundancy payments and the cost of closure of activities in acquired businesses.
An onerous property provision is provided against future liabilities for all properties sub-let at a shortfall and for long-term idle properties.
The provision is based on the value of future net cash outflows relating to rent, rates, service charges and costs of marketing the properties.

Share capital continued At 31 December 2003, the authorised share capital of the company was 100 divided into 100 ordinary shares with a nominal value of 1 each, of which two were issued.
On 6 May 2004, the authorised share capital of the company was increased from 100 to 50,000 by the creation of 49,900 ordinary shares of 1 each: 49,998 of the authorised but unissued ordinary shares of 1 each were re-designated and converted into 49,998 non-voting, non-dividend bearing redeemable preference shares of 1 each: and each of the two issued ordinary shares of 1 each were subdivided into 20 ordinary shares of 5 pence each.
On 11 May 2004, the company allotted the 49,998 redeemable preference shares fully paid.
The redemption of these shares is mandatory at a nil premium.
Redemption occurs automatically on the availability of distributable reserves.
On 2 June 2004, the Company increased its authorised share capital from 50,000 to 500,000,000 by the creation of 9,999,000,000 ordinary shares of 5 pence each.

On 19 July 2004, pursuant to the combination of the security businesses of the former Group 4 Falck A S with Securicor plc, 655,834,513 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were issued to the 90.0% of the shareholders of the former Group 4 Falck A S who accepted the initial offer and 542,222,079 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were issued to the shareholders of Securicor plc.
On 4 October 2004, 65,970,476 ordinary shares of 25 pence each were issued to a further 9.1% of the shareholders of the former Group 4 Falck A S who accepted the mandatory offer.

Quasi-subsidiary The group owns all of the shares in Wackenhut Services, Inc. WSI, under US Foreign Ownership Controlling Interest provisions.
WSI provides security services to US Government agencies including security services on sites deemed to be strategically sensitive.
Whilst the group is represented on the WSI board through shareholder proxies, operational control remains with an independent board reporting directly to the US government.
The results of WSI are consolidated into the groups results on the basis that WSI is considered to be a quasi-subsidiary in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 5: Reporting the substance of transactions.
The financial results of WSI prepared in accordance with group accounting policies and included in the consolidated financial statements, are as follows: 2004 2003 m m Profit and loss account: Turnover 237.0 241.4 Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 16.4 17.6 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 5.8 6.3 Profit for the year 10.6 11.3 Balance Sheet Fixed assets 6.6 0.9 Current assets 65.7 50.3 Creditors amounts falling due within one year 42.2 25.8 Amounts payable to group companies 10.6 Total assets less current liabilities 30.1 14.8 Creditors amounts falling due after more than one year 2.3 Provisions for liabilities and charges 2.2 1.9 Net assets 25.6 12.9 Cash flow statement Net cash flow from operating activities 12.6 13.3 Net cash flow from returns on investments and servicing of finance 2.1 2.9 Net cash flow from capital expenditure and financial investment 0.5 0.6 Net cash flow from acquisitions and disposals 5.5 Taxation 3.4 0.8 Dividends paid 4.5 15.7 Cash flow before use of liquid resources and financing 24.4 0.9 Net cash flow from financing 24.4 0.9 Decrease in cash in the year 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 24.
Contingent liabilities The companys wholly-owned US subsidiary, Argenbright Security, Inc. Argenbright was responsible for passenger checkpoint security screening for two of the flights involved in the terrorist atrocities of 11 September 2001, being the United Airlines flight from Newark to San Francisco and the American Airlines flight from Washington to Los Angeles.
The hijacked planes performing these flights crashed respectively in rural Pennsylvania and into the Pentagon, Washington.
The directors believe that, in respect of those two flights, Argenbright carried out its security screening services properly and in accordance with its contractual and regulatory duties and that it should have no liability for the losses that occurred subsequently.
However, the events of 11 September were so extraordinary that it is impossible at this stage to state with certainty that no findings against Argenbright will be made.
Argenbright is being sued and a number of lawsuits have been served upon it.
Securicor plc has also been named in some of the lawsuits.
At 11 September 2001, Argenbright, which is a stand-alone limited liability corporation, had in place aviation liability insurance which included cover for acts of terrorism and which, the directors believe, provided insurance cover of US$1billion for each of the two flights referred to above.
Additionally, contingent liabilities exist in respect of agreements entered into in the normal course of business.
