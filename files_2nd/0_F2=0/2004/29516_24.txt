Supplementary Financial Information Average Balance Sheets and Yield The following tables set out the average balances and yields for Standard Chartereds assets and liabilities for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.
For the purpose of the following table, average balances have generally been determined on the basis of daily balances, except for certain categories, for which balances have been determined less frequently.
The Company does not believe that the information presented in this table would be significantly different had such balances been determined on a daily basis.
