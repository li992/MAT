The calculation of the basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of 311.0 million 2003: 260.9 million divided by the average number of shares in issue during the year of 384.8 million 2003: 380.6 million.

The calculation is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average number of shares in issue plus the dilutive potential ordinary shares amounting to 5.6 million 2003: 8.4 million shares.
The dilutive potential ordinary shares relate to shares allotted under employee share schemes where the fair value price exceeds the option price.
The calculation of shareholders funds per ordinary share is based on shareholders funds for the Group at the end of the year divided by the number of shares in issue at the end of the year of 391.5 million 2003: 384.1 million.

Salary increases were assumed to exceed price ination by 2.0% per annum.
Pension increases were assumed to be in line with price ination.

21 INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY HEDGES As explained in the Financial Review on pages 26 to 28, the Groups policy is to hedge part of the interest rate risk and transactional currency exposure.
Gains and losses on interest rate and currency hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recorded.
Unrecognised and deferred gains and losses on interest and currency instruments used for hedging, and the movements therein, are as follows: Unrecognised Deferred Gains Losses Net Gains Losses Net m m m m m m Gains Losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 5.4 2.4 3.0 1.5 1.5 Gains Losses arising in previous years included in 2004 income 3.7 1.1 2.6 Gains Losses arising before 31 December 2003 not included in 2004 income 1.7 1.3 0.4 1.5 1.5 Gains Losses arising in 2004 not included in 2004 income 4.1 1.6 2.5 1.5 1.5 Gains Losses on hedges at 31 December 2004 5.8 2.9 2.9 of which: Gains Losses to be recognised in 2005 2.7 0.4 2.3 Gains Losses to be recognised in 2006 or later 3.1 2.5 0.6 22 CURRENCY EXPOSURE AND ANALYSIS OF NET ASSETS The Groups principal subsidiaries have little transactional currency exposure as they neither export goods nor import any material amount of products nor have any significant level of intra-group trading or provision of services.
Consequently, none of the principal subsidiaries has any material net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities by reference to their local currencies and hence the amount of foreign exchange differences included in the Group profit and loss account for 2003 and 2004 was not material.

co. uk 61 23 FAIR VALUES The fair value is dened as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, excluding accrued interest, and is calculated by reference to market rates discounted to current value.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash ows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
All debt and financial instruments used to manage the interest rate and currency of borrowings with a maturity of less than three months after the balance sheet date are assumed to have a fair value equal to the book value.
The book values are the amounts recorded in the balance sheet.
Financial liability provisions relate to rental guarantees as set out in note 25.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities that are hedged using currency swaps are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the book value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the fair value of the hedging instrument.
For the purpose of the table below, the book value of the relevant asset or liability is shown gross of the effect of the hedging instrument.
