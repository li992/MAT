Capitalised software Under UK GAAP as applied by Unilever, certain costs relating to the development and purchase of software for internal use are expensed when incurred.
Under US GAAP, these costs are capitalised and subsequently amortised over the estimated useful life of the software in conformity with Statement of Financial Position 98-1, Accounting for the Cost of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.
Restructuring costs Under Unilevers accounting policy, certain restructuring costs relating to employee terminations are recognised when a restructuring plan has been announced.
Under US GAAP, liabilities related to exit costs are recognised when incurred.
Employee termination costs are generally considered to be incurred when the company has a liability to the employee unless further service is required from the employee in which case costs are recognised as benets are earned.
Costs related to excess lease costs are reduced by assumed sub-lease income for the periods impacted.
Interest Unilever treats all interest costs as a charge to the profit and loss account in the current period.
Under US GAAP, interest incurred during the construction periods of tangible xed assets is capitalised and depreciated over the life of the assets.
