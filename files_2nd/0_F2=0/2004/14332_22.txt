The cash consideration received on the issue of Ordinary Shares on the exercise of share options during the year amounted to 261,000 2003: 1,437,000.

The holders of Deferred A and B Shares have no rights to participate in the profits of the Company, no voting rights and on a winding up or other return of capital only receive the nominal value of their shares if the holders of Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company have received the sum of 1 million per Ordinary Share and, as such, are classified as non-equity shares.
Under the terms of the settlement agreement, following the US launch and first commercial sale of Paxil CR by GlaxoSmithKline in 2002, the 12 million Deferred A Shares were automatically converted into 12 million Ordinary Shares.
The 12 million Deferred B Shares automatically convert to 12 million Ordinary Shares on the Companys receipt of a royalty statement under the current licence agreement stating that reported sales of Paxil CR have exceeded $1,000 million during any calendar period prior to 1 January 2006 or exceeded $337 million between 1 January 2006 and 3 May 2006.
In the event that this condition is not satisfied prior to 3 May 2006, the Deferred B Shares will not be converted and will be cancelled.
The vendor will not be entitled to any other nor additional compensation.
In the opinion of the Directors this condition will not be satisfied and the Deferred B Shares will not be converted and will be cancelled.
The Deferred A and B Shares were issued on 20 July 2000 when the price of an Ordinary Share was 94.25 pence.
The difference between the nominal value of the Deferred B Shares and their fair value, taken to be 94.25 pence, at issue has been recorded as non-equity share premium.
Warrants The Company has the following warrants outstanding: a D and E warrants The D and E Warrants were issued in March 2002 as part of the consideration for the agreement with Paul Capital to fund new product development.
The D and E Warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for a total of 5 million Ordinary Shares at any time during the period to 31 December 2008 at an exercise price of 73.75 pence per Ordinary Share.
A value of 0.3 million has been attributed to the D and E Warrants which has been recorded within Other Reserves.
b F warrants The F Warrants were issued in December 2003 as part of the 2.7 million $5 million loan with GE Capital Corp.
The F Warrants entitle the holders to subscribe for a total of 300,000 Ordinary Shares at any time until the repayment date of the loan at an exercise price of 1.20 per Ordinary Share.
A value of 39,000 has been attributed to the F Warrants which has been recorded within Other Reserves.
c Other warrants Warrants were issued in December 1999 as part of the acquisition of DepoTech and entitle the holders to subscribe for 371,353 Ordinary Shares at any time during the period beginning 31 December 1999 and ending on 25 February 2005 at an exercise price of $1.142 59.5 pence per Ordinary Share.
All of these warrants lapsed unexercised on 25 February 2005.
Share Schemes The Group encourages employee participation in its shares through ownership and continues to operate various incentive schemes whereby Directors and employees are to able to acquire shares in the Company.
Option Schemes Options granted to UK and European employees are only exercisable between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant, and are subject to the Companys Code of Conduct for dealing in Shares, and the Model Code.
Options granted to US employees prior to 2001 vest at 25% per annum from the date of grant and there were no performance criteria.
UK and European options granted prior to 2001 may only be exercised if the growth in the Companys share price over a consecutive three-year period exceeds the growth over the same period in the FTSE All Share Index.
This criteria was satisfied for the first time in March 2000.
Employees with options that are within their exercise period are now able to exercise those options within any one-year period from the date the performance condition is satisfied.
Super Options are exercisable after five years and are subject to higher performance conditions in accordance with those recommended by the Association of British Insurers.
Following changes to the option plans approved at the Annual General Meeting in June 2001, options granted to Directors and senior employees since that date are subject to performance conditions linked to the total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies, and are not subject to retesting.
Options granted to other US employees continue to vest at 25% per annum with no performance criteria, and other European employees who are not Directors or senior employees can exercise their options after three years and are not subject to performance conditions.
The Groups option plans are detailed further in the Remuneration Report.
It is the intention of the Group that no further options grants will be made under any of the option plans.

The market value of Ordinary Shares during 2004 ranged from the lowest closing mid-price of 50.0 pence to the highest closing mid-price of 75.25 pence per share.
Eligible employees are awarded rights to acquire a maximum number of shares at the beginning of a three year period, a proportion of which they will be entitled to receive at the end of that period depending on the extent to which the challenging performance conditions set by the Remuneration Committee at the time the allocation is made are satisfied.
Further information on the performance conditions of the Long Term Incentive Plan are detailed in the Remuneration Report.
At 31 December 2004, eligible employees hold rights over Ordinary Shares which may result in the issue of shares of 2,794,037 and 798,232 on 5 May 2007 and 20 September 2007.

The employees have to take their shares out of the plan on leaving the Company and will not be entitled to the Matching Shares if they leave within three years of buying the Partnership Shares.
As at 31 December 2004 289,560 Ordinary Shares had been issued by the Company to the trust at par value.

During 2004 the royalties received by SkyePharma were substantially in excess of the minimum payments required to be made to Paul Capital, consequently the company has not recognised a provision.

66 SkyePharma Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 26 Financial instruments The Group holds financial instruments to finance its operations and to manage the currency risk that arises from these operations.
The Group finances its operations through a combination of equity, convertible bonds, bank loans and other borrowings.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain continuity of funding through a mixture of long-term debt and bank loans, raised to cover specific projects, and through the issue of shares to collaborative partners, where necessary, to finance development contracts.
Short-term flexibility is provided through the use of overdrafts.
The maturity profile of the Groups debt is set out below at note c. Foreign currency risk All of the Groups operations are based overseas in Continental Europe and North America giving rise to exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates notably the Swiss Franc, Euro and US Dollar.
To minimise the impact of any fluctuations, the Groups policy has historically been to maintain natural hedges by relating the structure of borrowings to the trading cash flows that generate them.
Where subsidiaries are funded centrally, this is achieved by the use of long-term loans, the exchange differences on which are taken to reserves.
Where it has not been possible to use natural hedges, currency options, accrual forward options and forward currency contracts are used.
The Group has used these financial instruments during the year to minimise the currency exposure on operational transactions.
Interest rate risk The Group borrows at fixed and floating rates of interest as deemed appropriate for its circumstances.
Where necessary the Group uses interest rate swaps to achieve the desired interest rate profile including a cancellable fixed to floating rate interest rate swap on 30 million of the 6% convertible bond liability.
The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is set out in notes a and b respectively.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by third parties to financial instruments.
The Group does not expect any third parties to fail to meet their obligations given the policy of selecting only parties with high credit ratings and minimising its exposure to any one institution.
In the numerical disclosures that follow, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly as a result of the Groups operations are excluded from all disclosures with the exception of note f on currency exposures.

The Groups contributions to these plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate, and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group operates an unfunded defined benefit scheme in respect of its employees in France based on the national collective agreement of the pharmaceutical industry, and a provision of 416,000 is included in note 19: Provisions for liabilities and charges in respect of these obligations.
The scheme was amended in 2003 due to the introduction of the Fillon law in France.
The consequent increase in past service costs is being amortised over the remaining average expected active life of the employees.
Under the transitional provisions of FRS17: Retirement Benefits certain disclosures for the defined benefit scheme in France are required as follows: As at 31 December 2004 a valuation was performed by professionally qualified actuaries, Socit fide Prospective Actuariat et Conseil, on the present value of the accrued liabilities calculated under the projected unit method.

As at 29 December 2004 the total SkyePharma holding was 25,233,900 common shares and 20,000 warrants, representing approximately 34.5% of the common shares.
The investment has been treated as an associated undertaking from 29 December 2004.
As of 29 December 2004 SkyePharma began to exert significant influence and therefore the equity method of accounting has been adopted from that date.
Goodwill of 13.7 million arose on the acquisition.
By consideration of the likely commercial life of the Astralis technology, the Directors have determined that a suitable period over which to amortise the goodwill is 20 years.

74 SkyePharma Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29 Related party transactions At the end of December 1998, Ian Gowrie-Smith through a family-owned trust acquired a 51% interest in 10 East 63rd Street Inc. the company which owns 10 East 63rd Street, a property in New York.
In December 2002 Mr. Gowrie-Smith acquired a further 49% interest.
SkyePharma PLC has been in occupation of approximately half of that property since January 1997, subject to tenancy agreements based upon independent valuation.
In August 2003 the company took occupation of the entire building under an eight-year tenancy agreement, at which time the annual rent was increased from $420,000 per annum to $720,000 per annum until August 2008, and $942,500 per annum from August 2008 to August 2011.
A portion of these premises is currently sub-let by the Group.
30 Subsequent events In April 2005 SkyePharma entered into an amendment agreement with GlaxoSmithKline GSK in respect of Paxil CR.
Under the terms of the amendment agreement, GSK will make a one-time payment of approximately $10 million.
In addition, SkyePharma will also be entitled to an increase in the royalty rate from 3% to 4% on actual net sales of Paxil CR, with effect from March 2005.
As GSK has been unable to supply Paxil CR in the US since March 2005, GSK has also agreed to pay SkyePharma the same level of royalty on GSKs budgeted sales of Paxil CR from March 2005 while the product remains off the market subject to other terms of the agreement.
Approximately 5.0 million has been recorded as royalty income in 2004.
On 31 May 2005 the Group announced that it had signed agreements for a private placement of 20 million 8% convertible bonds, with a first put after five years by the holder of the bonds, and a final maturity of May 2025.
The bonds are expected to be issued in June 2005.
The bonds are convertible at the option of the holder into SkyePharma Ordinary Shares at a conversion price of 81 pence at any time prior to maturity.
Unless previously redeemed or converted, the bonds will be redeemed by the Group at their principal amount in May 2025.
The two convertible bonds existing at 31 December 2004, due in June 2005 and May 2024, are not affected by this transaction.
