No taxes have been provided for liabilities which may arise on the distribution of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates, except where distributions of such profits are planned.
Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates totalled approximately 1,527m at 31 December 2004 2003 1,309m: 2002 996m.
It is not practicable to calculate the tax which would arise on remittance of these amounts: the tax would be substantially lower if calculated at statutory rates after giving effect to foreign tax credits.

The change in valuation allowances during the year ended 31 December 2004 was 31m 2003 14m and the valuation allowance has been decreased by 6m 2003 2m by a change in circumstances.
Operating losses of 313m 2003 454m are carried forward and available to reduce future taxable income in a number of jurisdictions: these losses have given rise to deferred tax assets of 95m 2003 128m against which are set valuation adjustments of 52m 2003 83m.
3m of these losses, net of valuation allowances, have expiration dates through to 2007 and the balance can be carried forward indefinitely.
The deferred tax adjustments to net income and net equity to conform with US GAAP are disclosed in note 42.

Pensions SSAP 24 Group The Company and most of its subsidiaries operate retirement schemes which cover the majority of employees including Directors of the Group.
ICI policy, where practicable, is to provide retirement benefits for new employees on a defined contribution basis.
The Company pays pension contributions for each employee into an individual retirement account, which is used to provide pension benefits at retirement.
This policy is now in place in the majority of countries in which ICI operates.
However, retirement plans for most existing employees are generally of the defined benefit type under which benefits are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration and are funded through separate trustee-administered funds.
Formal valuations of the Groups main defined benefit schemes are undertaken regularly, by independent qualified actuaries, normally at least triennially and adopting the projected unit method.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligation of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
For the Groups major plans the principal weighted average rates used were: 2004 2003 %p.
Discount rate used in determining the actuarial present values of the benefit obligations 5.6 5.7 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 5.8 5.8 Rate of increase of future earnings 3.7 3.7 Increase in pensions in payment 2.1 2.1 In arriving at the valuations of the Groups major defined benefit schemes, fund assets were valued at market values on the date of valuation of each fund.
The value of these assets was 7,127m 2003 7,083m and was sufficient to cover 92% 2003 91% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The total pension cost for the Group for 2004 was 128m 2003 120m: 2002 89m.
Accrued pension costs, which are included in other creditors note 19, amounted to 33m 2003 37m.
Provisions mainly for the benefit obligations of a small number of unfunded plans amounted to 125m 2003 134m and are included in provisions for liabilities and charges pensions note 21.
Prepaid pension costs amounting to 530m 2003 507m are included in debtors note 16.
ICI Pension Fund The ICI Pension Fund accounts for approximately 85% of the Groups major plans in terms of asset values and projected benefit liabilities.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Fund, as at 31 March 2003, disclosed a solvency ratio of 93% and the Company has agreed to make a further nine annual payments into the Fund of 62m per annum from 2004 to 2012, subject to a review at the next valuation.
As from September 2004, the Company has also provided an asset-backed guarantee, via a wholly owned subsidiary, Receivables Funding Ltd, specifically incorporated to provide the guarantee for 250m to support its commitments to the Fund see note 40.
The deficit, together with the prepayment, is taken into account in arriving at the employers pension costs charged in the accounts by being amortised as a percentage of pensionable emoluments over the expected working lifetime of existing members.
In 2004 this gave rise to a SSAP 24 charge of 52m 2003 42m.
Healthcare UITF Abstract 6 The Group provides in North America, and to a lesser extent in some other countries, unfunded healthcare and life assurance benefits for retired employees.
At 31 December 2004 approximately 18,000 2003 18,000 current and retired employees were eligible to benefit from these schemes.
The liabilities in respect of these benefits are fully accrued over the expected working lifetime of the existing members.
The total post-retirement healthcare cost for the Groups major post-retirement benefit schemes for 2004 was 14m 2003 15m: 2002 12m and the provision at the year end was 160m 2003 167m.
The total post-retirement healthcare provision at the year end, including the Groups minor post-retirement benefit schemes, was 176m 2003 188m.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 6, the Group has adopted the measurement basis of the US Standard, SFAS No.
106 as the basis of its UK GAAP reporting.
Costs and provisions were determined on an actuarial basis.
The assumptions relating to the schemes are set out in the table in note 42.
The healthcare cost trend has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
For the Group, increasing the assumed healthcare cost for the major schemes by 1% in every year would increase the accumulated post-retirement benefit obligation as of 31 December 2004 by 12m 2003 11m and the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic post-retirement benefit cost for the year ended 31 December 2004 by 1m 2003 1m.

The figures shown above take into account various interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to manage the interest rate and currency profile of financial assets and liabilities.
b Currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities As explained in the Operating and Financial Review, on page 22, the Groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
As a result there are no significant non functional currency exposures.
c Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, as defined in section a above, at 31 December 2004 was as follows: 2004 2003 m m In one year or less 302 563 In more than one year but not more than two years 172 151 In more than two years but not more than five years 670 907 In more than five years 289 312 1,433 1,933 ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 ACCOUNTS Notes relating to the accounts 37 Financial risk management continued d Borrowing facilities Committed undrawn facilities available to the Group at 31 December 2004 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date were as follows: 2004 2003 m m Expiring in one year or less 100 Expiring in more than one year but less than two years 355 Expiring in more than two years 363 777 718 877 104 e Net debt management The Group manages the currency and interest rate exposure which arises on borrowings and cash not immediately required by the business on a net basis through the use of currency swaps, forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and interest rate caps.
The most significant consequences of this approach are: to manage the currency exposures arising from loans by holding cash and through currency swaps.
to reduce the proportion of the Groups fixed interest rate liabilities arising from loans through the use of fixed to floating rate swaps.
The financial instruments used in debt management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 58 and 59.
The notional principal amounts and fair values, net of associated hedges, of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities were as follows: Notional principal amounts Carrying values Fair values At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m m m Interests in participating and other investments other investments 35 32 35 32 35 32 Current asset investments and short-term deposits 81 260 81 260 81 260 Cash 326 235 326 235 326 235 Other financial assets 26 27 26 27 26 27 Short-term borrowings 135 28 137 29 137 29 Loans 1,279 1,836 1,278 1,834 1,355 1,940 Other financial liabilities 14 18 14 17 14 18 Currency swaps 3 605 4 53 2 21 Interest rate swaps 1,860 3,215 12 17 Total net liabilities 965 1,379 1,028 1,437 Financial assets 468 Financial liabilities 1,433 965 liability The Group has assumed that the fair value approximates to the carrying value.
The fair value of the Groups long-term publicly quoted debt is based upon quoted market prices.
The fair value of the Groups non-publicly quoted debt, all swaps, and caps have been estimated from discounted anticipated cash flows utilising a zero coupon yield curve.
The total decrease in the fair value of long-term debt net of associated hedges for the year ended 31 December 2004 of 585m arose from the net repayment of loans 474m, favourable movements on foreign exchange 85m and favourable movements due to changes in interest rates 26m.
A portfolio approach is adopted to create the Groups target proportion of fixed and floating rate debt by currency.
The maturity profile of the net fixed rate exposure is spread over several years to reduce re-pricing risk.
Short-term borrowings include balances relating to forward exchange contracts.
These balances are further analysed in section g. Where interest rate and currency instruments are designated to a group of borrowings or cash and cash equivalents with similar characteristics, altering their interest rate or currency profile, the net cash amounts to be received or paid on the agreements are accrued in current assets or liabilities and recognised as an adjustment to interest income or expense accrual accounting.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 ACCOUNTS 37 Financial risk management continued e Net debt management continued The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event that counterparties to off balance sheet financial instruments do not perform according to the terms of the contract.
In the opinion of management, the counterparties to the financial instruments are creditworthy parties and the Group does not expect any significant loss to result from non-performance.
The immediate credit exposure of financial instruments is represented by those financial instruments that have a positive fair value at 31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2004 the aggregate value of all financial instruments with a positive fair value assets was 49m for currency swaps, 22m for interest rate swaps, 2m for forward contracts, nil for interest rate caps and nil for currency options.

The Group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures for up to 12 months ahead through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts and selective purchase of currency options.
Surplus funds are invested in instruments in a variety of currencies.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge these back to the currencies that are appropriate for the net debt portfolio.
The financial instruments used in currency management are accounted for as described in the Groups accounting policies on pages 58 and 59.
The notional principal amounts and fair values of forward exchange contracts used in currency management are as follows: Notional principal amounts Carrying values Fair values At 31 December At 31 December At 31 December 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m m m Hedging working capital 1 1 1 1 Forward contracts to buy currency 67 118 Forward contracts to sell currency 58 118 Hedging anticipated cash flows 3 7 Currency contracts to buy currency 92 Currency contracts to sell currency 84 Hedging debt 13 12 12 12 Forward contracts to buy currency 470 1,018 Forward contracts to sell currency 483 1,030 liability The carrying values of currency hedging instruments do not materially differ from the fair values based on quoted market prices.
ICI ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 ACCOUNTS Notes relating to the accounts 37 Financial risk management continued h Management of current asset investments Surplus funds are invested in high quality liquid marketable investments, including money market instruments, government securities and asset backed securities.
Investments are of a plain vanilla nature with no embedded interest rate options.
The majority of asset-backed securities have some risk of early redemption, but are of a floating rate nature and hence have minimal fixed interest rate risk.
There are no investments of a fixed rate nature with maturity greater than one year and consequently the fair value of investments is considered to be materially the same as the value in the Groups balance sheet.

1 Revised 1996 Cash Flow Statements, the objective of which is similar to that set out in the US Standard SFAS No.
The two statements differ, however, in their definitions of cash and their presentation of the main constituent items of cash flow.
The definition of cash in the UK Standard is limited to cash plus deposits less overdrafts borrowings repayable on demand without penalty.
In the US, the definition in SFAS No.
95 excludes overdrafts but is widened to include cash equivalents, comprising short-term highly liquid investments that are both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and so near their maturities that they present insignificant risk of changes in value: generally, only investments with original maturities of 3 months or less qualify for inclusion.
Calculated in accordance with SFAS No.

The cash flows within the UK GAAP headings of Operating activities, Returns on investments and servicing of finance and Taxation would all be included within the heading of Net cash provided by operating activities under SFAS No.
Likewise, the UK GAAP headings of Capital expenditure and financial investment and Acquisitions and disposals correspond with Cash flows from investing activities under SFAS No.
95, and Equity dividends paid, Management of liquid resources and Financing in UK GAAP, subject to adjustments for cash equivalents, correspond with Cash flows from financing activities under US GAAP.

These principles, which have been determined and adopted by the fiduciaries of ICIs pension funds worldwide, include guidelines in the areas of governance, risk budgeting, strategic asset allocation and benchmarks, manager structure and selection, monitoring and other investment issues such as derivatives and self investment.
The over-arching principle clearly states that strategic asset allocation should be determined through explicit consideration of each plans specific liability profile and funding level and not by local common practice.
Furthermore, all plans must establish a strategic asset allocation benchmark, a relevant total plan performance benchmark and a process for controlling deviations from the strategic asset allocation benchmark.
Pension funds are expected to invest in a diversified range of asset classes and investment managers.
These assets may include derivatives up to a maximum of 10% of the individual fund unless a higher percentage is agreed after consultation with the Company.
However, no self-investment is permitted.
Whilst the Company expects to be consulted on these strategic and other matters, it recognises that final responsibility for establishing investment strategy often rests with local fiduciaries, who do not publish target allocations to asset classes.
Expected contributions The best estimate of amounts expected to be contributed to pension plans during 2005 is 133m.
The best estimate of amounts expected to be contributed to other post-retirement benefit plans in 2005 is 10m.
