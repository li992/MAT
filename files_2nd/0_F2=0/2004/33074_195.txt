Until conversion formally takes place by amendment of the Articles of Association the entitlements to dividends and voting rights are based on the underlying Dutch guilder amounts.
The 7%, 6% and 4% preference shares of NV are entitled to dividends at the rates indicated.
The 0.05 preference shares of NV are entitled to a dividend of 65% of the six months Euribor interest rate on their notional value.
A nominal dividend of 0.25% is paid on the deferred stock of PLC.
The 4% cumulative preference capital of NV is redeemable at par at the companys option either wholly or in part.
On 15 February 2005 after close of trading NV converted the 0.05 cumulative preference shares into NV ordinary shares.
Upon conversion, the holders of the preference shares received one NV ordinary share for every 11.2 preference shares held.
This resulted in a total of 18 881 587 NV ordinary shares being transferred to the preference shareholders.
These NV ordinary shares had previously been held as treasury shares by NV.
As a consequence of the conversion, the notional value of the shares was reduced to 0.05.
A proposal will be put to the Annual General Meeting of NV on 10 May 2005 to cancel the preference shares upon repayment of the notional value in accordance with NVs Articles of Association.
The other classes of preferential share capital of NV and the deferred stock of PLC are not redeemable.
For information on the rights of shareholders of NV and PLC and the operation of the Equalisation Agreement, see Corporate governance on pages 52, 53, 58 and 59.
Internal holdings The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2 400 inclusive in NV and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N. V. Elma, a subsidiary of NV, and one half by United Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of PLC.
This capital is eliminated on consolidation.
It carries the right to nominate persons for election as Directors at general meetings of shareholders.
The subsidiaries mentioned above have waived their rights to dividends on their ordinary shares in NV.
Share options The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options over ordinary shares of NV and PLC.
Full details of these plans are given in note 30 on pages 138 to 147.
