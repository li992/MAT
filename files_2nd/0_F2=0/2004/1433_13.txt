CURRENCY EXPOSURES The extent to which the groups operating entities hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency has been reviewed.
Taking into account the impact of forward foreign exchange currency contracts, the group had no material profit and loss exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency as at 31 December 2004.

DESCRIPTION OF PLANS The group participates in a number of pension schemes, principally in the UK.
The major scheme is a funded defined benefits scheme The Associated British Ports Group Pension Scheme.
The defined benefits section of this scheme was closed to new members with effect from 1 April 2002.
New members joining this scheme from 1 April 2002 are offered membership of a defined contributions section, which at 31 December 2004 constituted less than 0.6 per cent of the total asset value.
The assets of the groups pension schemes are held in trust funds independent of its finances.
Other schemes comprise defined contribution plans and unfunded retirement benefit arrangements in respect of former employees.
SUMMARY i Profit and loss account The total pension costs included in the profit and loss account for the group, which are disclosed in note 7 to the accounts, are derived as follows: 2004 2003 M M Defined benefits scheme and unfunded retirement benefit arrangements note 25c 6.4 7.2 Defined contribution scheme 0.6 0.4 Cost of pension benefits in other group schemes 0.7 0.9 Operating profit charge 7.7 8.5 Net credit to finance income 5.3 3.3 PROFIT AND LOSS CHARGE 2.4 5.2 Prior year restated for the effects of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts note 35 60 ASSOCIATED BRITISH PORTS HOLDINGS PLC PERFORMANCE RESULTS GOVERNANCE 25.

DEFINED BENEFITS SCHEME AND UNFUNDED RETIREMENT BENEFIT ARRANGEMENTS The latest formal valuation of The Associated British Ports Group Pension Scheme was carried out as at 31 December 2003.
The valuation of the liabilities detailed below has been derived by projecting forward the position as at 31 December 2003 and has been performed by an independent actuary, Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow.
FRS 17 gives the present value of pension liabilities by discounting pension commitments including an allowance for salary growth, using a AA corporate bond yield.
The value of unfunded retirement benefit arrangements has also been assessed by the actuary Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the same assumptions as those used to calculate The Associated British Ports Group Pension Scheme liabilities.
i Assumptions The major financial assumptions used by the actuary under FRS 17 as at 31 December were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 %%% Inflation 2.75 2.50 2.35 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.25 4.00 3.85 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.75 2.50 2.35 Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.75 2.50 2.35 Discount rate 5.30 5.40 5.50 ii Profit and loss account The amount charged to operating profit and the amount credited to finance income during the year were as follows: 2004 2003 M M OPERATING PROFIT Current service cost 6.4 7.2 Past service cost Total charge to operating profit 6.4 7.2 FINANCE INCOME Expected returns on pension scheme assets 25.4 22.6 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 19.9 19.1 Interest on unfunded retirement benefit liabilities 0.2 0.2 Net credit to finance income 5.3 3.3 NET PENSION CHARGE 1.1 3.9 Prior year restated for the effects of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts note 35 ASSOCIATED BRITISH PORTS HOLDINGS PLC 61 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 25.

DISPOSAL On 17 May 2004, the group sold its 45 per cent interest in The Cardiff Bay Partnership to Norwich Union Life and Pensions Limited for a cash consideration of 15.8m.
The net proceeds of 15.7m, after taking into account costs of 0.1m, were broadly in line with the net book value of the groups interest in The Cardiff Bay Partnership.
During the year ended 31 December 2004, the group paid costs of 0.1m 2003: 1.9m in relation to the disposal, in 2002, of AMPORTS Aviation division.

These shares, representing 6.4 per cent of ordinary shares in issue at 31 December 2003, were purchased following the groups decision to return 205m to shareholders.
This was as a result of the governments rejection of the Dibden Terminal development 100m, together with the utilisation of the sale proceeds from the disposal of The Cardiff Bay Partnership 30m.
This was then increased by a further 75m, having taken into consideration the future capital requirements of the group.
The total cost of the share purchase including expenses and stamp duty of 95.5m was charged to the profit and loss account reserve.

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES CONTINUED ILLUSTRATIVE FAIR VALUES The following unaudited disclosures are provided voluntarily in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standard IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, that came into effect for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and requires a charge to be recognised on share-based awards to employees over the period of the grant date to the vesting date of the option.
The cost is assessed on a fair value basis with the measurement at the grant date.
Share awards made after 7 November 2002 that have not vested by 1 January 2005 are affected by this standard.
To enable readers to better understand the effect of adopting this standard, the group has decided to disclose the fair value of any award that had not been settled at the publication date of IFRS 2 Sharebased Payment, which was February 2004 and the portion of fair value that would have been charged in these financial statements.
Due to the exercise period of the Executive Share Option Scheme and the maximum savings plan under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme being seven years, this requires the disclosure of fair values from 1996 onwards, as set out below.
The group has observed the actual vesting percentages of completed schemes and the expected vesting percentages of ongoing schemes in calculating the profit and loss charge that would have been recognised for share-based payments.
This would have resulted in the following charge to the profit and loss account: 2004 2003 M M Grants during 2004 0.8 Grants during 2003 0.9 0.9 Grants in prior years charge 0.6 1.1 TOTAL PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT CHARGE 2.3 2.0 ASSOCIATED BRITISH PORTS HOLDINGS PLC 65 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 28B.

SHARE OPTION SCHEMES CONTINUED Expected volatility has been taken as the historic 10-year average to May 2003 as, in the opinion of the directors, this is a reliable long-term measure of the companys share price volatility.
The risk-free rate has been taken as the yield on UK government treasury bonds with a maturity date approximating to the expected or contracted vesting date of the share or share option as published in the Financial Times on the grant date.
For options issued under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, to which no performance criteria apply, the observable historical lapse rate of 25 per cent has been applied in estimating the profit and loss account charge.
For options issued under the Executive Share Option Scheme, the observable historical lapse rate of 15 per cent has been applied in estimating the profit and loss account charge.
For options issued under the US Stock Purchase Plan and Californian Stock Purchase Plan, to which no performance criteria apply, an expected vesting percentage of 90 per cent has been applied.
For shares issued under the Long-Term Incentive Plan an expected vesting percentage of 50 per cent has been applied after taking into account the probabilities attached to the attainment of the market condition.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARD 17 RETIREMENT BENEFITS The group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, which sets out the revised accounting guidance on retirement benefits, for the first time in these financial statements.
Prior to this, the group had complied with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24 and the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits requires that financial statements reflect at fair value the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and the related funding.
The operating costs of providing retirement benefits are recognised in the period in which they are incurred, together with any related finance costs and changes in the value of assets and liabilities.
This contrasts with SSAP 24, which required the expected costs of providing pensions to be recognised on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the employer benefits from the employees services.

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CONTINUED URGENT ISSUES TASK FORCE ABSTRACT 38 ACCOUNTING FOR ESOP TRUSTS The group has adopted UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts for the first time in these financial statements.
This abstract requires the deduction of shares held for the purposes of employee share ownership plans from equity shareholders funds on the balance sheet.
Such shares were previously reported as fixed asset investments.
UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts also requires that gains or losses in an entitys own shares are recorded within equity shareholders funds on the balance sheet rather than through the companys profit and loss account, which was the previous practice.
URGENT ISSUES TASK FORCE ABSTRACT 17 REVISED 2003 EMPLOYEE SHARE SCHEMES UITF Abstract 17 Revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes has also been adopted by the group for the first time in these financial statements.
This abstract requires the provision for share-based payments to be shown within shareholders funds.
This had no impact on the results or the balance sheet for the year ended 31 December 2003, as no such provisions existed in 2003.
Comparative figures for the year ended 31 December 2003 have been restated to reflect the effects of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts as follows: FRS 17 UITF 38 ADJUSTADJUSTREPORTED MENT MENT RESTATED Year ended 31 December 2003 M M M M GROUP PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT UK ports & transport operating profit 152.3 14.1 0.1 138.1 Share of operating profit in associated undertakings 12.0 0.2 11.8 TOTAL UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 176.6 14.3 0.1 162.2 PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXATION 180.5 14.3 0.1 166.1 Net interest payable 35.0 0.2 34.8 Other finance income 3.0 3.0 PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES BEFORE TAXATION 145.5 11.1 0.1 134.3 Taxation on profit on ordinary activities 41.2 3.3 37.9 PROFIT ON ORDINARY ACTIVITIES AFTER TAXATION 104.3 7.8 0.1 96.4 Dividends 50.2 50.2 RETAINED PROFIT FOR THE GROUP AND ITS SHARE OF ASSOCIATED UNDERTAKINGS 54.1 7.8 0.1 46.2 EARNINGS PER SHARE UNDERLYING 31.0p 2.4p 28.6p GROUP BALANCE SHEET Investments 51.8 6.9 44.9 Debtors due after one year 88.1 88.1 Provisions for liabilities and charges 94.4 28.8 65.6 Pension asset net of unfunded retirement benefit liabilities 24.1 24.1 NET ASSETS 1,072.4 42.1 1,030.3 Equity shareholders funds profit and loss account 234.6 42.1 192.5 ASSOCIATED BRITISH PORTS HOLDINGS PLC 71
