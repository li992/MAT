2 1999, 2000 and 2001 have been restated for the adoption of FRS 19.
3 As first noted in 2002, operating profit for 2000 has been restated for the reclassification of the loss of $167 million arising on the anticipated disposal of Terra Industries Inc.
The disposal did not proceed and the loss has therefore been reclassified into operating exceptional items as an impairment.
4 2000 and 1999 have been restated to reflect the three-for-one bonus issue in May 2001.
5 EBITDA is operating profit before exceptional items plus depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and share of EBITDA of joint ventures and associates.
6 EBITDA interest cover is EBITDA divided by net interest expense, excluding other net financial income 2004: $119 million and exceptional financing charges 2004: nil.
EBITDA interest cover for 2002 is annualised to account for acquisitions during the year.
The actual EBITDA interest cover for 2002 was 25.5 times.
For 2000 and 1999 EBITDA interest cover is not applicable as the Group was a net interest recipient after adjusting for other net financial income.
7 Total capital is the sum of shareholders funds, net debt and minority interests.
8 Return on capital employed is calculated as total operating profit before impairments for the year divided by the average total capital less other investments and adjusted for impairments.
