Accounts 74 Headlam Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31.
PENSION COMMITMENTS During the year the group operated one defined benefit and a number of defined contribution schemes.
The Headlam Group plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme provides defined benefits to the employees of the company that have been admitted into the Scheme.
The Scheme is self-administered and its assets are held independently of the companys finances.
The Scheme is funded partly by contributions from members and partly by contributions from the company at rates advised by professionally qualified actuaries.
The latest actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method.
The main annual rate assumptions used by the actuary were, increase in salaries 5.0%, increase of pensions in payment 3.0%, discount rate before retirement 6.8%, discount rate after retirement 5.3% and inflation 3.0%.
Assets were taken at their audited market value at the valuation date.
At 31 March 2002 the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 31,802,000, which was sufficient to cover 85% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The valuation also recommended that the employers contribution rates be increased, with effect from November 2002, to 27.0%.
It was confirmed that payment of contributions in accordance with the recommended rates was in excess of what was required to comply with the statutory requirement to maintain the Schemes Minimum Funding Requirement MFR funding level above 100% over the period the contribution rate is certified.
With effect from 31 January 2003, all of the assets and liabilities of the Vertika International Limited Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme were transferred to the Headlam Group plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme.
The group retained the liability for the Vertika Scheme, comprising solely of deferred members following the disposal of Vertika International Ltd in September 2002.
The last actuarial valuation of the Vertika Scheme prior to the merger was carried out as at 1 May 2000 using the method and assumptions set down by the Government for the purposes of the MFR.
At 1 May 2000 the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 830,000, which was sufficient to cover 77% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
This represented a deficit of 249,000 but at the transfer date the scheme had a surplus on the MFR basis amounting to 163,000.
The total pension cost to the group was 2,592,000 2003: 2,434,000 and at 31 December 2004 there was an amount of 226,000 2003: 213,000 owed to the scheme, being employer and employee contributions due for December 2004 but not received by 31 December 2004.
Included within the total pension cost off the group are costs relating to the groups defined contribution salaries.
The pension cost charge for the year represents contributions payable by the group to the scheme and amounted to 1,158,000 2003: 968,000.
Contributions amounting to 103,000 2003: 86,000 were payable to the scheme at 31 December 2004 and these are included in creditors.
Headlam Group plc Staff Retirement Benefits Scheme The company operates a funded final salary pension scheme in the UK.
"In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 ""Retirement Benefits"" replacing SSAP 24 ""Accounting for Pension Costs""."
FRS 17 is fully effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, though certain disclosures are required in the transitional period, for periods ending on or after 22 June 2001.
These further disclosures are included below.
The pension cost that would have been charged to operating profit under FRS 17 for the year amounts to 1,000,000 2003: 781,000.
This is the service cost of 992,000 2003: 776,000 plus the special contributions of 8,000 2003: 5,000 applied to provide additional benefits.
Accounts 75 Headlam Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued An actuarial valuation in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 was carried out at 31 December 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
The main assumptions used by the actuary were At 31 December 2004 At 31 December 2003 At 31 December 2002 % pa % pa % pa Rate of increase in salaries 4.9% 4.9% 4.4% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.9% 2.9% 2.4% Discount rate 5.5% 5.6% 6.0% Inflation assumption 2.9% 2.9% 2.4% The assumptions used by the actuary are best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are thus inherently uncertain, were:- Long-term rate Long-term rate Long-term rate of return of return of return expected at Fair value at expected at Fair value at expected at Fair value at 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2004 2004 2003 2003 2002 2002 %pa 000 %pa 000 %pa 000 Equities and property 7.60% 23,888 7.80% 21,686 7.50% 18,178 Fixed interest 4.60% 6,623 4.80% 5,641 4.50% 5,062 Index linked gilts 4.60% 3,263 4.80% 2,837 4.50% 2,484 Insured annuities 5.50% 2,726 5.60% 2,763 6.00% 2,801 Cash and other 4.75% 59 3.80% 91 4.00% 79 Total market value of assets 36,559 33,018 28,604 Present value of liabilities 48,940 45,428 36,226 Deficit in the plan 12,381 12,410 7,622 Related deferred tax asset 3,714 3,971 2,439 Net pension liability 8,667 8,439 5,183 Accounts 76 Headlam Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31.
PENSION COMMITMENTS - CONTINUED Volatility of FRS 17 It should be noted that the methodology and assumptions prescribed for the purposes of FRS 17 mean that the disclosures will be inherently volatile, varying greatly according to investment market conditions at each accounting date.
Movement in deficit during the year 2004 2003 000 000 Deficit in plan at the beginning of the year 12,410 7,622 Movement in year: Current service cost 992 776 Employer contributions 1,372 1,365 Past service costs 8 5 Other finance income 275 281 Actuarial gain 68 5,091 Deficit in plan at the end of the year 12,381 12,410 It should be noted that the scheme is closed to new entrants and so the use of the projected unit valuation method required by FRS 17 means that the current service cost, as a percentage of members salaries, is likely to increase as members approach retirement.
Contributions employer and employee amounting to 123,000 2003: 127,000 were due to the scheme as at the year end and these are included in creditors.
The current schedule of contributions requires the company to contribute at the rate of 27% of pensionable salaries.
