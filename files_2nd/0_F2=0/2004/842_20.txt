Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain land and buildings and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
Full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement benefits is not mandatory.
The additional disclosures required during the transitional period have been included in note 30 to the accounts.
In order to conform with the requirements of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and the amendment to UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes, investments in AMEC plc ordinary shares of 50 pence each held by the trustees of the Long-Term Incentive Plan and Performance Share Plan 2002 are recorded as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
Previously these shares were shown within investments.
In addition, purchases of shares which were previously shown in the cash flow statement within acquisitions and disposals are now disclosed within financing.
This has the effect of reducing net assets by 7.5 million and 6.0 million in 2004 and 2003 respectively.
This change has no impact on either the profit and loss account or the statement of total recognised gains and losses for either the prior year or the year under review.
AMEC acquired the outstanding 54 per cent interest in SPIE on 5 March 2003, after which it was fully consolidated in the accounts of AMEC.
Additional reviews of the SPIE balance sheet have resulted in the reallocation of amounts held within certain balance sheet captions as at 31 December 2003.
These changes provide additional consistency in the presentation of debtors and creditors and have no impact on the net assets of the group.
A new segmental format showing the nature of the groups total turnover, total operating profit and net assets has been adopted.
The segments reflect the changes to the composition of the group in 2004 arising from the exit of low margin, high risk construction activities.
In addition, the company was reclassified as a Support Services company in November 2004 and the new segmental format is expected to enhance the clarity of the groups reporting and lead to a greater understanding of its activities.
Basis of consolidation The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year and the groups share of the results and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the gross equity and equity methods of accounting, respectively.
Joint arrangements, where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
The company has not presented its own profit and loss account, as permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided on all tangible assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold land and buildings the shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment mainly three to five years Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Trading results are translated at average rates for the year.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward exchange contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken directly to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made post 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised, on a straight line basis, over its estimated useful life, which for large acquisitions is not expected to exceed 20 years and for smaller acquisitions, 10 years.
Where a business is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure includes any unamortised amount included within intangible assets.
As permitted by FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been written-off to reserves.
Where a business is disposed of or closed, the profit or loss on disposal or closure includes the attributable amount of goodwill previously charged to reserves.
Interest Interest is written-off to the profit and loss account as incurred by all subsidiaries in the group.
The group has, however, investments in joint ventures which are involved in public private partnership projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
In view of the nature of these projects, interest directly incurred in funding the construction programme is capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Long-term contracts Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are stated at cost plus attributable profits, less provision for any known or anticipated losses and payments on account, and are included in debtors.
Payments on account in excess of amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are included in creditors.
60 AMEC plc annual report 2004 1 Accounting policies continued Pensions Contributions to defined benefit schemes are allocated to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the normal expected service lives of employees.
Contributions to money purchase schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.
Share option schemes No charge is made to the profit and loss account in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all, or substantially all, UK employees.
Included within the profit and loss account reserve are shares in the company held by the AMEC plc Employee Share Trust.
This is a discretionary trust, established for the benefit of AMEC employees, the trustee of which is an independent trustee company which retains legal responsibility, control and ownership of these shares.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Turnover Turnover represents sales and value of work done excluding all internal transactions within the group.
Corporate costs comprise the costs of operating the head office of AMEC plc and also certain regional overheads.
These are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
The financing of the groups activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net interest payable cannot be analysed segmentally.
Due to the nature of the businesses acquired, goodwill amortisation capitalised cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets principally comprise assets relating to the pension schemes prepayment and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments.

For the United Kingdom, the basis of revaluation was existing use value for properties occupied by group companies and market value for those properties without group occupancy.
For properties outside the United Kingdom, the appropriate country valuation standards were adopted which generally reflect market value.
No provision has been made for the tax liability which may arise in the event that certain properties are disposed of at their revalued amounts.

As at 31 December 2004, there were six outstanding interest rate swaps under which the group pays a fixed rate of interest and receives a floating rate based on six months LIBOR.
The instruments cover US dollars, Canadian dollars, Euro and Sterling, and have a Sterling equivalent of 65.0 million.
The expiry dates range from January 2005 to January 2008, with a weighted average period to maturity of 29 months as at 31 December 2004.
In addition, there were two outstanding interest rate swaps under which the group pays a floating rate of interest and receives a fixed rate.

After taking into account the effects of forward foreign currency exchange contracts, there were no material currency exposures in respect of monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the relevant business unit.

74 AMEC plc annual report 2004 28 Lease commitments The current annual commitments payable under non-cancellable operating leases were as follows: Land and Land and Plant and Plant and buildings buildings equipment equipment 2004 2003 2004 2003 million million million million Group: Expiring: In one year or less 6.3 1.3 9.2 5.0 Between two and five years 14.2 10.7 9.6 15.0 Over five years 10.2 19.3 0.1 0.1 30.7 31.3 18.9 20.1 Company: Expiring: Over five years 0.4 29 Contingent liabilities Guarantees and indemnities Guarantees given by the company in respect of borrowings of subsidiaries amounted to nil as at 31 December 2004 2003: 0.2 million.
The borrowings of joint ventures, consolidated on a gross equity basis, are generally without recourse to AMEC other than for normal performance obligations which are usually given on a several basis.
AMEC has provided guarantees in respect of committed bank facilities granted to certain property joint ventures.
The borrowings drawn against these facilities amounted to 35.0 million at 31 December 2004 2003: 37.0 million and the current debt service ratios for these joint ventures are all within the agreed levels.
The company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued, on behalf of group companies, in the normal course of business.
On 2 February 2005, AMEC completed a series of transactions that resulted in the disposal of its effective interest in Derech Eretz Highway 1997 Limited, which owns the concession rights for the Cross Israel Highway, Derech Eretz Construction joint venture, which undertook the design and construction of the Highway and Derech Eretz Highways Management Corporation Limited which acts as the operator to the Highway.
As a result of these disposals, AMEC has been released from all guarantees and obligations relating to its various interests as at 31 December 2004.
Prior to the disposal, AMEC had provided direct and indirect support on a joint and several basis for a performance bond on the Cross Israel Highway Concession the Concession for an amount of 78.1 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: 83.7 million.
In addition, AMEC had also provided support on a joint and several basis, both directly to an intermediate holding company and indirectly from the intermediate holding company, to the Concession for letters of credit that the Concession had procured from external banks.
These letters principally relate to the performance obligations of the Concession.
The intermediate company in which AMEC had a one third share had a third share in the Concession and its share of the performance obligations of the Concession amounted to 10.9 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: 28.8 million.
The performance obligations of the Concession amounted to 32.7 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: 86.4 million.
As at 31 December 2004, AMEC has a commitment to invest 36.0 million 2003: 56.7 million in joint venture projects.
It has also provided guarantees on certain projects to invest further amounts of up to 16.4 million 2003: 9.8 million if the projects do not perform satisfactorily.
No future adverse events, however, are currently envisaged.
AMEC plc annual report 2004 75 Notes to the accounts continued 29 Contingent liabilities continued Legal claims and actions AMEC takes internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions for and against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are unlikely to succeed.
During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, entered into various contracts with the United States General Services Administration GSA for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a US Customs House in California.
The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the order of US$290 million.
Due, inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete.
ACMI contested the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims on this contract.
The United States Department of Justice then filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two federal felonies and paid two fines totalling approximately US$1.2 million.
AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC Americas and thus, the US Government.
The GSA subsequently filed a motion for summary judgement seeking an order declaring that ACMI had forfeited its claims on all the projects.
ACMI opposed the motion and oral argument was held in February 2004.
There were no further developments in the year ended 31 December 2004 and a decision is not expected for at least six months.
AMEC continues to hope that an amicable settlement of all the outstanding issues with the GSA can be secured but there is, at this time, no certainty that such an outcome will be achieved.
30 Pension arrangements The group operates a number of pension schemes for United Kingdom and overseas employees.
All United Kingdom members are in defined benefit schemes and the majority of overseas employees are in defined contribution schemes.
SSAP 24 accounting for pension costs Contributions by employees and employers are paid in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and are held separately from the assets of the group in trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the group was 13.5 million 2003: 12.8 million and there is a prepayment of pension costs as at 31 December 2004 of 80.1 million 2003: 70.3 million included within debtors: amounts falling due after one year.
The projected unit valuation method has been used to assess liabilities and future funding rates for the three major schemes which cover approximately 90 per cent of United Kingdom members.
The latest actuarial valuations of these schemes were undertaken as at 31 December 2001 and 1 April 2002.
These showed that the market value of the assets was 1,058.6 million, with the actuarial value of assets being sufficient to cover 114 per cent of the accrued benefits.
The principal assumptions were based upon future investment returns of 5.50 to 6.30 per cent, future pensionable salary increases of 3.70 to 4.75 per cent, future pension increases of 2.50 to 2.70 per cent and valuation rates of interest of 5.50 to 5.60 per cent.
FRS 17 retirement benefits The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent valuations of the three major schemes as at 31 December 2001 and 1 April 2002, and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the schemes liabilities under FRS 17, on a projected unit valuation method, are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Per cent Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.3 5.4 5.5 Rate of inflation 2.7 2.7 2.3 Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 3.7 3.3 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8 2.7 2.3 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
