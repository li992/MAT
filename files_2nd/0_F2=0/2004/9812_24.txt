The funds of the final salary scheme are administered by trustees and are separate from the Group.
The Group contribution rate was 32.0% of pensionable salaries throughout the year, following the recommendations of an independent qualified actuary.
The Final Salary Pension Scheme was closed to new entrants on 29 September 1997.
A Group Personal Pension plan has been made available to eligible employees since that date.
The latest scheme valuation conducted by an independent actuary for the Group was as at 1 September 2003.
The actuarial valuation was carried out using the projected unit method.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the funding position of the scheme are those relating to the differences between the long-term rate of investment return and the rate of increase in earnings.
The valuation as at 1 September 2003 assumed that the long-term investment return pre-retirement would exceed salary increases by 3.9% per annum and price inflation by 4.9% per annum.
It assumed that the long-term investment return after retirement would exceed salary increases by 2.1% per annum and price inflation by 3.1% per annum.
The market value of scheme assets was 135.3m, which was sufficient to cover 78.5% of members accrued benefits.
The Group increased its contribution rate to 32.0% with effect from September 2003, in response to this shortfall.
The Group paid total contributions of 5.8m 2003: 3.6m to the scheme during the period.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, it is expected that the costs of benefits will steadily rise in the future, as the average age of members increases.
A provision of 1.5m 2003: 3.0m is included in creditors representing the cumulative excess of pension costs charged to the profit and loss account over the Groups contributions paid.
Group Personal Pension plan The Group paid contributions of 0.4m 2003: 0.3m to the Group Personal Pension plan defined contribution scheme during the period.
