Pension Costs The Group operates several pension schemes.
The principal defined benefit schemes are the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme together, the Schemes, which are funded schemes.
These Schemes cover 90 per cent of the Groups pensionable employees in schemes providing defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the Schemes are held in Trust Funds which are independent of the Groups own assets.
In determining the level of contributions required to be made to the Schemes and the relevant charges to the Groups profit and loss account, the Group has been independently advised by Watson Wyatt LLP, Actuaries and Consultants.
The most recently published formal valuations of the Halifax Retirement Fund and the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme were carried out as at 31 March 2003 and 31 December 2001, respectively.
The financial assumptions are derived based upon the economic conditions prevailing at the date of valuation.
The different assumptions between the two Schemes are as a consequence of their differing valuation dates.
The main financial assumptions adopted for these calculations were as follows: Bank of Scotland Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme Rates per annum Rates per annum %% Future price inflation 2.50 2.50 Return on new investments 6.75 6.60 Return on existing investments 7.10 6.00 3 1 Increases in earnings 3.50 3.50 4 2 Increases in pensions 3.25 2.50 Notes: 1 In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
2 The pension increase is on the excess over the Guaranteed Minimum Pension.
3 This assumption applies for the first five years and thereafter 4% p. a. is assumed.
4 The pension increase assumption reflects the guaranteed minimum increase of 3% p. a. applying in the Halifax Retirement Fund.
The pension costs for accounting purposes have been calculated using the same assumptions as those adopted for the formal valuations with the exception that note 3 above does not apply.
92 HBOS plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 HBOS Annual Report V8 9 3 05 4:47 pm Page 93 8.
Pension Costs continued The following disclosures are based on these assumptions using the projected unit method of valuation: Bank of Scotland Halifax Retirement Fund 1976 Pension Scheme Effective date of valuation 31 March 2003 31 December 2001 Market value of assets 1,339m 1,409m Asset cover level 85% 98% Regular pension charge 12.9% 15.9% as a percentage of pensionable salaries This charge reduced from 15.0% in April 2004 following a change to the scheme rules to remove a 3% p. a. minimum pension increase.
The asset cover levels disclosed in the above table represent the ratios of the respective Schemes assets to the value of the benefits that had accrued to members and pensioners at the valuation dates after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and pensions.
The regular pension charges have been adjusted by spreading surplus assets or shortfalls in each of the Schemes over the average future working lifetimes of the memberships 15 years for the Halifax Retirement Fund and 16 years for the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme by fixed capital instalments plus interest on the reducing balances.
These elements, together with interest on the opening balance sheet positions result in a charge of 85 million 2003 74 million in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and 58 million 2003 56 million in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme.
Included within the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme charge is an exceptional charge of 2 million 2003 1 million.
Contributions to the Schemes of 146 million were paid over the year.
As contributions differed from the amount charged in the Profit and Loss Account a pension prepayment of 38 million 2003 36 million in respect of the Halifax Retirement Fund and a provision of 74 million 2003 75 million for future contributions in respect of the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme are included in the Balance Sheet.
This leads to an aggregate provision of 36 million 2003 39 million.
The Group currently contributes to the Halifax Retirement Fund at a rate of 13.6% of pensionable salaries, plus 0.3% of life assurance only members pensionable salaries plus additional lump sum payments of 2.5 million per month and to the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme at a rate of 16.6% of pensionable salaries.
The pension costs charged in the Profit and Loss Account include 34 million 2003 26 million relating to schemes other than the Schemes.
These costs are net of an amount of 6 million 2003 6 million in respect of The Equitable Pension and Life Assurance Scheme The Equitable Pension Scheme which The Equitable is obliged to reimburse to the Group.
Other Post-retirement Benefits The Group also provides post-retirement health care benefits and concessionary rate mortgages for certain pensioners and dependent spouses.
An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2004 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations at 41 million for the Group 2003 40 million.
The main additional financial assumption used was that over the long term the rate of increase in health care costs would be 6.75% p. a. being 4.25% p. a. higher than the rate of inflation.
The charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 for other postretirement benefits was 3 million 2003 3 million.
Included in provisions for liabilities and charges is 38 million 2003 37 million which represents the accrued amount for other post-retirement benefits.
FRS 17 Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 the Group continues to account for retirement benefits in accordance with SSAP 24 as detailed above.
The following additional disclosures under FRS 17 are required by way of narrative only.
The actuarial valuations used in assessing the FRS 17 disclosures are: the Halifax Retirement Fund valuation as at 31 March 2003 the Bank of Scotland 1976 Pension Scheme valuation as at 31 December 2001 These are the principal schemes for the Group but additional FRS 17 disclosure has been provided for all other defined benefit schemes within the Group.
These are detailed below under the heading Other Schemes.
For the Schemes and Other Schemes, each actuarial valuation is updated by qualified actuaries, principally Watson Wyatt LLP, to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the assets and liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004.

Pension Costs continued The liabilities of the Schemes and Other Schemes under FRS 17 were calculated using the Projected Unit method using the following financial assumptions: Rates per annum Rates per annum Rates per annum 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 % %% Future price inflation 2.80 2.80 2.40 Discount rate 5.45 5.60 5.80 1 Increases in earnings 3.80 3.80 3.40 2 Increases in pensions 2.80 2.80 2.40 Notes: 1 In addition to the general assumed rate of salary increases, there is a separate assumed salary scale of increases due to promotions and increasing seniority.
Pensions which are guaranteed to increase at a rate of 3.0% p. a. have been assumed to increase at 3.25% for the 2003 and 2004 calculations 3.0% for 2002.
The above rates apply to all Other Schemes with the exception of the schemes within Bank of Scotland Ireland Ltd, which are not significant.
The Schemes are closed to new entrants.
Under the Projected Unit method, the current service cost will increase as members of the Schemes approach retirement.

At 31 December 2004, under FRS 17, a deficit of 37 million 2003 55 million and a profit and loss charge of 13 million 2003 22 million would arise.
The Equitable is, however, obliged to reimburse the Group for certain excess costs of funding this scheme.
The contributions to Other Schemes referred to above are those paid by the Group and do not take account of amounts to be reimbursed by The Equitable.
Other Post-retirement Benefits An independent actuarial review as at 31 December 2004 estimated the present value of the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligations under FRS 17 at 46 million 2003 44 million for the Group.
There are no assets backing these obligations, and hence the notional balance sheet provision under FRS 17 is also 46 million 2003 44 million.
The notional charge in relation to these benefits amounted to 3 million 2003 3 million.
The main additional financial assumption used was that the long term rate of increase in health care costs would be 5.45% p. a. which is in line with the discount rate.

Long term Assurance Business The value of long term assurance business comprises the surplus attributable to the Group, including minority interests, together with the net present value of in-force business.
This method is known as the embedded value approach.
The principal economic assumptions are reviewed annually and are as follows: 2004 2003 % % 1 Risk discount rate net of tax 8.0 8.0 Return on equities net of tax credits 7.5 7.5 Return on Gilts gross of tax 5.0 5.0 Expense inflation 3.0 3.0 In-force business is defined as all live policies where the first premium has been paid.
For traditional with profits business, the surplus attributable to the Group equates to one ninth of the bonuses declared in any year.
The level of assumed future bonuses is calculated by projecting the portfolio of with profits business forward and applying reversionary and terminal bonus rates so as to exhaust the projected surplus of assets attributable to with profit policyholders.
For all other business, the entire surplus is attributable to the Group.
1 The discount rate contains an allowance for investment risk which is set at a level to ensure that the assumed effective investment return on corporate bonds and equities equates to that of the assumed return on gilts.
Accordingly, the value attributed to long term assurance business excludes any amount that relates to expected future investment margins which is in line with the requirements of FRS 27 Life Assurance.
