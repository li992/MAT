The group operates a pension scheme providing benets based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out at 6 April 2003 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes for the periods to 1 February 2004 and 2 February 2003 by a qualied independent actuary.
It has been agreed that a joint employer employee contribution rate of 148% of pensionable pay will apply in future years.
As the scheme is closed to new entrants, the current service cost as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increase as the membership ages, although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 2004 2003 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 425525% 375475% 375475% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 300% 250% 250% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 550% 575% 575% Ination assumption 300% 250% 250% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the groups operations.
Throughout the period under review, the group has not traded in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and a small amount of foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk The group nances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings at variable rates.
Liquidity risk The groups policy is that, to ensure continuity of funding, its borrowings are split between short-term overdraft facilities, deposits made overnight and longer term loans.
Short-term exibility is achieved using overdraft facilities.
Foreign currency risk The group has a subsidiary based in Holland but due to its size there is no material currency risk.
Goods purchased in foreign currencies are paid for at the exchange rate ruling at the time of payment although from time to time this may be xed in advance by forward contract.
There continues to be a small amount of exports by the group but there is no material exchange rate risk associated with this.
Exemptions In reporting the numerical information below, the group has excluded short term debtors and creditors as provided for under the financial reporting standard.
