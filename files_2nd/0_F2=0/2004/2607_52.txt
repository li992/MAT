NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 31 Financial risk management Burberry Groups policies are as follows: Liquidity and treasury management Burberry Groups management seeks to reduce financial risk and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Burberry Groups treasury function does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
Currency risk management Burberry Groups management has monitored the desirability of hedging the profits and net assets of overseas subsidiaries when translated into Sterling for reporting purposes.
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose.
Burberry Groups profit and loss account is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, Burberry Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward exchange contracts.
Burberry Groups principal foreign currency denominated transactions arise from royalty income and the sale and purchase of overseas sourced products.
In the UK, Burberry Group manages these exposures, by the use of Yen and Euro forward exchange contracts for a period of 12 months in advance.
In addition, Burberry Groups overseas subsidiaries hedge the foreign currency element of their product purchases on a seasonal basis.
The hedging activity involves the use of spot and forward currency instruments.
