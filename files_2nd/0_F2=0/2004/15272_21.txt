18 Treasury The groups treasury operates procedures designed to reduce or eliminate financial risk and ensure that funds are available for current and future needs.
The policies are approved by the Board and the use of financial instruments is strictly controlled.
Yule Catto & Co plcs policy is to finance itself using a mixture of equity and debt instruments.
The groups principal financial instruments comprise borrowings, some cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The group also uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
As permitted by FRS13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than net currency disclosures.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile in order to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk The objective of the company is to meet financial commitments as and when they fall due.
The Board closely monitors liquidity through monthly management accounts.
At the year end, Yule Catto & Co plc had the following principal facilities: A committed 60 million syndicated bank revolving credit facility of 60m which expires in November 2009.
This new credit facility was negotiated in November 2004.
Unsecured loan notes totalling approximately 175 million raised from the US private placement market in 1999 and 2004.
With maturity between 2008 and 2016, these loan notes provide the groups long term requirements.
Please see note 17 for further details.
54 Yule Catto & Co plc 18 Treasury continued Foreign currency risk The group uses currency borrowings, forward contracts and currency swaps to hedge overseas net assets, which are predominantly denominated in euros.
Profit translation exposures are not hedged.
The group hedges currency transaction exposures at the point of confirmed order, using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The groups policy is, where practicable, to hedge all exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
Consequently, there are no material currency exposures to disclose 2003 none.
Interest rate risk profile Financial assets The group has no financial assets 2003 none, other than short-term debtors and cash at bank.
Financial liabilities After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the group, the currency and interest rate exposure of the group as at 31 December 2004 was: Weighted Floating Weighted average time Total rate Fixed rate average fixed for which borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate rate is fixed 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 000 000 000 % years Sterling 174,411 4,411 170,000 7.2 5.2 Euro currencies 23,741 1,746 25,487 5.1 0.9 Other 7,323 7,323 205,475 9,988 195,487 7.1 4.6 Weighted Floating Weighted average time Total rate Fixed rate average fixed for which borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate rate is fixed 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 000 000 000 % years Sterling 139,180 10,820 150,000 6.8 4.7 Euro currencies 36,632 2,874 33,758 5.1 1.5 Other 11,320 11,320 187,132 3,374 183,758 6.6 4.1 The floating rate borrowings comprise: sterling denominated bank borrowings that bear interest at rates based on LIBOR.
sterling denominated overdrafts that bear interest at rates based on the UK bank rate.
foreign currency predominantly euros denominated bank borrowings and overdrafts that bear interest at equivalent rates.
2004 2003 000 000 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: In one year or less on demand 26,210 34,271 In more than one year but not more than two years 13,407 In more than two years but not more than five years 71,871 72,701 In more than five years 107,394 66,753 205,475 187,132 Borrowing facilities The group has various undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
The facilities available at 31 December 2004 in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met were as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 Expiring in one year or less Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 55,000 60,000 55,000 60,000 In addition to the committed facilities, the group has 57.6m 2003 60.9m of undrawn overdraft facilities.
55 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements 31 December 2004 continued 18 Treasury continued Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the groups financial assets and liabilities.
The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the loans of 19,458,000, 2003 9,297,000 reflects the revaluation of the Private Placement loan notes.
The loan notes are hedged using currency swaps and the carrying value and fair value of the currency element of these differ by an equal and opposite amount.
Gains and losses on hedges There are no unrecognised gains and losses on the foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2004 2003 none.
The interest rate and currency swaps in place are an integral part of the groups interest rate hedging strategy and as such there is no intention to cancel these contracts before maturity.
In the hypothetical event that the contracts had been cancelled at 31 December 2004, the net compensation payable would have been 16,721,000 2003 net compensation receivable 4,283,000.
During the year the effect of the hedging undertaken has been a debit of 1,041,000 2003 debit of 791,000 to the groups profit and loss account.
The hedging undertaken ensures that a substantial proportion of the groups interest charge for 2005 and beyond is known with certainty.
Should variable rates remain constant, the debit to the profit and loss account in 2005 in respect of the groups obligations under hedging contracts will be 1,558,000.
If variable interest rates decrease, the debit to the profit and loss account in 2005 in respect of the groups obligations under the hedging contracts will increase accordingly.

31 Pension commitments The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
UK pension schemes The group participates in a funded Scheme with both a defined benefit and defined contribution section the Yule Catto Group Retirement Benefit Scheme.
The Schemes defined benefit section was closed to new members with effect from 31 December 1998 and with effect from 1 January 1999 a defined contribution section was introduced and is open to all eligible group employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the companies concerned.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives within the group.
Contributions to the defined benefit scheme are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was at 6 April 2003.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increases in salaries and pensions.
For non-retired members it was assumed the investment return would be 7.5% pa and that salaries would increase at 3.5% pa. For retired members it was assumed that the investment return would be 5.75% pa, and for all members it was assumed that all pensions for which increases were due would increase at the rate of 2.5% pa, or such higher amount as guaranteed by the Scheme Rules.
Assets were taken into account at market value.
At the date of the actuarial valuation the market value of the assets of the UK Scheme was 102,574,435.
On the basis described above, the assets attributable to accrued defined benefits were assessed as being sufficient to cover 61.2% of the value of the benefits accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
In line with the recommendations from the Scheme actuary, annual contributions to the main UK Scheme have increased to 36.7% with effect from 1 October 2003.
