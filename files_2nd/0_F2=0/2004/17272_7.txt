Statement of Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently, with the exception of the changes arising on the adoption of new accounting standards as explained on page 30 under Accounting Policies: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and Group will continue in business.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonable to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Financial information is published on the Companys website.
The maintenance and integrity of this website is the responsibility of the Directors: the work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may occur to the financial statements after they are initially presented on the website.
It should be noted that legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
