Derivative instruments that are currently used by the Group are interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and short term currency swaps.
These instruments are used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange and commodity price risk.
The forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge future transaction ows.
The resulting gains and losses are recognised as they arise and offset against gains and losses in the related underlying exposure.
The interest rate differentials from interest rate swaps used to manage the amounts and periods for which interest rates on underlying debt is fixed are recorded through an adjustment of net interest payable.
Commodity forwards are used to hedge the future transaction flows arising from the sale of precious metals produced as a by-product of film processing.
The underlying principal amounts of short term currency swaps are revalued at the exchange rates as at the balance sheet date and included in current asset investments or creditors to the extent that they are not related to underlying debt.
The interest rate element of these contracts is recognised as part of net interest payable over the term of the agreement.
