Auditors remuneration for the Companys statutory audit was 0.3m 2003: 0.3m.
The fees for further assurance services principally related to due diligence and other duties carried out in respect of the acquisition of businesses.
The Company believes that, given their detailed knowledge of the Groups operations, its structure and accounting policies and the importance of carrying out detailed due diligence as part of the acquisition process, it is appropriate for this additional work to be carried out by the Companys auditors rather than another firm of accountants.
The Audit Committee, which consists entirely of independent non-executive directors, reviews and approves the level and type of non-audit work which the auditors perform, including the fees paid for such work, thus ensuring that their objectivity and independence is not compromised.

21 Bunzl plc Notes to the financial statements continued 22 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The funds of the principal schemes are administered by trustees and are held independently from the Group.
Pension costs of defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Full triennial actuarial valuations were carried out on the principal European defined benefit schemes in April 2003 and annual actuarial valuations are performed on the principal US defined benefit schemes.
Contributions to all schemes are determined in line with actuarial advice, local conditions and practices.
The most recent actuarial valuations have incorporated the requirements of FRS17 Retirement Benefits in assessing scheme liabilities at 31 December.
Scheme assets for the purpose of FRS17 are stated at their market value at 31 December.
The Group accounts for pension costs in accordance with FRS17.
As the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, the Company treats contributions to defined benefit schemes as if they were contributions to a defined contribution scheme in accordance with the exemption permitted by FRS17.
The Group operates other schemes overseas in accordance with local practice and legislation.
Some of these schemes are externally funded, while others are internally funded.
The amounts included in the financial statements are as follows: 2004 2003 Amounts charged to operating profit m m Defined contribution schemes 8.6 8.0 Defined benefit schemes: Service cost 7.4 7.0 Settlement 1.3 Total operating charge 16.0 13.7 Amounts included as other finance costs income Expected return on scheme assets 16.0 12.7 Interest on scheme liabilities 16.6 14.8 Net financial return 0.6 2.1 Total charge to operating profit 16.6 15.8 2004 2003 Amounts recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses m m Actual return less expected return on scheme assets 7.8 24.8 Experience loss on scheme liabilities 3.6 7.4 Impact of changes in assumptions relating to the present value of scheme liabilities 17.5 16.5 Actuarial loss gain 13.3 0.9 22 Bunzl plc 22 Pensions continued The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of FRS17 were: Europe US 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 3.75% 3.75% 3.25% 4.0% 5.0% 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 2.75% 2.75% 2.25% Discount rate 5.3% 5.5% 5.5% 6.0% 6.25% 6.75% Inflation rate 2.75% 2.75% 2.25% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

Acquisitions have been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and contributed 12.3m to operating profit in 2004.
On acquisition the assets and liabilities of the businesses acquired were adjusted to reflect their fair values to the Group.
The fair value adjustments are provisional and will be finalised in the 2005 financial statements.
The principal fair value adjustments are as follows: The adjustments to tangible fixed assets, stocks, debtors and creditors reflect their estimated realisable or settlement value.
The adjustment to provisions for liabilities and charges includes amounts relating to the reassessment of potential liabilities that were not fully recognised on acquisition.
The adjustment to deferred taxation reflects the recognition of a deferred taxation asset for anticipated relief on fair value adjustments.

29 Post balance sheet events The Board has decided to demerge the Filtrona business area from the Group.
It is planned to achieve this by paying the existing shareholders of the Company a dividend in specie thus creating Filtrona as an independent public company, while the Group will then become a simpler organisation concentrating on the Outsourcing Services business area.
It is expected that the process of demerger, which will be subject to shareholder approval, will be completed by June 2005.
