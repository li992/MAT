Principal Accounting Policies Basis of preparation These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The Xstrata plc Group the Group has adopted the following principal accounting policies: Basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Xstrata plc and its subsidiaries.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passes.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and are jointly controlled by the Group and one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement are treated as joint ventures.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group proportion of turnover, operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest expense, taxation, gross assets and gross liabilities of joint ventures the gross equity method.
Entities, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies the Group exercises a significant influence are treated as associates.
The consolidated financial statements include the Group proportion of the operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest expense, taxation and net assets of associates the equity method.
The Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
The financial statements include the Groups share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro-rata to the Groups interest in the joint arrangement.
On the acquisition of a subsidiary, or of an interest in a joint venture, associate, or joint arrangement, the purchase consideration is allocated to the assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
Those mineral reserves and resources that are able to be reliably valued are recognised in the assessment of fair values on acquisition.
Other potential reserves, resources and mineral rights, for which in the Directors opinion, values cannot be reliably determined, are not recognised.
When the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the Groups share of the identifiable net assets the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
This is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum life of 20 years.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction or, where forward cover contracts have been arranged, at the rate specified in the forward contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at year end exchange rates, or where there are related forward contracts, at the rate specified in the forward contract.
On consolidation, profit and loss account items are translated at average rates of exchange.
Balance sheet items are translated at year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on the re-translation of the investments in overseas subsidiaries, joint arrangements, joint ventures and associates at closing rates, together with differences between profit and loss accounts translated at average and at closing rates, are dealt with in reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings financing those net investments, are also dealt with in reserves.
All other exchange differences are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.

Principal Accounting Policies continued The following exchange rates have been applied: 31 December Average 2004 31 December Average 2003 2004 12 months 2003 12 months Argentine pesos ARS 2.9720 2.9416 2.9375 2.9486 Australian dollars AUD 0.7802 0.7370 0.7520 0.6494 Chile pesos CLP 557.40 611.45 595.00 686.99 Euros EUR 1.3554 1.2442 1.2601 1.1302 Great Britain pounds GBP 1.9179 1.8335 1.7857 1.6340 South African rands ZAR 5.6650 6.4341 6.6843 7.5391 Swiss francs CHF 1.1403 1.2421 1.2391 1.3442 Turnover Revenues associated with the sales of commodities are recognised when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred to the customer, usually when the commodity is delivered to the shipping agent.
Turnover is recognised at invoiced amounts, with most sales being priced free on board FOB, free on rail FOR or cost, insurance and freight CIF.
Revenues from the sales of by-products are also included in turnover.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents product cost, determined by means of either the weighted average or first in first out FIFO method, and by applying full absorption costing of mining, processing and smelting overheads, plus any other costs directly attributed to the acquisition of materials.
Investments The investments in the rehabilitation trust funds are measured at fair value based on the market price of the investments held by the trust fund.
Other investments are carried at cost less any provision for impairments.
Intangible assets Intangible assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill if the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition, subject to the constraint that, unless the asset has a readily ascertainable market value, the fair value is limited to an amount that does not create or increase any negative goodwill arising on the acquisition.
Intangible assets are amortised using a straight-line method based on estimated useful lives, except those intangible assets which the Directors regard as having indefinite useful lives, which are not amortised but are reviewed for impairment annually.
Tangible assets Land and buildings, plant and equipment The cost of each item of buildings, plant and equipment is depreciated over its useful life.
Mine production assets are depreciated using a unit of production method based on estimated economically recoverable reserves, which results in a depreciation charge proportional to the depletion of reserves.
Tangible assets unrelated to production are depreciated using the straight-line method based on estimated useful lives.
Each items estimated useful life has due regard to both its own physical life limitations and the present assessment of economically recoverable reserves of the mine property or plantation at which the item is located, and to possible future variations in those assessments.
Estimates of remaining useful lives are made on a regular basis for all mine buildings, machinery and equipment, with annual reassessments for major items.
Changes in estimates which affect unit of production calculations are accounted for prospectively.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Principal Accounting Policies continued The expected useful lives are as follows: Buildings 15 40 years Plant and Equipment 4 30 years Furniture and Fixtures 5 15 years Other 3 5 years The net carrying amounts of mine buildings, machinery and equipment at each mine property are reviewed regularly and, to the extent to which these values exceed their recoverable amounts, that excess is fully provided against in the financial year in which this is determined.
Plantations Plantations are recorded at cost.
Development costs, interest and financing costs relating to the development of the plantations are deferred and amortised upon commencement of production, on a unit of production method based on the estimated future production from each plantation.
Exploration and evaluation expenditure Exploration and evaluation expenditure for each area of interest, other than that acquired from the purchase of another mining company, is carried forward as an asset provided that one of the following conditions is met: such costs are expected to be recouped through successful development and exploration of the area of interest or alternatively, by its sale: or exploration and evaluation activities in the area of interest have not yet reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessment of the existence or otherwise of economically recoverable reserves, and active and significant operations in relation to the area are continuing.
Exploration expenditure which fails to meet at least one of the conditions outlined above is written-off.
Identifiable exploration and evaluation assets acquired are recognised as assets at their cost of acquisition.
Exploration assets are reassessed on a regular basis and these costs are carried forward provided that at least one of the conditions outlined above is met.
Mineral properties and mine development expenditure Costs of acquiring mineral properties are capitalised on the balance sheet in the year in which they are incurred.
Capitalised costs development expenditure include interest and financing costs relating to the construction of plant and equipment and costs associated with a start up period where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Mineral properties and capitalised costs are, upon commencement of production, amortised using a unit of production method based on the estimated economically recoverable reserves to which they relate or are written-off if the property is abandoned or where there is an impairment in value.
0147 Xstrata AR 2005 103-139 29 3 05 11:55 am Page 106 106 | Xstrata plc Annual Report 2004 notes to the financial statements 1.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Leasing and hire purchase commitments Assets held under finance leases, where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group, and hire purchase contracts are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital elements of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged in the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Capital work in progress Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the capital work in progress account.
On completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of tangible fixed assets.
The cost of a tangible fixed asset comprises its purchase price and any costs directly attributable to bringing it into working condition for its intended use.
Costs associated with a start up period are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels without a commissioning period.
Capital work in progress is not depreciated.
Impairment The carrying amounts of fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an exercise is undertaken to determine whether the carrying values are in excess of their recoverable amount.
Such review is undertaken on income generating units.
If the carrying amount of a fixed asset exceeds the recoverable amount, a provision is recorded to reflect the asset at the lower amount.
In assessing recoverable amount for fixed assets, the relevant future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of such assets and from their disposal have been discounted to their present value using a market-determined discount rate.
Deferred overburden removal expenditure In open pit mining operations, it is necessary to remove overburden and other waste in order to access the ore body.
During the pre-production phase, these costs are capitalised as part of the cost of the mine property.
The cost of removal of the waste material during a mines production phase is deferred, where appropriate.
The deferral of these costs, and subsequent charges in the profit and loss account are determined with reference to the mines strip ratio.
This ratio represents the ratio of the estimated total volume of waste, to the estimated total quantity of economically recoverable ore, over the life of the mine.
Deferral of these costs is made where the actual stripping ratios vary from the mines strip ratio.
The costs charged in the profit and loss account are based on application of the mine strip ratio to the quantity of ore mined in the period.
Where the ore is expected to be evenly distributed, waste removal is expensed as incurred.
Principal Accounting Policies continued Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs incurred in the normal course of business in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
Stocks are categorised, as follows: raw materials and consumables: Materials, goods or supplies including energy sources to be either directly or indirectly consumed in the production process.
work in progress: Items stored in an intermediate state that have not yet passed through all the stages of production.
finished goods: Products and materials that have passed all stages of the production process.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less any further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Capital grants Government grants in respect of capital expenditure are credited to a deferred income account and are released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets by equal annual instalments.
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to income so as to match them with the expenditure to which they relate.
Potential liabilities to repay grants either in whole or in part are provided for to the extent that the repayment is probable.
Environmental protection, rehabilitation and closure costs Provision is made for close down, restoration and for environmental rehabilitation costs which include the dismantling and demolition of infrastructure, removal of residual materials and remediation of disturbed areas in the accounting period when the related environmental disturbance occurs, based on the estimated future costs.
The provision is discounted where material and the unwinding of the discount is included in interest payable.
At the time of establishing the provision, a corresponding asset is capitalised where it gives rise to a future benefit and depreciated over future production from the mine to which it relates.
The provision does not include allowances for unforeseeable events.
The provision is reviewed on an annual basis for changes in cost estimates or life of operations.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated will be required to settle the obligation.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future.
In particular: provision is made for tax on gains arising from the disposal of fixed assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold: provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas entities only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable: and deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that, it is considered that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Principal Accounting Policies continued Derivative instruments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
The Group may use forward, swap, option and collar contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks movements.
Hedge accounting is applied whereby gains and losses on these contracts are recognised in the period to which the gains and losses of the underlying transactions relate.
Where the underlying transaction can no longer be identified, gains or losses on the hedge contract are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where the hedge contracts are terminated early and the underlying transaction can no longer be identified, the gain or loss on the terminated hedge contract is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, the gain or loss on the terminated hedge transaction is deferred until the underlying transaction occurs.
Pensions and other post-retirement obligations The Groups contributions to its defined contribution pension plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which they relate.
The Group contributes to separately administered funds for its defined benefit pension plans and the pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the employees working lives within the Group.
The regular cost is attributed to individual years using the projected unit method.
Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged in the profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The Group also provides post retirement healthcare benefits to certain employees in South Africa.
The estimated cost of providing such benefits is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the employees working lives within the Group.
Capital instruments Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and if not they are included in shareholders funds.
Financial liabilities Loans are recognised at inception at the fair value of the proceeds received net of issue costs.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account is allocated to periods over the term of the loan at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred, except that development expenditure incurred on an individual project is carried forward when its future recoverability can reasonably be regarded as assured.
Any expenditure carried forward is amortised in line with the expected future sales from the related project.
Change of accounting policies As a result of the implementation of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, Own shares of US$40.8 million 2003 US$40.8 million for the Group and US$32.9 million 2003 US$32.9 million for the Company have been re-classified from Other investments to within equity in the Balance Sheet.
There has been no impact on results in the current or prior periods.
Comparatives Where applicable, comparatives have been adjusted to disclose them on the same basis as current period figures.
Use of estimates The preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting practice requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual outcomes could differ from these estimates.
Changes in Group Companies Acquisitions Cook Resources Mining Pty Ltd On 22 April 2004, the Group acquired a further 45% interest in Cook Resources Mining Pty Ltd in Australia for US$6.3 million from Centinal Coal Company Limited by assuming a US$6.3 million of shareholder loans from the vendor, increasing the percentage ownership to 95%.
Pooling and Sharing Venture On 1 July 2004, the Group established a joint venture with Merafe Resources Ltd formerly SA Chrome & Alloys Limited.
The Group and Merafe Resources Ltd Merafe will retain legal ownership of their respective assets, mining rights and land, with both parties undertaking to contribute to the venture the right to use all such assets in the ratio 82.5% 17.5%, in exchange for set interest participations in the pooled EBITDA as follows: Xstrata Merafe Year 1 89.0% 11.0% Year 2 86.0% 14.0% Year 3 onwards 82.5% 17.5% Merafe has an option, exercisable for one year, to acquire an additional 2.5% in the venture at a value of US$11 million per percentage point.

To the extent there is a difference between pension cost and contributions paid, a prepayment or creditor arises.
The accumulated difference provided in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 gives rise to a creditor of US$0.3 million 2003 creditor of US$0.6 million.
The assets are held separately from those of the Group, being generally invested with insurance companies and regulated by local legislation.
In general, these pension plans provide benefits to participants at retirement or other life contingencies.
The benefits vary from severance payments to retirement pensions on termination of employment.
On retirement or other legitimate life contingency, the employees are eligible to a severance lump sum payment or an annuity equal in value to their share of the fund.
Post-retirement Medical Plans The Group also operates unfunded post-retirement medical benefits in South Africa.
Independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit method assess the accumulated benefit obligation and annual cost of accrued benefits.
The accumulated benefit obligation calculated as at 31 December 2004 was US$12.6 million 2003 US$8.6 million and has been included in the accounts.
Defined Benefit Pension Plans The Group had two defined benefit plans in the United Kingdom and one plan in Australia.

Independent professionally qualified actuaries assess the pension costs and funding of these plans using the projected unit method.
The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2004.

At 31 December 2004 the estimated market value of the assets of the funded pension plans under FRS 17 was US$166.3 million 2003 US$115.2 million and the market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 96.9% 2003: 76.7% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
The date of the most recent FRS 17 valuation was 31 December 2004.
The full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 has been delayed until periods beginning 1 January 2005 but additional disclosures are required in the current year, which are shown below.
The standard requires pension deficits and surpluses to be recognised in full.
Annual service cost and net financial income on the assets and liabilities of the plans are recognised through earnings.
Other fluctuations in the value of the surplus deficits are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

Financial Instruments The Group is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates in the normal course of business.
Derivative transactions are entered into solely to hedge these risks.
Market fluctuations in derivative financial instruments designated as hedges are used to offset the fluctuations in the underlying exposure.
With the exception of the net foreign currency monetary receivable exposures, the disclosures below exclude short-term trading related debtor and creditor balances.
Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to fluctuations in commodity prices, with the commodity mix spread fairly evenly between those which are priced by reference to prevailing market prices on terminal markets and those that are set on a contract basis with customers, generally on an annual basis.
Due to the volatile nature of commodity prices and the historical relationship between prices and the currencies of most of the countries where the Group operates, hedging may be entered into only in limited circumstances and subject to strict limits laid down by the Board.
Credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of trade receivables, however, given the geographical and industry spread of the Groups customers, credit risk is believed to be limited.
The Group has established credit limits so that dealings are with a wide range reputable bank and financial institutions on a competitive basis.
Interest rate risk of financial assets and liabilities The Group normally borrows and invests at floating rates of interest.
A limited amount of fixed rate hedging can be undertaken during periods where the Groups exposure to movements in short term interest rates is more significant.
The 2010 guaranteed convertible bonds was initially swapped to a floating rate of interest, but the first 2 years of floating rate payments were subsequently swapped back to a fixed interest rate.

Financial Instruments continued Currency risk Owing to the Groups significant operations in Australia, South Africa and Spain, the balance sheet and results can be affected significantly by movements in exchange rates.
The reporting currency of the Group is the US$, as this is the underlying economic currency of the Groups cash flows and the majority of borrowings are denominated in US$.
However, overseas operations undertake the majority of transactions and have cash flows in local currencies.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures: in other words, those transactional or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
As at 31 December, the net foreign currency monetary receivable exposure primarily US$ is as follows: US$m 2004 2003 Functional currency: AUD 102.9 17.4 EUR 9.6 3.7 US$ 5.6 7.6 ZAR 44.1 98.6 Other 3.8 0.7 135.6 120.6 The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of foreign currency contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
Foreign currency hedges The Australian operations have entered into AUD US$ exchange contracts to hedge their US dollar denominated revenue and third party loans whilst the Spanish operations have entered into EUR US$ exchange contracts to hedge a portion of their US dollar denominated revenue.
The Group will also enter into forward contracts to hedge specific one off foreign currency risks.
