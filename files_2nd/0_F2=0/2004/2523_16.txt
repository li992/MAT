123 million of the deferred tax credit was treated as an exceptional item.

These losses can be offset only against taxable profits generated in the entities concerned.
Although the Directors ultimately expect sufficient profits to arise, there is currently insufficient evidence to support recognition of a deferred tax asset relating to these losses.
The losses are available to be carried forward indefinitely under current law.
A deferred tax asset of 64 million 2003: 64 million has not been recognised in respect of trading losses in the Groups German holding companies of KirchPayTV, and a deferred tax asset of 450 million 2003: 450 million has not been recognised in respect of potential capital losses related to the Groups holding of KirchPayTV on the basis that these timing differences are not more likely than not to reverse.
A deferred tax asset of 6 million 2003: 5 million arising principally on other timing differences has not been recognised, on the basis that these timing differences are not more likely than not to reverse.
The Group has realised and unrealised capital losses in respect of football club and other investments estimated to be in excess of 21 million 2003: 28 million which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset, on the basis that they are not more likely than not to be utilised and thus reverse.

In accordance with FRS 11, impairment reviews were performed on the carrying values of BiB and SIG goodwill balances at the end of the first full financial year after acquisition, at 30 June 2002, which did not indicate impairment.
Consistent with Group strategy, the business plans on which these reviews were based reflect significant projected increases in betting and other interactive revenues over the subsequent five years.
The Group continues to monitor the performance of these businesses and is satisfied that no impairment of goodwill has occurred.
At 30 June 2004, the Group made a provision of 3 million, included within amortisation, against goodwill which arose on the acquisition of Planetfootball.
com Limited a company which provides website services to the sports industry, reducing the carrying value to nil.
The provision was made as a result of an impairment review which showed that the expected future cash flows of the business would not support a carrying value for the goodwill.

This facility was used to cancel a 750 million RCF, which had been agreed in July 1999, and can be used for general corporate purposes.
The 600 million facility has a maturity date of March 2008, and interest accrues at a margin of between 0.600% and 1.125% above the London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR, dependent on the Groups Net debt: EBITDA leverage ratio as defined in the loan agreement.
Until June 2004, the margin was fixed at 1.125%, and shall not fall below 0.700% per annum above LIBOR prior to March 2006.
Also in March 2003, the Group voluntarily cancelled 100 million of the 300 million March 2001 RCF.
The remaining 200 million RCF expired without being renewed on 29 June 2004. b Guaranteed notes At 30 June 2004, the Group also had in issue the following publicly-traded guaranteed notes: US$650 million of 8.200% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in July 2009.
At the time of issuing these notes, the US dollar proceeds were swapped into pounds sterling 413 million at an average fixed rate of 7.653% payable semi-annually.
In December 2002, March 2003 and July 2003, the Group entered into further swap arrangements relating to 63.5 million of this debt, the effect of which was to fix the interest rate on 63.5 million at 5.990% until January 2004, after which time it reverted to floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 2.840%, except that should LIBOR be less than 2.750% for the period January to July 2004, 2.890% for the period July 2004 to January 2005, or 2.990% thereafter, the effective rate shall be deemed to be 7.653%.
In order to increase its exposure to floating rates, in August 2003, the Group entered into another interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of a further 63.5 million of the above-mentioned debt, the effect of which was that, from July 2003 until July 2009, the Group will pay floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 2.8175% on this 63.5 million, except that should LIBOR be less than 2.750% for the period January to July 2004, or less than 2.990% thereafter, the Group shall revert back to 7.653%.
At 30 June 2004, none of the floor levels had been breached, therefore the Group continues to pay the relevant floating rates.
100 million of 7.750% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in July 2009.
The fixed coupon is payable annually.
In March 2004, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in respect of 50 million of this debt, whereby the previously fixed rate of 7.750% was swapped to a floating rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 2.050% from July 2004 to July 2005.
On 9 July 2005, and every 9 July thereafter, the counterparty has the right, but not the obligation, to cancel this swap, returning the Group to its previous fixed rate of 7.750%.
US$600 million of 6.875% Guaranteed Notes, repayable in February 2009.
At the time of issuing these notes, the US dollar proceeds were swapped into pounds sterling 367 million at an average fixed rate of 8.200%, payable semi-annually.
In July 2003, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of 61.2 million of this swapped debt.
The effect of this new hedging arrangement was that, from July 2003 until February 2009, the Group will pay floating six months LIBOR plus a margin of 3.490% on 61.2 million of its swapped debt.
However, at each six monthly reset date, the counterparty to this transaction has the right to cancel the transaction with immediate effect.
In October 2003, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement in respect of a further 61.2 million of this swapped debt, the effect of which was to reduce the rate payable to 7.950% for the period August 2003 to February 2004.
Thereafter, until August 2006, the rate payable is 7.950% plus any margin by which the floating six monthly LIBOR reset rate exceeds the sum of the previous reset rate plus 0.500%.
Thereafter, the rate reverts to a fixed 8.180%.
US$300 million of 7.300% Guaranteed Notes repayable in October 2006.
At the time of issuing these notes, the Group entered into swap transactions to convert the dollar proceeds to pounds sterling 189 million, half of which carries a fixed rate of interest of 8.384% until maturity, payable semi-annually.
The remainder was fixed at 7.940% until 15 April 2002, thereafter floating at 0.620% over six months LIBOR, again payable semi-annually.
In respect of this remaining floating exposure, on 16 January 2002, the Group entered into a further interest rate hedging arrangement to fix the rate at 6.130% from 15 April 2002, payable semi-annually for the remainder of the life of the notes.
Both the bank facilities and the publicly-traded guaranteed notes have been issued by the Company and guaranteed by both British Sky Broadcasting Limited and Sky Subscribers Services Limited.

The fair values of other borrowings are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present value.
The fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated by calculating the differences between the contracted rates and the appropriate market rates prevailing at the period-ends.
The differences between book values and fair values reflect unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instruments, based on valuations as at 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.
In addition to the financial instruments in the above fair value table, the Group had holdings in the equity share capital of other listed investments at 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003.
See notes 13 and 14 for disclosure of their book values and fair values.

The reduction had the effect of eliminating the Companys deficit on its profit and loss account as at 30 September 2003 of 1,106 million, and creating a non-distributable special reserve of 14 million, which represents the excess of the share premium reduction over the deficit.
Share option schemes During the period the Company issued shares with a market value of 26 million 2003: 6 million in respect of the exercise of options awarded under various share option schemes, with 20 million 2003: 5 million received from employees.

In addition, the brought forward profit and loss reserve at 1 July 2003 was reduced by 12 million.
The impact of adopting UITF 38 was accordingly to reduce net assets at 1 July 2003 by 47 million, and to reduce profit for the year to 30 June 2003 by 6 million see note 1.
The movement in the ESOP shares held was as follows: Number of Group Ordinary Shares m Beginning of year 5,457,012 35 Share options exercised during the year 4,339,497 27 Shares repurchased by the Group during the year 3,630,000 22 End of year 4,747,515 30 Contingent consideration On 30 September 2003, the Company issued 338,755 2003: nil Ordinary Shares to satisfy the remaining contingent consideration in respect of the acquisition of the remaining 5% interest in WAPTV Limited which occurred in May 2001.

These included the waiver of the selling shareholders rights under the earn out provisions.
The earn out provisions provided that if the valuation of BiB was 3 billion or more in January or July 2003, further contingent consideration would have been payable to the selling shareholders.

66 Annual Report and Accounts 2004 British Sky Broadcasting Group plc Notes to Financial Statements continued 24 Guarantees, contingencies and other financial commitments a Future expenditure Group Group 2004 2003 m m Contracted for but not provided for in the accounts Television programme rights i 2,489 1,618 Set-top boxes and related equipment 70 106 Third party payments ii 41 46 Capital expenditure 17 3 Other purchase obligations 61 7 2,678 1,780 i Of the commitments for television programme rights, 766 million 2003: 692 million related to commitments payable in US dollars for periods of up to nine years 2003: ten years, 87 million 2003: 136 million related to commitments payable in Swiss francs for periods of up to two years 2003: three years and 6 million 2003: nil related to commitments payable in Euros for periods of up to two years.
To hedge a proportion of these commitments, at 30 June 2004, the Group had outstanding forward rate contracts to purchase, in aggregate, US$705 million 2003: US$903 million at an average rate of US$1.6227:1 2003: US$1.4925:1 and CHF90 million 2003: CHF99 million at an average rate of CHF2.2899:1 and CHF1.5099:Euro 1 2003: CHF2.0834:1 and CHF1.4844:Euro 1.
At 30 June 2004, the US dollar television programme rights commitments have been translated at the year end rate of US$1.8219:1 2003: US$1.6497:1, except for US$340 million 2003: US$566 million covered by forward rate contracts where the average forward rate set out above has been used.
The Swiss franc commitments have been translated at the year end rate of CHF2.2743:1 2003: CHF2.2288: 1 except for CHF90 million 2003: CHF99 million covered by forward rate contracts where the average forward rates set out above have been used.

Certain of the US dollar commitments disclosed above are subject to price escalation clauses in accordance with the terms of certain of the movie programme rights contracts and are for periods of up to six years 2003: six years.
The extent of the escalation, and hence of the commitments, is dependent both upon the number of DTH subscribers to the relevant movie channel and, in certain cases, upon inflationary increases.
If subscriber numbers were to remain at 30 June 2004 levels, the additional commitment in respect of subscriber escalation would be 265 million US$483 million 2003: 213 million US$351 million.
The pounds sterling television programme rights commitments include similar price escalation clauses that would result in additional commitments of 3 million 2003: nil if subscriber numbers were to remain at 30 June 2004 levels.

The extent of the escalation, and hence of the commitments, is dependent upon the number of DTH subscribers to the relevant Sky Distributed channels and, in certain cases, upon inflationary increases.
If both the DTH subscriber levels to these channels and the rate payable for each Sky Distributed channel were to remain at 30 June 2004 levels, the additional commitment in respect of subscriber escalation would be 844 million 2003: 799 million.
b Contingent liabilities The Group has contingent liabilities by virtue of its investments in unlimited companies, or partnerships, which include Nickelodeon UK, The History Channel UK, Paramount UK and National Geographic Channel.
The Directors do not expect any material loss to arise from the above contingent liabilities.

The fair value of the channels is to be determined at the earlier of contract termination and 30 June 2006.
Accordingly, it is not yet possible to determine the value of the payment to be received.

25 Regulatory update European Commission Investigation Football Association Premier League Limited On the basis of the performance by the Group of certain commitments given by the Group to the European Commission concerning the future retailing and wholesaling of the Groups channels featuring live Premier League coverage, the European Commission has confirmed in a comfort letter that it has fully and finally settled its investigations in connection with the Groups bids for all rights in relation to Premier League matches throughout the 2004 05 to 2006 07 Football Association Premier League FAPL seasons and any resulting agreements between the Group and the FAPL.
In accordance with its commitments to the European Commission, the Group conducted a tender process for a proposed sub-licence of six or eight live Premier League matches per season to another broadcaster.
On 12 May 2004, the Group announced that it had concluded the tender process and that none of the bids received had attained the reserve price per match which the Group had previously agreed with the European Commission.
The Group will not, therefore, sub-license those rights.
European Commission Investigation Movie Contracts The European Commission continues to investigate the terms on which movies produced by major US movie studios are supplied to distributors, including pay television operators, throughout the European Union.
The European Commission has not yet issued a Statement of Objections the document in which it sets out the grounds on which it considers the EU competition rules to have been breached to the studios.
The Group understands this has been delayed by procedural issues raised by a number of the studios.
The Group is co-operating with this investigation.
At this stage, the Group is unable to determine whether it will have a material effect on the Group.
European Commission Sector Inquiry New Media Sports Rights The European Commission has opened a sector inquiry regarding the conditions of provision of audio-visual content from sports events to internet and other new media companies such as 3G mobile operators.
The European Commission has stated that the purpose of its investigation is to gain as clear and wide a view as possible of the availability of audio-visual sports rights in the European Union, so as to ascertain whether access by new media operators to such content is not unduly restricted.
