18 Financial instruments The Groups objectives, policies and strategy in respect of risk management and the use of financial instruments are described in the Financial Review.
The following disclosures exclude all short term, trade related debtors and creditors.
Interest rate risks of financial assets and liabilities The interest rate profile, after taking into account interest and cross-currency swaps, of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group as at 31 December 2004 was: Financial Weighted Weighted assets liabilities average average on which fixed period for Floating Fixed no interest is interest which rate rate rate paid received Total rate is fixed $m $m $m $m %Years Financial liabilities US dollar 1,159 1,159 Other 13 13 1,172 1,172 Financial assets US dollar 4,772 10 4,782 Euro 4 4 Sterling 127 252 379 SEK 2 18 20 Other 228 228 5,133 280 5,413 The floating rate financial liabilities comprise largely of fixed rate debt that has been swapped into floating rate debt.
During the year, the Group restructured its external debt.
A $300m US dollar bond was partially re-purchased and cancelled, with the remaining balance swapped into floating rate until maturity.
In addition, the Group issued a $750m US dollar fixed rate bond under a $4bn SEC registered shelf programme.
The bond matures in 2014 and has been swapped to floating rate until maturity.
The financial liabilities also include $142m of short term bank borrowings and overdrafts, bearing interest at rates fixed by reference to local interbank rates.
The financial assets principally comprise cash on overnight deposit or held directly with third party fund managers and short term investments with an average maturity of 27 days.
These include deposits where the interest rate is fixed until maturity but, as the original maturity is less than one year, they are classified as floating rate financial instruments.
The main benchmark rates for euro and US dollar financial assets are the relevant LIBID rates.
Financial assets include $267m of other fixed asset investments on which no interest is received.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Financial Statements 92 Form 20-F Information 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 18 Financial instruments continued Currency exposures 100% of the Groups major transactional currency exposures on working capital balances, which typically extend for up to three months, are hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, as at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of the Group companies concerned, having taken into account the effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used to match foreign currency exposures.
Additionally, approximately 95% of forecast future foreign currency transaction exposures on major currencies extending for 12 months were hedged to cover movements outside specified limits.
The principal currency exposures sterling, Swedish kronor SEK and euros were hedged using a mixture of purchased currency options and forward foreign exchange contracts.
As at 31 December 2004, the forecast future foreign currency transaction exposures were: 2004 2003 Forecast Forecast exposures exposures $m $m Sterling payables 2,553 2,517 SEK payables 1,551 1,442 Euro receivables 1,926 2,194 Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short term creditors such as trade creditors and accruals, at 31 December 2004 was as follows: 2004 2003 Analysis by year of repayment Loans Other Total Loans Other Total $m $m $m $m $m $m After five years 1,030 1,030 303 303 From five to four years From four to three years From three to two years From two to one years Due after more than one year 1,030 1,030 303 303 Due within one year 142 142 152 152 1,030 142 1,172 303 152 455 Other financial liabilities comprise short term bank borrowings and overdrafts.

Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of carrying values and fair values of all the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.

Short term investments the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
For unlisted investments, carrying values approximate fair value.
Fixed asset investments excluding equity investments in joint ventures and associates the fair value of listed investments is based on year end quoted market prices.
c. Loans the fair value of publicly traded debt is based on year end quoted market prices: the fair value of floating rate debt is nominal value, as mark to market differences would be minimal given frequency of resets: the fair value of remaining debt is estimated using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
d. Forward foreign exchange contracts the Group has forward foreign exchange contracts to sell currency for the purpose of hedging non-dollar commercial transaction exposures which existed at the date of the balance sheet and to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, non-dollar commercial transactions for 2005.
The majority of the contracts for existing transactions had a maturity of six months or less from year end.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is based on market forward foreign exchange rates at year end.
e. Foreign currency option contracts the Group has foreign currency option contracts to hedge anticipated, but not firmly committed, non-dollar commercial transactions for 2005.
The fair value of option contracts is estimated using Black-Scholes valuation techniques.
f. Interest rate and cross-currency swaps AstraZeneca uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to hedge the Groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange movements on borrowings, in accordance with a formal risk management strategy.
The fair value is estimated using appropriate zero coupon valuation techniques based on rates current at year end.
The above financial instruments are subject to credit and market risk.
AstraZeneca contains credit risk through the use of counterparty and product specific credit limits and by ongoing review procedures.
All financial instruments are transacted with commercial banks and, in line with standard market practice, are not backed with cash collateral.
The notional principal values of off balance sheet financial instruments do not represent amounts exchanged by the parties and are not a measure of the credit risk to the Group of these instruments.
The credit risk of these instruments is limited to the positive fair values of such contracts.
Market risk is the sensitivity of the value of financial instruments to changes in related currency and interest rates.
The Group is not exposed to material market risk because gains and losses on the derivative financial instruments are largely offset by gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions subject to hedge.
Hedges As noted on page 92, the Groups policy is to hedge 100% of transactional currency exposures and approximately 95% of forecast future transaction exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency option contracts.
It also uses cross-currency and interest rate swaps to manage the profile of its borrowings.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains $m $m $m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 January 2004 129 21 108 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in 2004 105 21 84 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were not recognised in 2004 24 24 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2004 83 1 82 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 33 1 32 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 50 50
