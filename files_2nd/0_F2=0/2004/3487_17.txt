The weighted average interest rate on fixed rate borrowings is 10.68% 2003: 10.41% and the weighted average time for which the rate is fixed was 1.44 years 2003: 1.75 years.

The fair value of interest rate collars at 31st August 2004 indicated a technical deficit to the Group of 1,261,000 2003: 3,197,000 and arises because at the year-end, the prevailing interest rate had fallen below the contractual floor rate in the collar.
The fair value was calculated by reference to prevailing market interest rates.

32 Pension costs The UK Group operates a funded pension scheme with a final salary section and a defined contributions section.
The final salary section of the scheme was closed to new entrants after 1st July 1994.
Since that date, all eligible employees can choose to join the defined contribution section of the scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held under trust separately from the Companys assets, and are invested by external fund managers.
Contributions to the final salary section of the scheme are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method.
Contributions to the defined contributions section depend on the age of the employee.
The most recent actuarial valuation, as at 1st September 2002, showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 16,393,000 and the actuarial value of those assets represented 77% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The deficit amounting to 4,975,000, which relates entirely to the final salary section of the scheme, is being funded by temporarily increased contributions by the Group of 393,000 per annum, in addition to the employers contribution rate of 24.2% for the remaining members of the final salary section of the scheme.
The key assumptions affecting the results of the 1st September 2002 valuation were: investment returns would be 5.0% per annum previously 7.5% per annum salary increases would average 3.5% per annum previously 5.5% per annum The pension charge for the year was 1,022,000 2003: 1,131,000, after allowing for nil 2003: 187,000 in respect of the amortisation of past service surpluses that are being recognised over the average remaining service lives of employees.
At 31st August 2004, the outstanding pension contributions relating to the final salary section of the Scheme were 52,233 2003: 59,637.
