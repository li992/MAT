Contingent liabilities & guarantees Group Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Maximum guarantee obligations relating to bank and other borrowings of subsidiaries and a joint venture 14,297 4,054 Guarantees and indemnities have been given in respect of the performance of Devonport Royal Dockyard Limited.
The company and certain subsidiaries had other contingent liabilities in the normal course of business, including counter indemnities for performance and tendering bonds of certain subsidiaries.
The company and certain subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the normal course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Post balance sheet events On 1 February 2005, the Group took the decision to relocate its UK Valve business and to radically restructure its product portfolio and operational procedures.
On 17 March 2005, the Group also took the decision to refocus its Clear Liquid product portfolio and to exit certain product lines.
Both of these decisions will involve a significant downsizing of the respective workforces at those facilities, the extent of which will depend on the outcome of statutory employee consultation periods.
Until the outcome of these consultations is known, the exact shape and size of the restructurings cannot be accurately determined and the directors are therefore unable to reliably assess the financial impact of them.
However, based upon the financial information currently available, it appears that these restructurings are likely to involve exceptional re-organisation costs in the order of 31,000,000.
