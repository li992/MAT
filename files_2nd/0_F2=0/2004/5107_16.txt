Notes forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the consolidated financial statements of the Group.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
Implementation of UITF 38 The Accounting Standards Board issued UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts in December 2003.
The abstract is effective for accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2004.
The abstract requires that shares which have been issued, but which are held by the employee share trusts, are deducted from equity rather than shown as an asset on the balance sheet.
As a result, an adjustment of 0.4 million has been made in the prior year to restate 195,737 shares previously disclosed within debtors.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account in either the current or prior financial year.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of the holding company and its subsidiaries for the years made up to 30 September 2004 and 2003.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The Companys loss for the financial year was 1.3 million 2003: loss of 8.1 million.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a business fair values are attributed to the separable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arises where the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs for a business exceeds the fair value of such net assets.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over its estimated useful life, not to exceed 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Associates and joint ventures An associate is an undertaking, not being a subsidiary, in which the Group holds a long-term interest and over whose commercial and financial policy decisions it actually exercises significant influence.
The Groups share of the profit less losses from its associate is included in the consolidated profit and loss account on the equity accounting basis.
The carrying value of associates in the Groups balance sheet is calculated by reference to the Groups share of the net assets of such undertakings.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the profits and losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost plus capitalised interest.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount, an impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Revenue Revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline services, net of passenger taxes, discounts, including internet booking discounts, plus ancillary and advertising revenue.
Revenue from the sale of flight seats is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in creditors, within accruals and deferred income.
Refunds made to passengers in the pre-flight period are recorded as reductions in revenue and any refunds made post flight are ordinarily recorded as marketing expense in the profit and loss account.
58 Annual report and accounts 2004 1 Accounting policies continued Ancillary revenues comprising principally commissions, change fees and credit card fees are recognised as revenue on the date that the right to receive consideration occurs.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives to the Group over the following periods: Period of depreciation Residual value Boeing 737-300 aircraft 7 years $12 million to $13 million Airbus A319 aircraft 7 years $20 million Aircraft improvement 3-7 years Nil Aircraft prepaid maintenance 3-10 years Nil Aircraft spares 10 years from date of purchase Nil Leasehold improvements 5 years Nil Fixtures, fittings and equipment 3 years Nil Computer hardware and software 3 years Nil The aircraft which the Group hold are expected to have an operational life of 20-30 years.
However, the Group has a policy of using recently manufactured aircraft and, therefore, expects to hold them only for a period of approximately seven years before selling them.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance of its engines and airframe and is amortised over a period ranging from three to ten years from the date of manufacture.
Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines are capitalised and amortised over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements.
All other costs relating to maintenance are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The cost of new Airbus aircraft comprises the invoiced price of the aircraft from the supplier less the estimated value of other assets received by easyJet for no consideration in connection with the transaction to purchase aircraft.
Principal assets received for no consideration in connection with the acquisition of aircraft include the following: l Cash The cash received is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet.
The corresponding credits are treated as a discount and spread equally across each of the 120 Airbus aircraft to be delivered: l Aircraft spares These are capitalised in the balance sheet at their list price and are then depreciated according to easyJets stated accounting policies for spares.
The corresponding credits are then spread equally across the cost of each of the 120 Airbus aircraft to be delivered.
Advance payments and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire aircraft are recorded at cost and separately disclosed.
On acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that date.
Interest incurred on borrowings that specifically fund progress payments on assets under construction is capitalised, either as part of the asset or if that asset is subsequently sold and leased back, deferred and amortised over the term of the lease.
Annual report and accounts 2004 59 Notes continued 1 Accounting policies continued Disposal of fixed assets Profits and losses on the disposal of fixed assets are generally charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
However, where the Group sells its rights to acquire an aircraft from either Airbus or Boeing to an external lessor and then leases the aircraft back then, subject to complying with the conditions of SSAP 21, the excess or deficit of net sale price over fair value on disposal is spread over the assets lease term.
The disposal of the purchase rights being the amount of pre-delivery deposits paid are recognised as a disposal from tangible fixed assets.
Pensions The Group contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Group contributions are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account in the year in which they are incurred.
Employee share schemes The cost of performance related awards to employees that take the form of rights to acquire or receive shares is recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
The cost represents the difference between the option exercise price if any and the market value of the shares at the date of gift or grant.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised over the period from gift or grant to when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
Where contingently issuable shares are gifted the cost of the share gift is recognised upon the crystallisation of the contingency.
Where performance criteria exist, the full potential cost is recognised over the period from gift or grant to when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
If it becomes reasonably certain that certain performance criteria will not be met, the costs already accrued in respect of these are then credited to the profit and loss account.
These costs are included in administrative expenses.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currencies The Group holds its aircraft through overseas subsidiaries.
The functional currency of these subsidiaries is considered to be US dollars because they are funded substantially with US dollar loans and the aircraft are anticipated to be sold for dollars within approximately seven years of their acquisition.
Profits and losses of these and other overseas subsidiaries are translated into pounds sterling at average rates of exchange during the year, with the adjustments to closing rates at the year end being taken to consolidated reserves.
The net assets of the overseas subsidiaries, including the advance payments made to secure the delivery of aircraft, are translated at closing rates, with gains and losses on re-translation also being taken to consolidated reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings that hedge foreign currency net assets are also taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings have been used to finance foreign equity investments or where those borrowings provide a hedge against the exchange risk associated with the existing foreign equity investments, the foreign equity investments are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange difference on the foreign equity investments is taken to consolidated reserves and, to the extent thereof, the resulting exchange difference on the foreign borrowings is offset against these exchange differences.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other than as referred to above, are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
60 Annual report and accounts 2004 1 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognised in the profit and loss account when realised as an offset to the related income or expense, as the Group does not enter into any such transactions for speculative purposes.
Costs of procuring financial instruments are held in debtors and matched against the period to which they relate.
Leases All of the Groups lease contracts are of an operating lease nature and are accounted for as operating leases, where the rental charges are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Aircraft maintenance Provision is made for the estimated future costs of major overhauls of leased airframes, engines and auxiliary power units by making appropriate charges to the profit and loss account calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year as a consequence of aircraft rectification obligations placed on the Group by the operating lease agreements.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purposes of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand, where formal offset arrangements are in place.
Liquid resources comprise deposits which have restrictions governing their use.
2 Segmental information All revenues derive from the Groups principal activity as an airline and include scheduled services, in-flight and related sales.
Substantially all of the Groups external revenues are earned by companies incorporated in the United Kingdom.
The geographical analysis of turnover is as follows: 2004 2003 million million Within the United Kingdom 224.1 206.3 Between the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe 728.5 646.1 Within the rest of Europe 138.4 79.4 1,091.0 931.8 All revenue from easyJets joint ventures share: 1.4 million in 2004 was derived within the United Kingdom.
All the Groups operating profit arises from airline-related activities.
The only revenue earning assets of the Group are its aircraft fleet.
Since the Groups aircraft fleet is employed flexibly across its route network, there is no suitable basis of allocating such assets and related liabilities to geographical segments.

The actual current tax charge for the current and the previous year differs from the standard rate for the reasons set out in the following reconciliation: 2004 2003 million million Profit on ordinary activities before tax 62.2 51.5 Tax charge at 30% 2003: 30% 18.6 15.4 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 1.8 Income not taxable 1.7 Lower tax rates in certain overseas jurisdictions 2.3 3.5 Movement in share option scheme deduction 2.0 2.1 Purchased goodwill not deductible 5.1 5.3 Fixed asset timing differences 10.1 6.4 Capital gains in excess of profit realised 3.8 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 4.7 2.8 Total current taxation 10.4 12.2 Deferred tax 10.7 6.9 Total taxation 21.1 19.1 Tax losses There are no UK tax losses available for use in future periods.
The amount of foreign tax losses available for use was less than 0.1 million in both the current and previous financial years.
Share options The introduction of new UK legislation governing corporate tax deductions for share options schemes means that for accounting periods commencing after 31 December 2002 a deduction is no longer available, on an accruals basis, for the difference between the market value of the shares and the share option price.
Instead this difference will be deductible when the share options are exercised.
The accounting period to 30 September 2004 is the first period to fall under the new rules.
64 Annual report and accounts 2004 7 Taxation continued These changes will lead to a deferred tax timing difference in respect of the accrual for the share option costs and hence the effective tax rate will not be affected by the new legislation.
As before, a tax deduction is available for Swiss employees upon exercise.
The closing share price at 30 September 2004 was 1.27 2003: 2.1975. easyJet Switzerland, a Group member, has the benefit of an exemption from communal and cantonal taxes in Switzerland until 1 January 2008, subject to meeting certain conditions.
The effective tax rate in Switzerland at present is 7.6%, but will rise to 27.5% from 1 January 2008 assuming that tax rates remain unchanged.
8 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year retained for equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for changes to the capital structure of the Group.
The calculation for diluted earnings per share uses the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted by the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group including other share schemes, which the Group considers to have been earned.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding during the year, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period when they were in existence as options.
The earnings per share are based on the following: Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2004 2003 Profit for the year retained for equity shareholders million 41.1 32.4 Number Number Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year used to calculate basic earnings per share millions 397.7 393.2 Weighted average number of dilutive share options used to calculate dilutive earnings per share millions 8.7 10.1 The derivation of profit for the calculation of adjusted EPS before goodwill amortisation is as follows.
This measure has been chosen to show the performance excluding goodwill amortisation, which is a significant non-cash balance in the profit and loss account: Year ended Year ended 30 September 30 September 2004 2003 million million Profit for the year retained for equity shareholders 41.1 32.4 Add back: goodwill amortisation 17.1 17.6 58.2 50.0 The derivation of profit for the calculation of adjusted EPS before goodwill amortisation, accelerated depreciation of certain owned aircraft, committed contribution to Deutsche BA, amounts written off investments and costs of integrating the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly is as follows.
This measure has been chosen because it removes the effects of non-recurring items, significant non-cash items and items which have had a disproportional effect on the earnings of the business during the year: Annual report and accounts 2004 65 Notes continued 8 Earnings per share continued Pre-tax Post-tax amount Tax effect amount Year ended 30 September 2004: million million million Profit for the year retained for equity shareholders 62.2 21.1 41.1 Add back: Goodwill amortisation 17.1 17.1 Accelerated depreciation of certain owned aircraft 6.1 1.8 4.3 85.4 22.9 62.5 Pre-tax Post-tax amount Tax effect amount Year ended 30 September 2003: million million million Profit for the year retained for equity shareholders 51.5 19.1 32.4 Add back: Goodwill amortisation 17.6 17.6 Committed contribution to Deutsche BA 1.3 1.3 Amounts written off investments 7.8 0.9 6.9 Costs of integrating the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly 7.9 2.4 5.5 Accelerated depreciation of certain owned aircraft 10.2 3.1 7.1 96.3 25.5 70.8 9 Intangible fixed assets Goodwill million Cost At 1 October 2003 350.9 Additions adjustments to purchase consideration see below 3.1 At 30 September 2004 347.8 Amortisation At 1 October 2003 21.1 Charge for the year 17.1 At 30 September 2004 38.2 Net book value At 30 September 2004 309.6 At 30 September 2003 329.8 Goodwill, which arose on the initial investment in easyJet Switzerland SA and the subsequent acquisition of that undertaking, is amortised to the consolidated profit and loss account over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
On 31 July 2002, the Group acquired Newgo1 Limited, the ultimate holding company of Go Fly Limited, an operator of low cost airline services.
Adjustment has been made to the goodwill arising on the basis that additional cashflows occurred during the year relating to the acquisition of Go Fly which had not been provided for at 30 September 2002.
In particular, during the year, a further 3.1 million of retention monies were received, reducing the cost of the investment.
The fair value of the net assets acquired has not changed.
Goodwill on this acquisition is amortised to the consolidated profit and loss account over its estimated useful life of 20 years.

The aircraft were retired in 2004, earlier than originally planned.
Given the distressed nature of the second-hand aircraft market at the time, the residual values were reassessed.
As a result, management provided 10.2 million additional depreciation in the financial year 2003 and 3.4 million additional depreciation in the financial year 2004 prior to their disposal.
easyJet performed a similar residual value review of its aircraft during the year ended 30 September 2004 and concluded that the six remaining owned Boeing 737-300 aircraft required an acceleration in depreciation.
This has led to an additional charge of 2.7 million in the current financial year.

Following the success of the bid in March 2001, easyJet invested 7.2 million including 0.3 million legal and consultancy fees as its investment to provide the Airline Group with the initial capital base needed for the purchase.
This investment was written off during the year ended 30 September 2002.
The amount written off includes loan notes of 6.6 million.
The accrued interest on the loan notes including that which has been internally capitalised within the Airline Group is 2.2 million 2003: 1.5 million.
This accrued interest has not been recognised since its recovery is uncertain.
Deutsche BA In the financial year 2003, easyJet wrote off its investment in Deutsche BA after deciding not to exercise its option to purchase.
The total amount written off, of 7.8 million, included 3.1 million for the cost of the option, plus 4.7 million of related professional costs.
No costs were incurred in financial year 2004.
The Big Orange Handling Company Limited In January 2004, easyJet Airline Company Limited, a Group company, entered into arrangement with Menzies Aviation Group Limited to carry out ground handling at London Luton Airport on a joint venture basis.
As part of the transaction, easyJet transferred the assets and liabilities of its existing ground handling business at London Luton Airport to The Big Orange Handling Company Limited Big Orange at their net book value.
The Big Orange Handling Company is incorporated in England and Wales.
easyJet owns 26% of the equity of Big Orange, and Menzies Aviation Group Limited owns the remainder.

These are as a result of legal and constructive obligations in the lease contract in respect of the return conditions applied by lessors, which require aircraft airframes, engines, landing gear and auxiliary power units to reach at least a specified condition on their return at the end of the lease term.
In most instances, to reach the specified conditions, easyJet will need to carry out a heavy duty maintenance check on each of the engines and the airframe once during the lease term, usually towards the end of the lease.
Other work may be required on landing gear and auxiliary power units.
The cost of heavy duty maintenance checks for airframe and engines are substantial airframe checks may cost between $1.0 million and $2.2 million, and shop visit checks may cost between $1.0 million and $2.4 million.
In accordance with FRS12, as there is a legal and constructive obligation to return the aircraft in a specified condition, a charge is made in the profit and loss account each month based on the number of flights hours or cycles used to allow the creation of a provision which is designed to cover the cost of heavy duty maintenance checks when they occur.
The cost of each heavy duty maintenance check is subject to uncertainty.
Management is required to make numerous estimates in calculating the provision required.
These include the expected date of the check since costs generally rise over time, market conditions for heavy duty maintenance checks pertaining at the expected date of check, the condition of asset at the time of the check this is particularly true of engines, whose true condition can only be established once it is off wing, the likely utilisation of the asset in terms of either flying hours or cycles, and the regulations in relation to extensions to lives of life limited parts, which form a significant proportion of the cost of heavy duty maintenance costs of engines.
In arriving at these estimates, management uses its historic experience, its assessment of future operational performance and market conditions, and also examines advice from industry specialists.
The Group is also required to pay maintenance reserves to certain lessors on a monthly basis, based on usage, to provide a security deposit for the lessor should the aircraft be returned without meeting its return conditions.
These maintenance reserves are then returned to the Group on production of evidence that qualifying maintenance expenditure has been incurred.
Maintenance reserves paid are deducted from the provision made.
In some instances, not all of the maintenance reserves paid can be recovered by the Group and therefore are retained by the lessor at the end of the lease term.
If management considers this is likely to occur, then an additional provision is made again either on a flying hours or cycles basis to cover the expected liability.
Assumptions made in respect of the basis of the provisions are reviewed for all aircraft once a year.
In addition, when further information becomes available which could materially change an estimate made, such as a heavy duty maintenance check taking place, utilisation assumptions changing, or return conditions being renegotiated, then specific estimates are reviewed immediately, and the provision is reset accordingly.

Substantially all of the employees accepted employer's Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the first tranche of options.
It is a condition of those options granted since March 2000 that the option holders accept liability for the employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the options.
For UK employees, once vested, the options remain in place should the employee leave the Group and may be exercised within a period ending ten years from the date of grant.
For Swiss employees, once vested, the options remain in place should the employee leave the Group and may be exercised within a period ending seven years from the date of grant.
Annual report and accounts 2004 73 Notes continued 19 Share options and other share awards continued An easyJet Supplemental Flotation Share Option Scheme was established in respect of both UK and Swiss employees to grant options to a number of participants who had inadvertently been issued with incorrect paperwork or who had been omitted from the original grants.
These supplemental options replaced original options, which had lapsed, but which had been included in the aggregate totals disclosed in the Listing Particulars for the Company when it listed.
These shares are included in the table of share options and grants outstanding above.
ii the easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme This award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2000 to eligible employees of FLS easyTech Limited easyTech, a 25% associate of easyJet Airline Company Limited with a three year vesting period and no performance criteria.
This grant was a catch-up, as it had not been possible to grant options to these employees under the easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme.
Further awards were made in December 2001, March 2003 and January 2004 to all eligible easyJet employees.
The options granted are subject to a three year vesting period and will be exercisable subject to performance criteria.
iii the easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme This award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2001 to eligible employees of the Group on terms that meet Inland Revenue requirements for an approved share option scheme.
Further awards were made in March 2003 and January 2004. iv The Management Combination Incentive Plan Since July 2002, a total of 3,148,572 shares have been granted under the terms of the plan, which rewarded key participants in the process of combining the businesses of easyJet and Go Fly with free shares when the three performance milestones of single brand, single AOC and combination completion were met.
All milestones have been met.
94,561 shares have lapsed since the inception of the scheme.
Employee Trusts have been set up to manage the share option schemes.
easyJet Trustees Limited, a company incorporated in Jersey manages two trusts, one for the benefit of UK employees and one for the benefit of Swiss employees.
When an employee exercises a share option under either the easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Plan, the easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme or the easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme, new shares are issued for the benefit of the trust.
Once the employee has made suitable arrangements for the funding of the option price and related tax liabilities which may include sale of some of the shares, then the shares are transferred to the benefit of the employee, at which point they are then able to sell the shares if they wish.
The period from the date of exercise to the date that the employee can first sell shares for their own benefit is usually four days.
During this period, all share price movement risk is with the employee.
Where shares are sold to meet tax liabilities, all transaction costs are met by the employee.
For the Management Combination Incentive Plan, easyJet purchased shares on the open market, so does not need to issue shares on exercise of the options.
Otherwise, the process of allocation of shares operates in a similar fashion.
Alternative accounting treatment Financial Reporting Standard FRS 20 Share-Based payment is changing the accounting for share options.
This includes expensing the fair value of the share options.
Application of this standard is mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and is effective for share options issued after 7 November 2002.
Had this accounting treatment been mandatory for the year ended 30 September 2004, the profit and loss account would have been subject to an additional charge of 2.3 million 2003: 0.7 million.
74 Annual report and accounts 2004 20 Contingent liabilities The Group is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business.
Whilst the result of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material affect on the Groups financial position or results.
In 2002, Navitaire Inc. Navitaire, a former supplier of airline reservation software to easyJet Airline Company Limited, a Group company, issued proceedings against that Group company alleging copyright infringement in relation to airline reservations software.
easyJet Airline Company Limited vigorously defended the claims.
In July 2004, judgment was given on the proceedings in the UK, which found that in all material respects, easyJet had not infringed any copyrights.
However, Navitaire may take leave to appeal, or refer the case to the European Court of Justice.
Proceedings have also been brought in the United States.
The directors consider that, in the event of Navitaire being successful in any claim, any award of damages is unlikely to be material to the Group.
21 Commitments a Lease commitments Commitments under operating leases to pay rentals during the year following the year end analysed according to the period in which each lease expires were as follows: Land and buildings 2004 2003 million million Expiring less than one year 0.2 0.1 Expiring between two and five years 0.3 0.2 Expiring after more than five years 0.1 0.1 0.6 0.4 Aircraft 2004 2003 million million Expiring less than one year 6.2 4.5 Expiring between two and five years 50.7 50.6 Expiring after more than five years 43.2 27.3 100.1 82.4 b Other financial commitments As a result of a purchase agreement approved by shareholders in March 2003, the Group is contractually committed to the acquisition of a further 99 new Airbus A319 aircraft with a list price of approximately US$4.4 billion, being approximately 2.4 billion before escalations, discounts and deposit payments already made.
In respect of those aircraft, deposit payments amounting to US$299.4 million 165.4 million had been made as at 30 September 2004, for commitments for the acquisition of Airbus A319 aircraft.
At 30 September 2004 the Group had placed a series of orders to purchase aircraft spare parts, totalling approximately 1.1 million 2003: 8.1million.
The Group is also contractually committed to the purchase of other assets totalling approximately nil million 2003: 0.4 million.

The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
The significant financial risks faced by the Group and the policies that it applies are considered below.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Over the past year the Group has used a limited range of derivative financial instruments and forward contracts to hedge its exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
The Group has not used any financial instruments to hedge its exposure to other foreign currencies and interest rate fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposures to these risks.
The primary hedging approach implemented has been to limit exposure to significant adverse movements in US dollar exchange rates and Jet A1 fuel costs using a range of option products.
In addition, forward contracts for US dollar requirements were used in the first half of the reporting period.
The level of hedging cover taken has been up to 85% of projected cash flows for US dollar and up to 80% for Jet A1 fuel on a one year horizon.
At 30 September 2004, the hedging in place included a range of options on US dollar pound sterling and Jet A1 fuel.
There were no outstanding forward contracts at that date.
For the purposes of this note, other than currency disclosures, the only debtors and creditors included are bank and shareholder loans, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments.
76 Annual report and accounts 2004 23 Financial instruments continued Foreign currency risk The Group has an international business.
Its reporting and principal trading currency is pounds sterling.
Aircraft purchases, sales and leasing transactions together with other aircraft related costs are denominated in US dollars.
The Group also operates, to a lesser extent, in a number of other currencies.
The Groups trade activity is concentrated in Europe, where there is a matching, to some extent, of the cash inflows and outflows of different European currencies.
The majority of the Groups trading revenue is derived in pounds sterling, although a significant amount of revenue is also derived in other European currencies and, other than fuel, insurance, aircraft leases, interest expense on external borrowings and some maintenance costs, the Groups cost base has a similar profile.
Fuel, insurance, aircraft leases, interest expense on external borrowings and some maintenance costs are payable in US dollars and movements in the value of the US dollar against pounds sterling impact these costs to the Group: a strong pound sterling against the US dollar reduces these costs to the Group.
30% of the total Group costs in the year ended 30 September 2004 were incurred by easyJet in the US dollar 2003: 27%.
There were minimal US dollar revenues.
Approximately 30% 2003: 32% of the Groups total assets that is, its owned aircraft and deposits paid towards the future acquisition of aircraft are denominated in US dollars, with the effect that the Groups balance sheet and, in particular, shareholders funds, can be significantly affected by movements in the rate of pounds sterling against the US dollar.
The Group mitigates the effect of such movements by borrowing in the same currencies as those US dollar denominated assets.
Owned aircraft are anticipated to be sold for US dollars within approximately seven years of their acquisition.
The resulting sale proceeds are expected to be used largely to pay down US dollar loans and as a result these large US dollar inflows are not considered to create a significant currency exposure to the Group.
The US dollar pounds sterling exchange rates at the respective year end were as follows: Year end exchange rate $ : 30 September 2004 1.81 30 September 2003 1.66 3% of the total Group costs in the year ended 30 September 2004 were incurred by easyJet Switzerland 2003: 3%, whose functional currency is the Swiss Franc.
The costs of that business are translated into pounds sterling at average exchange rates for the purposes of inclusion into the consolidated profit and loss account, and the net assets at the year-end exchange rate of the Swiss Franc against pounds sterling.
To a large extent, the exposure to the Swiss Franc is mitigated as revenue in that currency is also earned by the Group.
The table below summarises the Groups exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation to which they relate.

This target is to be achieved as leases on the new Airbus planes are implemented and the 23 fixed rate leases acquired with Go Fly expire.
The fixed and floating rate interest profile for leases at 30 September 2004 was 47% 53% for the Airbus aircraft and 58% 42% for the entire fleet 2003: 69% 31% entire fleet.
There is no such formal policy on bank loans, which are all at floating rates.

The loans are repayable in quarterly and six monthly instalments.
The majority of the Groups financial assets comprise bank balances, which attract interest at the applicable money market deposit rates.
At 30 September 2004, all of the Groups cash and liquid resources had a maturity of seven days or less and attracted a weighted average rate of 3.6% 2003: 3.2%.
The Group also pays operating lease rentals for the lease of aircraft.

Credit risk Potential concentrations comprise principally cash and trade debtors.
The majority of the Groups trade debtors are represented by amounts due from a few well-established credit card acquirers.
The cash balances are held with several major banks and rated money market funds.
The credit ratings for the credit card acquirers, banks and money market funds do not suggest there to be significant exposure as a result of these concentrations.
Funding risk The most significant investment activity undertaken by the Group historically has been the acquisition of aircraft.
To a large extent, the Group sells and leases back the aircraft to manage its funding risks.
The Group also owns planes which have been financed by asset-backed bank loans.
In March 2003, the Group agreed to purchase 120 new Airbus A319 planes for delivery over the next five years.
At 30 September 2004, the Group had taken delivery of 21 Airbus aircraft and has plans to take delivery of a further 34 in the coming year.
As a result of the order and expected deliveries, the Group continues to make significant deposits on aircraft.
At the same time it is recovering deposits paid previously as aircraft are taken delivery of.
As the Group has large cash resources to meet these payments and financing is arranged for the planes prior to delivery, no significant funding risk is perceived.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities A comparison by category of book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is provided in the table below.
30 September 2004 30 September 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value million million million million Primary financial instruments held to finance the Groups operations: Fuel hedges 13.7 1.5 1.1 Currency hedges 1.0 0.7 0.2 Bank loans 119.8 119.8 72.8 72.8 Cash 510.3 510.3 335.4 335.4 390.5 403.2 264.8 263.9 As described above, in the current year the Group used options to hedge its future exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged positions mature.
The variable rate interest terms on the bank loans are agreed on an arms-length basis and, therefore, the fair value of those loans approximate to their book values.
The fair value of the bank loans that are subject to fixed rate interest terms is not considered to be materially different from their book value on the basis that the period over which the interest terms are fixed is relatively short and that the fixed interest terms are agreed on an armslength basis.
Annual report and accounts 2004 79 Notes continued 23 Financial instruments continued The fair value of cash approximates to its book value due to its immediate availability.
For cash that is subject to restrictions, the cash attracts variable rate interest and therefore the fair value approximates to its book value.
In respect of the US dollar exchange rate, at 30 September 2004 the Group had $400 million of currency hedges through options, all of which expire before 30 September 2005.
At 30 September 2004, the total value of these instruments was 1.0 million representing a loss of 1.0 million.
2003:There was a loss of 0.5 million on hedging instruments.
In respect of fuel, the Group had hedges for 210,000 tonnes of fuel through options at 30 September 2004.
These all expire before 31 May 2005.
At 30 September 2004, the total value of these instruments was 13.7 million, representing a gain of 13.7 million.
2003:There was a loss of 0.4 million on hedging instruments.
There were no further hedges outstanding at 30 September 2004 2003: none.
