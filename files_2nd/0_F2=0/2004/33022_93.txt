08 Development Ensuring that our growing range of candidate drugs are developed effectively to meet the future needs of patients is a high priority.
John Patterson, Executive Director, Development People in our Development organisation focus on developing better drugs faster.
They work globally in therapy area-led product teams that bring together all the relevant functional skills and experience needed for the robust, rapid progress of new medicines and the management of development risks.
We aim to continuously improve the efficiency of our R&D by simplifying our processes, speeding up decision making and investing in areas directly linked to increasing the quality and number of new products.
A new clinical organisational structure was announced in October 2004 to support these practices and further enhance productivity.
In January 2005, we appointed an Executive Director for Development a new Board position as part of our accelerated significant programme of change to review our pipeline and optimise the contribution of our development and regulatory functions.
In 2004, 18 candidate drugs were selected 15 in 2003 and 11 in 2002.
By the end of the year, there were 31 projects in the preclinical phase and 17 projects in clinical phase 1, 17 projects in clinical phase 2 and 25 projects in clinical phase 3.
During the year we also concentrated on progressing regulatory filings for Exanta and supporting continued launches of new products.
We also continue to look at all the ways our existing products can be used or improved to get the most benefit for patients and in 2004 made regulatory submissions for new uses for Nexium, Symbicort and Atacand.
With effect from 1 January 2005 thinking ahead
