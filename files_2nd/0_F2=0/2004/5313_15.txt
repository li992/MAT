ElectroAR 41-56 rev tp 4 6 04 8:49 am Page 43 Electrocomponents plc 43 6Pension schemes The funding of the United Kingdom defined benefit Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The pension costs for the year ended 31 March 2004 amounted to 5.7m 2003: 3.9m reflecting an additional cost of 1.8m following a decision not to reflect the March 2001 surplus in the pension charge during the year.
In addition, the contributions paid by the Company to the defined contribution section of the Scheme in the year ended 31 March 2004 amounted to 0.2m.
The most recent valuation carried out in 2001 adopted a market related approach to funding using the projected unit credit method.
The assumptions underlying the calculation of the liabilities were derived by reference to the gross redemption yield on long term gilts in conjunction with a pre-retirement equity enhancement, consistent with market conditions at the time of the valuation.
The principal assumptions applied in the 2001 valuation were therefore as follows: PAST FUTURE SERVICE SERVICE Investment return: before retirement 6.25% 6.50% after retirement 5.00% 5.25% Rate of future earnings inflation 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase in pensions payment 2.50% 2.50% At the date of the 2001 valuation, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 169.8m, and the actuarial valuation of the assets covered 115% of the benefits that had accrued to the members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings giving a surplus of 22.1m.
Theexcess assets above the value of the liabilities were being eliminated by means of a reduction in the level of employer contributions to the Scheme.
The next valuation will be carried out as at 31 March 2004.
Less formal funding updates are carried out each year and as at 31 March 2003 a deficit of 64.1m was identified.
It is expected however, that the forthcoming formal valuation will show that the position will have improved since that review.
Under the statutory minimum funding requirement, the position of the Scheme remains good with the funding level being estimated at between 125% and 130% as at 31 March 2004.
In addition to the UK scheme outlined above there are certain pension benefits provided on a defined contribution basis in Australia and NorthAmerica amounting to 0.7m 2003: 0.7m, on a defined benefit basis in Germany and Ireland amounting to 0.4m 2003: 0.4m, and via government schemes in France, Italy, Denmark and North Asia amounting to 1.8m 2003: 1.6m.

b Borrowing facilities As at 31 March 2004 the Group had a 135.1m committed borrowing facility 2003: 158.2m denominated in US Dollars, of which 56.4m was undrawn 2003: 118.9m.
The undrawn amount will all expire in between one and two years.
c Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities It is considered that the fair value of all the Groups financial assets and liabilities approximates to their carrying value because of the short term nature of these amounts.
d Group hedging The Group hedges a very high percentage of the foreign currency exposure arising from its trading activities over the course of the next 12 months, through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Company provides foreign currency inter-company loans to a number of its subsidiaries.
The foreign currency asset in the parent company is hedged in full using currency swaps.
This has the effect on a Group basis of converting an inter-company loan into a partial hedge against net foreign currency assets in the relevant currency.
The following table shows the nominal Sterling amount of the forward foreign exchange contracts in place at 31 March 2004 valued at the forward contracted rates and at the year end rates.
The difference between the two is the unrecognised gain or loss.
The hedges have no book value.
