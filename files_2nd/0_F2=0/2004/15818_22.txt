Goodwill arising on acquisitions made on or before May 2, 1998 was charged directly to reserves and is recaptured through the profit and loss on disposal.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Under US GAAP, effective May 1, 2002 Tomkins adopted SFAS 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
In accordance with this statement, goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized but are subject to an impairment test annually and whenever a triggering event occurs.
b Inventories Under UK GAAP, inventory is stated at the lower of cost, determined on a first-in first-out FIFO basis, and net realizable value.
The last-in first-out LIFO method is prohibited.
Under US GAAP, inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value.
Tomkins adopts the LIFO method for determining the cost of inventory for a number of its US subsidiaries.
c Discontinued operations Under UK GAAP discontinued operations are defined as those where the sale or termination is completed either in the period or before the earlier of three months after the year end or the date of approval of the financial statements.
The disposal must have a material effect on the nature of operations resulting from its withdrawal from a particular market or from a material reduction in turnover from continuing markets.
Sales and operating profit are disclosed separately on the face of the profit and loss account.
Assets and liabilities are not separately distinguished.
Under US GAAP, the results of a component of an entity that has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale are separately reported in a single caption.
Accordingly, revenues and expenses reported under US GAAP will be different from those reported under UK GAAP.
Furthermore, the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are presented separately in the balance sheet.
d Classification differences In addition to the recognition and measurement differences between UK and US GAAP there are a number of differences in the manner in which amounts are presented and classified in the accounts.
The principal presentation and classification differences are summarized below: UK GAAP requires assets to be presented in ascending order of liquidity in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, whereas under US GAAP assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.
In addition, current assets under UK GAAP include amounts that fall due after more than one year, whereas under US GAAP, such assets are classified as non-current assets.
Under UK GAAP assets and liabilities relating to different plans are not offset in presentation.
Under US GAAP, assets and liabilities of different plans are offset in presentation.
UK GAAP requires profits and losses in relation to the disposal of fixed assets to be shown separately on the face of the profit and loss account below operating profit.
In addition, items that result from the ongoing activities of the business but are significant because of their size or nature may be separately highlighted on the face of the profit and loss account.
Under US GAAP, the items described above are included in operating income.
Items that form part of operating activities and are significant in size or nature may be separately highlighted on the face of the profit and loss account or in the accompanying notes.
Under UK GAAP, equity in net income loss of associates before taxes is reported as part of operating profit, whereas under US GAAP it is reported after operating profit.
Directors Report and Accounts 2004 77 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 5.
SEGMENT INFORMATION CONTINUED e Pensions Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24 Accounting for Pension Costs, with costs being charged to income over employees estimated working lives.
Under US GAAP, pension costs are determined in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No.
87 Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No.
88 Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.
Key differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise from the requirement to use different methods and assumptions for valuing scheme assets and scheme liabilities, as well as a different method of amortizing surpluses or deficits.
Under UK GAAP, the effect of the variations in cost can be accumulated at successive valuations and amortized on an aggregate basis.
Under US GAAP, the amortization of the transition asset and the costs of past service benefit improvements are separately tracked.
Experience gains losses are dealt with on an aggregate basis but amortized only to the extent that they exceed 10 per cent of the greater of the plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the fiscal year.
UK GAAP allows measurements of plan assets and liabilities to be based on the results of the latest actuarial valuation, whereas US GAAP requires measurement of plan assets and liabilities to be made at the date of the financial statements or up to three months prior to that date.
US GAAP also requires that a minimum pension liability be recorded for the amount by which the plan is under-funded ignoring projected future salary increases.
A corresponding amount is recorded as an intangible asset, to the extent of unrecognized prior service cost, and the balance is recorded in other comprehensive income, net of tax.
f Share options Under UK GAAP, the difference between the exercise price and the market price of the shares at the grant date is recorded as compensation expense in the income statement.
As described within Note 2 to these financial statements, under US GAAP, stock based compensation is accounted for in accordance with APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
Under APB 25, the Company recognizes compensation expense for the difference between the exercise price and market price at the measurement date over the vesting period.
The measurement date is the first date on which the employer knows the number of shares that an employee is entitled to receive and the exercise price is known.
Where the measurement date occurs after the grant date, as in the case of performance related options, compensation cost is recorded over the vesting period for the difference between the share price at the balance sheet date and the exercise price and is adjusted in subsequent periods up to the measurement date.
Where the performance condition is such that management cannot make a reasonable estimate because the company cannot control the outcome of the performance conditions, such as the achievement of a target share price, no compensation cost is recognized until the performance condition is satisfied.
Under UK GAAP, the compensation costs relating to share options granted to employees under annual bonus plans that vest in future periods are recognized on the grant date.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost relating to such grants are recognized over the future vesting period.
g Capitalization of interest Under UK GAAP, interest expense is not capitalized whereas under US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest expense incurred while constructing major projects is included in fixed assets and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
h Restructuring costs Under UK GAAP, restructuring costs are recognized when there is an unavoidable obligation as a result of a past event and a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
Under US GAAP, restructuring costs and one-time termination benefits are recognized as incurred.
i Exceptional items UK GAAP requires profits and losses in relation to the disposal of fixed assets to be shown separately on the face of the profit and loss account below operating profit.
j Derivative instruments Tomkins has entered into derivative financial instrument contracts in order to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
Under UK GAAP, where there are derivative instruments that qualify as a hedge, gains and losses are deferred and recognized in the income statement, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, only when the hedged transaction has itself settled and been reflected in the Companys accounts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognized at that time.
Derivatives entered into to hedge the net investment in overseas entities are recorded directly to shareholders equity.
The Company has determined that under US GAAP their derivative instruments are not regarded as hedges and any unrealized gains or losses arising at the period end are taken to income.
Derivatives entered into to hedge the net investment in overseas entities do not qualify as a hedge under US GAAP and any gains or losses are charged to the income statement.
k Dividend creditor and investments Under UK GAAP, accruals for dividends on preferred stock and investments are excluded from net operating assets.
These are included for the US GAAP measure.

This gives rise to deferred tax assets of $552.1 million.
$531.1 million of this amount can be carried forward indefinitely.
The remaining $21.0 million has expiration dates between 2006 and 2019.
A valuation allowance of $530.4 million has been established against those assets where, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized.

INCOME TAXES CONTINUED A reconciliation of income taxes at the UK statutory tax rates to the provision benefit for income taxes in the consolidated statement of operations follows: Eight months Year ended Year ended Year ended ended January 1, January 3, December 31, April 30, 2005 2004 2002 2002 $ million $ million $ million $ million 149.3 63.0 105.8 Tax at United Kingdom statutory rate 30% 127.8 Tax effect of: Non-deductible goodwill impairment amortization 4.3 14.7 15.8 Other permanent differences 18.5 32.5 1.5 28.9 Effect of overseas tax rates 0.8 11.4 9.8 6.7 Release of contingency 27.4 147.9 Deferred tax valuation adjustment 1.0 8.6 14.8 14.0 Foreign tax credits 7.5 8.0 8.0 103.2 32.2 135.8 Income tax expense benefit 72.2 Undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries approximate to $2.8 billion at January 1, 2005.
No income taxes have been provided on the Companys share of these undistributed net earnings due to managements intent to reinvest such amounts indefinitely.
A determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability has not been made because it is not practicable to do so.
On October 22, 2004 the United States enacted the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 the Act.
The Act creates a temporary incentive by providing an 85 per cent dividends received deduction for certain dividends received by US companies from their overseas subsidiaries.
The deduction is subject to a number of limitations and, as of today, uncertainty remains as to how to interpret numerous provisions in the Act.
As of January 1, 2005 management had not decided on whether, and to what extent, the Company might repatriate foreign earnings to our US companies.
Accordingly, the financial statements do not reflect any taxes with regard to the repatriation provision under the Act.
The Company expects that a determination can be made with regard to the repatriation provision within a reasonable period of time following the publication of additional clarifying language.
INCOME PER COMMON SHARE Basic income per common share was calculated using income for the period divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted income per common share considers the effect of potential common shares, unless the inclusion of the potential common shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.

Stock options numbering 8,226,950, fiscal 2003 12,941,950, fiscal 2002 10,409,020, fiscal 2001 2 9,846,970 with an exercise price higher than the average market price during the fiscal year or period since issuance, were excluded in computing diluted earnings per share since the impact would be antidilutive.
For the purposes of diluted earnings per share the income is increased for the preference dividend of $28.5 million fiscal 2003 $47.1 million: fiscal 2002 $37.6 million.

The fair value of goodwill is calculated using discounted cash flows derived from financial plans prepared annually by subsidiaries.
Impairments have arisen as a result of an expectation of a deterioration in certain markets in which our subsidiaries operate.
Amortization expense was $52.3 million for fiscal 2001 02.
The Company will continue to perform its annual tests for impairment as required under the rules of SFAS 142 as of December 31.

STOCK BASED COMPENSATION The Company operates a number of stock based compensation schemes.
These are as follows: i The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
2 ESOS 2, The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
3 ESOS 3 and The Tomkins Executive Share Option Scheme No.
4 ESOS 4 ESOS 2 has expired for grant purposes, though options already granted remain outstanding and can be exercised in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
ESOS 3 is an Inland Revenue-approved scheme under which Tomkins employees who are resident in the United Kingdom for tax purposes are able to receive options with an aggregate exercise price not exceeding 30,000 that attract favorable tax treatment.
ESOS 4 is not approved by the Inland Revenue and is a scheme under which options granted do not attract favorable tax treatment in the United Kingdom.
There is a limit to the number of options that can be granted under the ESOS 4 scheme of four times annual remuneration which includes annual bonuses and certain benefits-in-kind.
Under ESOS 4, options granted in excess of four times a participants annual earnings super options will only be exercisable if at least five years have elapsed since the date of grant and then only if, over a five-year period following the grant of the option, the growth in the Companys earnings per share is such that it would be in the top quartile of a league table for growth in earnings per share over a five-year period for companies in the FTSE 100 index.
ESOS 3 and ESOS 4 will continue and their current performance condition will remain in place until they lapse for grant purposes in 2005.
The performance condition is based upon the growth in Tomkins earnings per share, which must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by an average of 2 per cent per annum over a three-year period before an option can be exercised.
When the schemes were introduced in 1995, the earnings per share performance condition was widely adopted and the choice of 2 per cent was in accordance with contemporary practice.
In determining whether or not the growth in earnings per share performance condition has been met, a simple arithmetic calculation is made annually when the Companys results are known.
ii Tomkins Premium Priced Option This was an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol as part of the incentive package on his joining Tomkins.
No performance conditions were attached to this option in order to attract him to the Company and retain his services and this therefore does not comply with Schedule A of the Combined Code.
It consists of a non-transferable option to acquire 5,076,142 shares with an aggregate market value of 10 million, granted on 11 February 2002.
The price per share payable on the exercise of the option will be 197 pence in respect of 2,538,072 shares A option shares, 276 pence in respect of 1,522,842 shares B option shares and 345 pence in respect of 1,015,228 shares C option shares.
The options vested as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2003, as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2004 and as to one-third of A, B and C option shares on 18 February 2005.
The option will lapse on 11 February 2012 or earlier in certain circumstances.
iii Ongoing Option This was also an option specifically and solely granted to James Nicol on 11 February 2002, as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
It consisted of a non-transferable option to acquire 1,522,842 shares at 197 pence, which could not be exercised before 18 February 2005 and unless and until the performance condition has been satisfied or waived.
The performance condition will be achieved if, on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant, the rate of increase of earnings per share over any three-year period is equal to or greater than the rate of increase of the Retail Price Index plus 9 per cent.
The performance condition may be waived or amended by the Remuneration Committee.
If there is a change of control of the Company then the option is exercisable immediately regardless of whether the performance condition is satisfied.
The same lapsing events for the Premium Priced Option apply to this option.
iv The Tomkins Savings Related Share Option Scheme No.
2 This is a standard Inland Revenue-approved savings related share option scheme, which is open to employees who are resident for tax purposes in the United Kingdom.
v Deferred Matching Share Purchase Plan This was specifically and solely introduced for James Nicol as part of the incentive package to attract him to the Company.
Under this Plan 3,045,684 shares Matching Shares were awarded on February 11, 2002 following the purchase by James Nicol of 1,015,228 Tomkins plc shares the Purchased Shares.
On February 18, 2005, the award vested in respect of 1,015,228 Matching Shares and of the remaining 2,030,456 Matching Shares, 454,752 vested and the balance lapsed.
The number of shares which vested was calculated on the basis of the highest price of a Tomkins share sustained over a five-day period during the six-month period ended February 18, 2005 285.25 pence, to the extent that, for every 1 penny that the share price increased over 197 pence, being the market price on February 18, 2002, up to a maximum of 591 pence, James Nicol was entitled to receive 5,153 shares.
Under the terms of his contract, Mr Nicol elected to receive a cash payment of 4,193,000 subject to statutory deductions in lieu of shares.
vi Annual Bonus Incentive Plan The executive Directors and senior executives participate in the Companys Annual Bonus Incentive Plan.
Bonus shares are restricted and vest only after a period of three years after the initial bonus award.
Deferred shares are awarded at the time of the initial bonus award but the vesting of the shares is conditional on continued employment with the Group three years after the award.
Dividends are not paid on the deferred shares.
Under FAS 123, the fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black Scholes option-pricing model with the following weightedaverage assumptions: January 1, 2005 January 3, 2004 December 31, 2002 April 30, 2002 Risk free interest rate 4.51% 4.43% 5.02% 4.85% Expected life years 5.8 6 6 6 Assumed volatility 31.50% 31.50% 31.50% 31.50% Expected dividends 12p 12p 12p 12p Directors Report and Accounts 2004 83 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13.

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS CONTINUED Pension plan assets Plan assets are invested in equity securities, bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments, and insurance contracts.
The Companys weighted-average worldwide actual asset allocations at January 1, 2005 and January 3, 2004 by asset category are as follows: Plan assets January 1, 2005 January 3, 2004 Target allocation Asset category Equity securities 61% 65% 65-75% Fixed income securities 35% 30% 27-33% Other 4% 5% 0-10% Total 100% 100% 100% The Companys investment strategy for pension plan assets includes diversification to minimize interest and market risks, and generally does not involve the use of derivative financial instruments.
Plan assets are rebalanced periodically to maintain target asset allocations.
Maturities of investments are not necessarily related to the timing of expected future benefit payments, but adequate liquidity to make immediate and medium term benefit payments is ensured.
Contributions The Companys funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations.
Post retirement health and life insurance benefits are funded as incurred.
The Company expects to contribute approximately $74.3 million to its pension plans during fiscal 2005.
Health care cost trends and the impact of the Medicare Prescription Act of 2004 The weighted average annual rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered benefits i. e. health care cost trend rate is assumed to be 9.74% for 2005, reducing gradually to 4.5% by 2011 and remaining at that level thereafter.
A one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have the following effects as of January 1, 2005: 1 % Point increase 1 % Point decrease $ million $ million Effect on the total of service and interest cost 1.2 1.2 Effect on the post retirement benefit obligation 19.0 18.3 In December 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act was signed into law.
The Act introduced a plan sponsor subsidy based on a percentage of a beneficiarys annual prescription drug benefits, within defined limits, and the opportunity for a retiree to obtain prescription drug benefits under Medicare.
In January 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, or FSP FAS 106-1.
FSP FAS 106-1 allows for current recognition or a one-time deferral of the effects of the Act.
The deferral suspends the application of SFAS No.
106s, Employers Accounting for Post retirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, measurement requirements, and it revised SFAS 132s disclosure requirements for pensions and other post retirement plans for the effects of the Act.
In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position FAS 106-2, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act, or FSP FAS 106-2, which supercedes FSP FAS 106-1 and provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Act and requires employers that sponsor post retirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug benefits to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy included in the Act.
FSP FAS 106-2 was effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after June 15, 2004 and the Company has elected to take the one-time deferral, the impact of which has not had a material impact on the Companys results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES a Obligations under operating and capital leases Future minimum lease payments under operating and capital leases that have initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year at January 1, 2005 are as follows: Operating Capital $ million $ million Fiscal year ending: 2005 31.3 7.6 2006 25.3 3.8 2007 22.7 3.3 2008 19.0 3.3 2009 16.1 2.5 Thereafter 74.7 9.4 Total minimum payments 189.1 29.9 Less interest on capital leases 6.7 189.1 23.2 Total principal payable on capital leases The rent expense for land and buildings under operating leases was $26.5 million in fiscal 2004: $20.4 million in fiscal 2003: $11.8 million in fiscal 2002 and $16.3 million in fiscal 2001 02.
The rent expense for plant and machinery under operating leases was $12.8 million in fiscal 2004: $15.2 million in fiscal 2003: $5.8 million in fiscal 2002 and $14.0 million in fiscal 2001 02. b Litigation The Company is, from time to time, party to legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The Directors do not anticipate that the outcome of any of the above proceedings and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company enters into derivative transactions pursuant to its risk management policies to manage market risks such as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
The Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
The estimated fair values of the Companys financial instruments are summarized below: January 1, 2005 January 3, 2004 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value $ million $ million $ million $ million Assets liabilities Long-term debt, including current portion 788.3 847.4 740.9 778.2 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 46.5 46.5 54.1 54.1 Cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash 365.4 365.4 321.1 321.1 Other financial assets 52.4 52.4 52.3 54.6 Other financial liabilities 3.0 3.0 Derivative instruments Currency forwards hedging net investments 13.1 13.1 2.5 2.5 Interest rate swaps 7.7 19.2 7.3 6.3 Other currency forwards and swaps 0.2 3.1 0.2 0.2 Deposits are short-term bank deposits and investments in short-term money market securities.
Therefore fair values closely approximate to book values.
Borrowings mainly consist of the 150 million 8 per cent sterling bond, and the 250 million 6.125 per cent bond, the fair values of which have been determined by reference to their respective market prices at January 1, 2005.
The remaining borrowings are at floating interest rates and fair values have been determined by reference to market rates.
The preference shares are not traded on an organized market, and as such, fair values are not readily available.
Derivative instruments, principally interest rate swaps and spot and forward foreign exchange contracts are used to assist in the management of currency and interest rate risks.
Transaction exposure contracts are for a period equal to the exposure and as such are not speculative.
Foreign currency derivatives are used to ensure that the Companys net borrowings are retained in proportion to the currencies in which the Companys assets are denominated.
This aims to match the shareholders required currency exposure to the actual exposure.
All foreign exchange contracts will mature in the next year.
Interest rate swaps are used to manage interest rate risk and to achieve the desired combination of fixed and floating rate debt.
Swaps are used to convert the fixed rate on both the 2011 and 2015 bonds 8 per cent and 6.125 per cent respectively to floating rate at 6 month LIBOR 255 basis points and 3 month LIBOR 108 basis points respectively.
The duration of the swaps matches the duration of the underlying debt.
Directors Report and Accounts 2004 89 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 16.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED Interest rate swaps are also held to restrict the amount of floating rate debt held in US dollars, and the corresponding exposure to movements in the US dollar interest rate.
$210 million of debt is swapped from floating to fixed rate, over a combination of 1.5 and 3.5 year maturities.
The fair-values of these contracts represent the estimated amount that would be paid or received if the contract was terminated.
The Company is not party to any leveraged contracts.
Risk of counterparty default is limited by the use of policy limits.
Counterparties are assigned a ranking according to credit rating and other financial information.
