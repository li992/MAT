Pension commitments The Group operates two pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
Westbury Pension Scheme A formal valuation of the pension scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2003 by Watson Wyatt LLP.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The rate of investment return on existing assets of the Scheme and on future contributions was assumed to be 7.1% per annum.
Additionally, it was assumed that salaries would increase at a rate of 4.0% per annum, pensions earned before 5 April 1997 would increase at a rate of 3% per annum and those earned after that date would increase at a rate of 2.5% per annum.
The market value of the Schemes investments at the effective date of the valuation was 28,401,000 and the results indicated that these assets represented 64% of the benefits which had accrued to members after allowing for future increases in earnings.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account has been calculated by Watson Wyatt LLP.
It is based on the actuarial valuation as at 5 April 2003 and, with the exception of future investment returns on both the existing assets of the Scheme and future contributions which have been assumed to be 7.6% per annum, all assumptions are the same as those used for the actuarial valuation.
The resulting pension cost comprises a regular cost of 7.9% of Pensionable Earnings to meet the normal accrual of benefits, plus an annual amount of 1,824,000 indexed with national average earnings in future years to meet the deficiency over the average remaining service lives of the contributing members, less the interest on the pre-payment.
The contributions are determined by qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
Until October 2003, the Group contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 14% of Pensionable Earnings plus an additional amount to meet the minimum requirement under the Schedule of Contributions for the year to April 2003.
Commencing from October 2003 the Group contributed to the Scheme at a rate of 9.4% of Pensionable Earnings plus additional monthly contributions equivalent to 1,830,000 per annum, in line with the revised Schedule of Contributions.
These rates of contribution have decreased the prepayment to 3,827,000 at 29 February 2004 2003: 3,870,000.
During the year to 29 February 2004, the Group met administrative costs of 268,862 2003: 227,595 on behalf of the pension arrangements.
At 29 February 2004 there were no outstanding unpaid contributions in respect of the year to that date 2003: nil.
Prowting Pension Scheme The most recent actuarial valuation of the Scheme for the purpose of calculating the Employers pension costs was carried out as at 31 March 2003 by Mercer Human Resource Consulting Ltd, and the Attained Age method was used.
The Schemes assets were valued at market value.
The main assumptions used to determine the pension costs are rates of investment returns of 6.5% per annum pre-retirement and 5.5% per annum post-retirement for all members.
Further assumptions were Pensionable Salary increases of 4.0% per annum and pension increases of 3.0% per annum on pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions.

Pension commitments continued At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 13,453,000 million, and this represented 81% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The funding position was reassessed in August 2003 where the funding position had improved with 88% of the value of the benefits covered by assets.
The Employer contributed 10.9% of pensionable salaries into the Scheme until 1 December 2003.
From 1 December 2003 onwards the Employer contributes 17.7% of pensionable salaries plus a monthly amount of 14,840 following the results of the actuarial valuation and the advice of the Scheme Actuary.
The pension cost for the Employer for the financial year ended 29 February 2004 was 453,000 2003: 343,000.
Group Personal Pension Plan In addition, the Group provides a money purchase Group Personal Pension Plan.
The contributions to this arrangement plus payments in respect of death-in-service insurance premiums were 77,589 2003: 58,521.
FRS 17 disclosures The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been calculated by independent actuaries based on the more recent full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2003 updated on 29 February 2004.
This applies to both the Westbury Pension Scheme and the Prowting Pension Scheme.
