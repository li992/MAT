56 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 Valuation of property assets Investment properties have been valued by the Directors at 31st December 2004 on an open market basis.
The next independent valuation is due in the year ending 31st December 2005.
Tenanted land and buildings were valued as at 31st December 2003 by Messrs Bidwells, Property Consultants as external valuers in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Standards of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors.
In reaching the final figure Bidwells departed from the Standards to the extent that they were instructed to inspect and revalue only those properties where the carrying value was in excess of 0.15m and properties where new agreements had been entered into since 31st December 2000.
Bidwells assumed that each port will continue to be operational and have made the special assumption that all the properties are free from any contamination and that any spillages or contamination will be removed by the tenant prior to the termination of the lease.
The properties were valued on the basis of Market Value with the exception of one building at Rosyth, which was valued at a Depreciated Replacement Cost due to its specialist nature.
In accordance with the Valuation Standards, Messrs Bidwells confirmed that they have carried out the valuation of the assets since 1991 and have not provided other property advice.
In relation to that firms preceding year the total fees paid by the Forth Ports PLC group as a percentage of the firms total fee income was less than 5%.
It is not anticipated that there will be a material increase.
The valuer, John Sommerville BSc.
Hons, MRICS, signed the valuation for the first time.
The valuations were incorporated into the accounts at 31st December 2003 with the resulting revaluation surplus of 12.6m being taken to the Revaluation Reserve.
No deferred tax is provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets, unless, by the Balance Sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.
The Directors confirm that the valuation of tenanted land and buildings has not materially changed since the date of the last formal valuation.
If tenanted land and buildings and investment properties had not been revalued, they would have been included at the following amounts at 31st December 2004: Group Group Company Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Cost 15.1 16.4 11.9 11.9 Aggregate depreciation based on cost 11.3 11.0 10.3 10.2 Net book value based on cost 3.8 5.4 1.6 1.7 The Group balances for 2003 have been amended to include figures for tenanted land and buildings in a subsidiary company omitted in the prior year.
Capital commitments Capital commitments, including the value of work still to be carried out on contracts placed but not provided for, were 7.7m for the Group and 2.0m for the Company 2003 Group 5.3m and Company 3.0m.

Interest Rate Risk Profile of Financial Liabilities The Groups policy on interest rates is to keep floating rate borrowings under review and to use financial instruments to lock into specific rates as and when appropriate.
There is no specific level of Group borrowings that must be fixed.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31st December 2004 was as follows: Floating Rate Fixed Rate Financial Financial Total Currency Liabilities Liabilities Borrowings UK Sterling m m m At 31st December 2004 168.6 0.5 169.1 At 31st December 2003 111.2 0.5 111.7 All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above table either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.
The fixed rate 3.75% financial liabilities are redeemable at the discretion of the Board of Forth Ports PLC.
Accordingly, no weighted average period to maturity is shown see Note 18.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates based on LIBOR which are fixed in advance for periods of up to six months.

Financial instruments continued Financial Assets The Group aims to maintain a level of liquidity appropriate to its short-term needs and longer-term strategy.
Enough working capital should be available to allow the Group to operate efficiently without there being surplus funds drawn from the lenders.
At no time should the Group exceed its overdraft and borrowing limits.
Other than short-term debtors the Group has financial assets as follows: 2004 2003 mm Assets held as part of financing arrangements for the Group Sterling cash deposits 7.3 5.3 Debt instruments Zero coupon loan stock held in joint venture company in sterling denominated securities 27.5 25.5 34.8 30.8 The sterling cash deposits comprise deposits placed on money markets at call and monthly rates.
The zero coupon loan stock has a repayment date of 2013.
Currency Exposures The Groups objectives in managing currency exposures are to use options or other instruments to hedge against future movements where there is material risk from currency exposure.
The Group conducts a relatively small amount of business in currencies other than sterling, and exposure to foreign currency risks is limited.
The Groups currency exposures, that is, those transactional or non-structural exposures gave rise to less than 10,000 of net currency gains and losses recognised in the Profit and Loss Account in 2004 and 2003.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than the Groups local currency.
It relates to the fair value of the deferred consideration for the purchase of the balance of the Groups share of the cost of the joint venture investment in Multi-Link Terminals Limited.

Pension schemes The Group operates two pension schemes that cover the vast majority of employees.
Other employees are covered by a national scheme.
The schemes that the Group has established are as follows: Forth Ports PLC Pension Scheme Port of Tilbury London Limited Pension Fund These schemes are of the defined benefit type, providing benefits that are linked to pay near retirement.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds that are administered by trustees.
These funds are held separately from the Company assets.
The pension cost relating to these schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The latest actuarial assessments of the schemes were as at 5th April 2002.
Assets are taken at their market value.
Liabilities are valued using various assumptions.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The assumptions used for the valuations were linked to market conditions.
It was assumed that the investment return will exceed price inflation by 3.5% per annum and that salary increases will exceed price inflation by 1.5% per annum.
The projected unit method was used to determine the pension cost.
Taking the schemes together, the assets represented 94% of the total liabilities: the market value of the assets was 101m.
The funding level of the Forth Ports Scheme exceeded 100%.
The funding level of the Tilbury Fund was 71%.
The total pension cost for these schemes was 4.1m 2003 4.1m.
This compares with Group contributions of 8.9m 2003 8.8m : member contributions are paid in addition.
Additional contributions are being paid to the Tilbury Fund in order to improve the funding level of that Fund.
Subject to actuarial advice these contributions will be met by increases in the monthly payments for the next several years.
The need for these additional contributions is partly due to the imposition of a Minimum Funding Requirement MFR for UK pension schemes.
The MFR position for the Forth Ports Scheme is satisfactory and no special contributions are required.
In addition to the schemes that have been set up specifically for Group employees, a number of employees are members of the Former Registered Dock Workers Pension Scheme: this is a national scheme providing defined benefits based on pay near retirement.
However, the contributions paid by the Group are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme as the Group is unable to identify its share of the assets and liabilities in the scheme.
The Group contributions during the year were 0.2m 2003 0.2m.
The pension cost figures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP24.
Under transitional arrangements the Group is required to disclose the following information about the schemes and the figures that would have been shown under FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
Full actuarial valuations of the Groups two schemes were carried out at 5th April 2002.
The results have been updated to 31st December 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: At 31st At 31st At 31st December 2004 December 2003 December 2002 %%% Rate of increase in salaries 3.85 3.85 3.75 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.00 3.00 3.00 Discount rate 5.40 5.50 5.50 Inflation assumption 2.60 2.60 2.25 ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 69 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 30.
