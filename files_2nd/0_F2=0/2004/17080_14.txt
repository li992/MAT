Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 01 | Segmental analysis The Groups reporting segments have changed.
The changes were first reported in the 2004 Interim Statement.
These more appropriately align external reporting with the customer focused product categories sold in the markets in which the Group operates.
The segment previously named Filtration and Separation has been divided into LabSciences and MedTech: the segment previously named Biotechnology has been renamed BioScience.
The 2003 comparatives have been restated.
LabSciences is the preparation of non-cellular samples prior to analysis, including environmental applications.
Products include cellulose and glass filtration media, membranes and chromatography: in addition to traditional products, this segment includes syringe filters, capsules and other encapsulated products, as well as microbiological products.
MedTech comprises components supplied on an OEM basis to manufacturers of medical devices and clinical diagnostic tests.
BioScience is the preparation of cellular samples prior to analysis and storage for study of nucleic acids or proteins.
It comprises FTA, multiwell plates, column based DNA separation and electrophoresis products, protein micro-arrays, blotting and neo-natal paper.

The home country of the Company is the UK.
The areas of operation are principally the manufacture and sale of products for applications in LabSciences, BioScience and MedTech.
As production activities of the Group are integrated, many of the assets are common to more than one business segment.
Consequently, an analysis by business segment would not provide meaningful information and therefore has not been given.

Under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, the Group has also made certain disclosures in relation to defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes The Group operates defined contribution or money purchase schemes in the UK, US and Germany.
The benefits are determined directly by the value of contributions paid in respect of each member and the investment performance achieved on those contributions.
In the UK and Germany, all UK and German-based employees of the Group, respectively, are entitled to join the schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
In the US contributions are made annually to the 401 k scheme.
As at 31 December 2004, contributions of 349,000 2003: 413,000 were outstanding representing the unpaid contributions for the year.
The table below shows the regular cost to the Group of providing these pensions to employees.
The regular cost represents contributions payable to the scheme by the Group.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
As payments to the 401 k in the US are made annually by the Group, the regular cost below has still to be paid into the scheme.
2004 2003 Defined contribution schemes 000 000 UK 59 36 US 349 413 Germany 32 - Other 43 - Total defined contribution schemes 483 449 Defined benefit schemes The Group operates a number of defined benefit or final salary schemes.
These are located mainly in the UK and Germany.
UK defined benefit scheme The scheme in the UK is funded and is now closed to new employees.
The benefits are determined with reference to the length of service and final salary upon which employees take retirement.
Under SSAP 24, contributions are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company.
Contributions are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of a triennial valuation.
The last valuation was done on 6 April 2003.
Using the attained age method, this disclosed assets with a market value of 42,565,000, equivalent to 111% of the accrued liabilities, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The main actuarial assumptions used were: Valuation assumptions % Rate Pre-retirement investment return 6.5% Post-retirement investment return current pensioners 4.5% Post-retirement investment return employees yet to retire 5.5% Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% Rate of increase of pension payments 2.5% As at 6 April 2003 the MFR funding calculation showed a funding level of 146%.
The effective rate of the employers contributions decreased from 16.2% to 10% from 1 January 2004 in accordance with recommendations submitted by the Scheme Actuary.
Contributions from employees for the year were 6.0% from 1 January to 30 June increasing to 6.75% from 1 July 2004.
The total contributions to the scheme over the year amounted to 481,000 2003: 988,000.
The total charge in respect of the UK based defined benefit scheme is 256,000 2003: 780,000.
The reason for the decrease was the reduction in UK based employees.
Whatman Annual Report 2004 | 41 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 08 | Pensions continued German defined benefit schemes The schemes in Germany were operated by Schleicher & Schuell, a company acquired by the Group on 30 November 2004 see note 27.
Two different types of defined benefit pension are provided in Germany.
These are the fixed amount plan and the final salary plan.
Both of these are closed to new entrants.
The fixed amount plan provides retirement and disability pensions and a dependents pension.
The plan guarantees a fixed pension up to a maximum of approximately 18,400 per annum.
This is subject to an inflationary increase of 2% per annum up to the age of retirement and 3.5% thereafter.
The normal retirement age is 65.
The final salary plans provide retirement, disability and dependents pensions.
Pensions are determined with respect to salary and years in service to the Group.
Both these schemes are operated as fully provided but unfunded schemes.
The Group pays into an insurance policy to cover the full pension liability in the event of insolvency.
The gross liability of the defined benefit scheme was determined by a qualified independent actuary.
The most recent valuation was as at 30 November 2004.
The valuation of the deficit under SSAP 24 was carried out using the same valuation assumptions as those used to calculate the deficit under FRS 17.
This valued the deficit at 8,229,000 at 30 November 2004 and as at 31 December 2004.
The regular cost of the pension under SSAP 24 was 44,000 for the month of December.
A summary of the total group pension costs is given in the table below.

The Group has adopted the transitional disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
It differs from SSAP 24 principally with regard to the choice of assumptions and in that differences between the market value of the assets and liabilities of the scheme are recognised immediately in the balance sheet whereas they are recognised on a smoothed basis through the profit and loss account under SSAP 24.
The Group is not required to account for retirement benefits under FRS 17 as full implementation has been deferred, but is required to present certain transitional disclosures which are set out below.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 6 April 2003 and updated to 31 December 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
As the scheme in the UK is now closed to new employees, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will rise as a percentage of salary as the scheme members approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuary in nominal terms are set out in the following table.

This amount would become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
Provision has not been made for tax of 710,000 in respect of prior year capital gains as the gains have been rolled into replacement assets.
This tax could become payable if the relevant replacement assets were sold.
At present it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future in respect of these gains.
A deferred tax asset of 5,000,000 in respect of trading losses has not been recognised.
Recovery of this amount is dependent on the profitability of the relevant operations in the future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, and hence no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

The age discrimination and supply agreement cases were settled in 2003 for amounts lower than those provided for and the excess provisions written back.
Following the decision to place Biometra into voluntary liquidation the provision for patent infringement was released in 2003 and the balance combined with the newly created provision for the cost of closing Biometra.
In addition, a provision against the net assets of Biometra has been made.
The restructuring provision for Whatman includes costs for the following: Site rationalisation programme to reduce the number of manufacturing sites as announced in 2001 Reducing worldwide headcount to around 800, as announced on 30 December 2002 The increase in the provision of 701,000 relates mainly to redundancy costs for the CEO and other senior management.
The Schleicher & Schuell restructuring provision relates to the facilities rationalisation programmes following the acquisition of Schleicher & Schuell resulting in a net headcount reduction of around 160 as announced on 31 December 2004.
The pension provision relates to the unfunded defined benefit liabilities acquired with Schleicher and Schuell.
This is described in note 8.
The onerous lease provision relates to the costs of vacant possession of properties from which the business has been relocated.
During the year, additional amounts have been provided for the cost of the Parkwood and Larkfield onerous leases.

The increase relates to the loan facility of 95,000,000 for the acquisition of Schleicher & Schuell and the working capital requirement of the enlarged group.
The Group also has contingent liabilities in respect of leases sub-let and assigned in the ordinary course of business.
23 | Derivatives and other financial instruments In reporting derivatives and other financial instruments, the Group has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 13 not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short-term debtors and creditors, other than in relation to currency exposure disclosures.
Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and equity capital.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide financing for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, that arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its financing.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no dealing in financial instruments shall be undertaken, except for the purpose of hedging the Groups financial risks.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The Board considers each of these risks on a regular basis and the Groups policy towards each of these risks has remained unchanged during the year.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity capital, retained profits, cash, bank overdrafts and bank borrowings.
The Group finances its acquisitions primarily through bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in the desired currencies mainly at floating rates of interest and uses interest rate swaps, as deemed appropriate, to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts and bank borrowings.
The Group predominantly uses a medium term credit facility incorporating a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility from a London bank.
In addition, the Group maintains undrawn committed borrowing facilities, after taking into account anticipated expenditure on acquisitions, of at least 10% of borrowing facilities, in order to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity.
Short term flexibility is achieved by the use of bank overdrafts.
Foreign currency risk The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations, primarily in the US and Continental Europe.
As a result, the Groups sterling balance sheet can be significantly affected by movements in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates.
The Group seeks to reduce the effect of these currency exposures by matching its currency borrowings with the overseas foreign currency assets to the extent that total borrowings do not significantly exceed funding requirements.
Approximately 60% of the Groups investments in non-sterling operations are hedged in this way.
The Group also has a transactional exposure with significant sales and a smaller element of purchases being made in a currency other than the functional currency of the operating units.
In addition, the Group has an exposure in translating the profits of overseas operations into sterling.
The Groups policy is to actively manage the currency risk by covering 100% of the anticipated exposures in major foreign currencies for a period of between one and two years using forward foreign exchange contracts.

The floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowing bearing interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging from one to three months by reference to the relevant foreign currency LIBOR and bank overdrafts.
In addition, the Groups provisions of 3,489,000 for onerous lease contracts note 21 meet the definition of financial liabilities.
Of these, 875,000 is expected to mature within one year, 793,000 between one and two years, 1,469,000 between two and five years and 352,000 in greater than five years.
The maturity profile of interest bearing financial liabilities is shown in note 19.

The fair values and goodwill arising are provisional and subject to finalisation as the acquisition was made within one month of the year end.
Schleicher and Schuell owns a 28% interest in BioDot Inc, a private company incorporated in California.
BioDot designs, manufactures, markets and sells micro-scale liquid dispensing systems and related peripheral equipment and services.
These are used to develop and produce diagnostic tests for markets.
The markets include medical, food, environmental, veterinary and agriculture.
BioDot Inc prepares financial statements to 31 October.
It is accounted for as an associate undertaking using the equity method of accounting.
Schleicher & Schuells share of net assets totalled 177,000 as at 30 November 2004 and is reflected within fixed asset investments in the table of acquired assets and liabilities.
The goodwill net of accumulated amortisation arising on the acquisition of 283,000 is within intangible fixed assets.
The investment in BioDot has been fair valued to nil as no dividend has been paid since Schleicher and Schuell acquired BioDot.
Furthermore, no dividends are expected for the foreseeable future and there is no ready market in which to sell the shares.
As the investment has been fair valued to nil, and has only been held for one month of the year, further Group associate disclosures have not been given on the ground of materiality.
Provisions for liabilities and charges includes amounts in respect of the pension liability and deferred tax liability.
There will be no material effect on deferred tax should the acquired assets be sold at their fair value.
