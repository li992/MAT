24 Pensions The Group operates a number of funded final salary pension schemes including two executive arrangements, all of which have been set up under Trusts that hold their financial assets separately from those of the Group.
In addition, a number of dened contribution arrangements are currently operated, however the cost of these is immaterial and is not separately disclosed within the pension costs for the Group.
Two of the schemes, namely the Mirror Group Pension Scheme the Old Scheme and the MGN Past Service Pension Scheme the Past Service Scheme cover the liabilities in respect of service up to 13 February 1992, the date when the Old Scheme was closed.
The Past Service Scheme was established to meet the liabilities for service up to 13 February 1992 for employees and former employees, who worked regularly on the production and distribution of Mirror Groups newspapers, which are not satisfied by payments from the Old Scheme and the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan or by the State.
An actuarial valuation of these pension schemes as at 31 December 2002, showed that they have insufficient assets to meet their liabilities for members benets, therefore contributions of 3.5 million were paid to the Past Service Scheme in 2004.
In 2005 agreement has been reached with the trustees to pay 9 million and for actuarial valuations to be carried out during the year.
In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a further eight final salary schemes.
Formal valuations of schemes are carried out regularly, the actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate each schemes assets and liabilities varying according to the actuarial and funding policies adopted by their respective trustees.
