NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 1.
"NATURE OF OPERATIONS The company, its subsidiaries and joint ventures the group"" carry out gold mining activities and exploration."
The group currently has one operating mine in Mali, West Africa, the Morila gold mine, which commenced production in October 2000, a mine in the construction phase, the Loulo mine, also in Mali, as well as a portfolio of exploration projects in West and East Africa.
"The interests of the group are Morila SA ""Morila"" which owns the Morila mine and Somilo SA ""Somilo"" which conducts the development activities at the Loulo mine site."
Randgold Resources holds an effective 40% interest in Morila, following the sale to AngloGold Ashanti Limited on July 3, 2000 of one-half of Randgold Resources' wholly-owned subsidiary, Morila Limited.
Management of Morila Limited, the 80% shareholder of Morila, is effected through a joint venture committee, with Randgold Resources and AngloGold Ashanti each appointing one-half of the members of the committee.
"AngloGold Services Mali SA ""Anser"", a subsidiary of AngloGold Ashanti, is the operator of Morila."
Randgold Resources holds an effective 80% interest in Loulo.
The remaining 20% interest is held by the Malian government.
Randgold Resources is the operator of Loulo.
In May 2004, construction started on the Loulo mine which is scheduled to come into production in July 2005, initially as an open pit operation.
A development study is in progress to assess the economics of mining the much larger underground resources at Loulo.
A US$60 million project finance agreement for Loulo was concluded in September 2004.
The loan, which is repayable between June 2006 and September 2009, was arranged by mandated lead-arrangers N M Rothschild & Sons Limited and SG Corporate & Investment Banking, who have been joined in the facility by Absa Bank and HVB Group as lead-arrangers.
Drawdown of the loan commenced in December 2004.
Until then, the group funded the capital project itself.
The main focus of exploration work is on the groups advanced projects in Mali West, around Morila and in Senegal and more recently Tanzania, Burkina Faso and Ghana.
The Tongon project in Cte dIvoire is at an earlier stage of feasibility, where the data currently available is less accurate but of a sufficient level of detail for preliminary economic analysis to be undertaken.
As a result of the political situation in Cte dIvoire, which started in September 2002, no further exploration activity has been possible on the project.
On April 5, 2004 Resolute Mining Limited exercised its option to buy the groups 80% interest in the Syama mine, which had been on care and maintenance since 2001.
At a gold price of more than US$350 per ounce, Randgold Resources will also receive a royalty of US$10 per ounce on the first million ounces of production from Syama and US$5 per ounce on the next three million ounces based on the attributable ounces acquired by Resolute.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, except for the accounting policy for development costs and mine plant facilities.
This accounting policy has been changed to clarify the treatment of costs relating to the definition of mineralisation in existing orebodies or the expansion of the productive capacity of existing operating mines.
BASIS OF PREPARATION: The consolidated financial statements of Randgold Resources and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by available-for-sale financial assets, and financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments which are carried at fair value.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying the companys accounting policies.
GENERAL: The financial statements are measured and presented in US dollars, as it is the primary measurement currency in which transactions are undertaken.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated to US dollars at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial period.
Translation gains and losses arising at period-end, as well as those arising on the translation of settled transactions occurring in currencies other than the functional currency, are included in net income.
CONSOLIDATION: The consolidated financial information includes the financial statements of the company, its subsidiaries and company's proportionate share of the joint venture.
SUBSIDIARIES: Subsidiaries are all entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies generally accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights.
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the group.
They are deconsolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group.
The cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable to the acquisition.
Identifiable assets acquired including mineral property interests and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any minority interest.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
PAGE SEVENTY JOINT VENTURES: Joint ventures are those entities in which the group holds a long-term interest and which is jointly controlled by the group and one or more venturers under a contractual arrangement.
The groups interest in jointly controlled entities is accounted for by proportionate consolidation.
Under this method the group includes its share of the joint ventures individual income and expenses, assets and liabilities and cash flows on a line by line basis with similar items in the groups financial statements.
The group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets by the group to the joint venture that is attributable to the other venturers.
The group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the purchase of assets by the group from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an independent party.
However, if a loss on the transaction provides evidence of a reduction in the net realisable value of current assets or an impairment loss, the loss is recognised immediately.
The results of joint ventures are included from the effective dates of acquisition and up to the effective dates of disposal.
Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
SEGMENT REPORTING: A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in performing mining or other services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: a Measurement and presentation currency Items included in the financial statements of each of the groups entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates.
The consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars, which is the companys measurement and presentation currency.
b Transactions and balances Foreign currency transactions are translated into the measurement currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss, are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss.
Translation differences on non-monetary items, such as equities classified as available-for-sale financial assets, are included in the fair value reserve in equity.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT: a Undeveloped properties Undeveloped properties upon which the group has not performed sufficient exploration work to determine whether significant mineralisation exists, are carried at original cost.
Where the directors consider that there is little likelihood of the properties being exploited, or the value of the exploitable rights have diminished below cost, an impairment is recorded.
b Development costs and mine plant facilities Development costs consist primarily of direct expenditure to develop an orebody for economic exploitation and to expand production capacity of existing operating mines.
Following the completion of a feasibility study, development costs used to place a new mine into production are capitalised.
Development costs and the costs of construction of mine plant facilities relating to major developments at existing mines are capitalised immediately.
Development costs continue to be capitalised until commercial levels of production are achieved, at which time the costs are amortised as noted in d below.
c Non-mining fixed assets Other non-mining fixed assets are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation.
d Depreciation and amortisation Long-lived assets include mining properties, mine development costs and mine plant facilities.
These assets have useful economic lives which exceed that of the life of the mine.
Depreciation and amortisation are therefore charged over the life of the mine based on estimated ore tonnes contained in proven and probable reserves.
Proven and probable ore reserves reflect estimated quantities of economically recoverable reserves, which can be recovered in the future from known mineral deposits.
Short-lived assets which include motor vehicles, office equipment and computer equipment, are depreciated over estimated useful lives of between two to five years.
e Mining property evaluations The carrying amount of the long-lived assets of the group are annually compared to the recoverable amount of the assets, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amount is the higher of value in use and net selling price.
In assessing the value in use, the expected future cash flows from the asset is determined by applying a discount rate to the anticipated pre-tax future cash flows.
The discount rate used is the groups weighted average cost of capital.
An impairment is recognised in the income statement to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets recoverable amount.
The revised carrying amounts are amortised in line with group accounting policies.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed if the recoverable amount increases as a result of a reversal of the conditions that originally resulted in the impairment.
This reversal is recognised in the income statement and is limited to the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised in prior years.
The estimates of future discounted cash flows are subject to risks and uncertainties including the future gold price.
PAGE SEVENTY-ONE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 CONTINUED It is therefore reasonably possible that changes could occur which may affect the recoverability of mining assets.
DEFERRED STRIPPING COSTS: The costs of waste stripping in excess of the expected pit life average stripping ratio are deferred, and charged to production when the actual ratio is below the expected average ratio.
The expected pit life average stripping ratio is calculated as the ratio of future anticipated waste tonnes to be mined, to anticipated future ore tonnes to be mined.
This ratio is recalculated annually in light of additional knowledge and changes in estimates.
The expected pit life ratio is then compared to waste associated with ore mined during the period so as to calculate the deferred stripping costs to be deferred or released for the year.
INVENTORIES: Which include ore stockpiles, gold in process and supplies and insurance spares, are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The cost of ore stockpiles and gold produced is determined principally by the weighted average cost method using related production costs.
Stockpiles consist of two types of ore, high-grade and medium-grade ore, which will be processed through the processing plant.
Both highand medium-grade stockpiles are currently being processed and all ore is expected to be fully processed within the life of mine.
The processing of ore in stockpiles occurs in accordance with the life of mine processing plan that has been optimised based on the known mineral reserves, current plant capacity and mine design.
Stores and materials consist of consumable stores and are valued at average cost after appropriate provision for redundant and slow moving items.
INTEREST: Is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the period to maturity.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are measured as set out below.
Financial instruments carried on the balance sheet include cash and cash equivalents, investments in subsidiaries and joint venture, receivables, accounts payable, borrowings and derivative financial instruments.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES AND JOINT VENTURE: Are stated at cost less any provisions for impairment in the financial statements of the company.
Dividends are accounted for when declared in respect of unlisted investments.
On the disposal of an investment, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount is charged or credited to the income statement.
DERIVATIVES: Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value, unless they meet the criteria for the normal purchases normal sales exemption.
On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the group designates the derivative for accounting purposes as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge.
Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the group's risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective, and that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge, are recognised directly in equity.
Amounts deferred in equity are included in the income statement in the same periods during which the hedge firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects net profit or loss.
Recognition of derivatives which meet the criteria for own use are deferred until settlement.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement.
The group formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
This process includes linking derivatives designed as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to specific firm commitments for forecasted transactions.
The group formally assesses, both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
RECEIVABLES: Are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS: Include all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase.
REHABILITATION COSTS: The net present value of estimated future rehabilitation cost estimates is recognised and provided for in the financial statements and capitalised to mining assets on initial recognition.
Initial recognition is at the time of the disturbance occurring and thereafter as and when additional environmental disturbances are created.
The estimates are reviewed annually to take into account the effects of inflation and changes in estimates and are discounted using rates that reflect the time value of money.
Annual increases in the provision are charged to income and consist of finance costs relating to the change in present value of the provision and inflationary increases in the provision estimate.
The present value of additional environmental disturbances created are capitalised to mining assets against an increase in the rehabilitation provision.
The rehabilitation asset is amortised as noted previously.
Rehabilitation projects undertaken, included in the estimates, are charged to the provision as incurred.
PAGE SEVENTY-TWO Environmental liabilities, other than rehabilitation costs, which relate to liabilities arising from specific events, are expensed when they are known, probable and may be reasonably estimated.
PROVISIONS: Are recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events where it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
BORROWINGS: Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
ACCOUNTS PAYABLE: Are stated at cost adjusted for payments made to reflect the value of the anticipated economic outflow of resources.
DEFERRED INCOME TAXES: Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
However, if the deferred income tax arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss, it is not accounted for.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
EMPLOYEE BENEFITS: a Pension obligations The group has defined contribution plans.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
For defined contribution plans, the group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered provident funds on a mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis.
The group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
The contributions are recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due.
Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
b Termination benefits Termination benefits are payable when employment is terminated before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.
The group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either: terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal: or providing termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Benefits falling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to present value.
c Profit-sharing and bonus plans The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses.
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
FINANCE LEASES: Leases of plant and equipment where the group assumes a significant portion of risks and rewards of ownership are classified as a finance lease.
Finance leases are capitalised at the estimated present value of the underlying lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and the finance charges to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The interest portion of the finance payment is charged to the income statement over the lease period.
The plant and equipment acquired under the finance lease are depreciated over the useful lives of the assets.
REVENUE RECOGNITION: Revenue is recognised as follows: a Gold sales Revenue arising from gold sales is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership and title pass to the buyer under the terms of the applicable contract and the pricing is fixed and determinable.
b Interest income Interest is recognised on a time proportion basis, taking into account the principal outstanding and the effective rate over the period to maturity.
EXPLORATION COSTS: Are expensed as incurred.
Costs related to property acquisitions are capitalised.
EARNINGS PER SHARE: Is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
FULLY DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE: Is presented when the inclusion of potential ordinary shares has a dilutive effect on earnings per share.
PAGE SEVENTYTHREE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 CONTINUED 3.
INCOME AND MINING TAXES The company is not subject to income tax in Jersey.
Morila SA, benefits from a five year tax holiday in Mali.
The tax holiday of Morila SA expires on 14 November 2005.
The benefit of the tax holiday to the group was to increase its net income by US$11.7 million and US$22.5 million, due to not recording its share of Morila's tax expense for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Accordingly, had the group not benefited from the tax holiday in Mali, earnings per share would have been reduced by US$0.20 and US$0.39 for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
Under Malian tax law, income tax is based on the greater of 35 per cent of taxable income or 0.75 per cent of gross revenue.
Somilo SA also benefits from a five year tax holiday in Mali commencing from the date of first commercial production.
Income Per share numerator Share amount US$000 denominator US$ 4.

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING POLICY The accounting policy for development costs and mine plant facilities has been changed to clarify the treatment of costs relating to the definition of mineralisation in existing orebodies or the expansion of the production capacity of existing operating mines.
Previously, these costs were expensed.
The effect of the change is the capitalisation in 2004 of US$3.9 million of drilling costs relating to the underground development study at Loulo.
This change has no impact on the prior financial years.
In the opinion of the directors, this treatment of the costs better reflects industry practice.
RESTRICTED CASH Debt service reserve - 3 882 - -- The debt service reserve account relates to the N M Rothschild & Sons Limited debt service reserve account.
This amount was held in escrow for partial repayment of the Morila project loan.
INVENTORIES AND ORE STOCKPILES Consumable stores 6 091 8 385 - - Short-term portion of ore stockpiles 803 2 373 - - Gold in process 2 868 525 - - 9 762 11 283 - - Long-term portion of ore stockpiles 12 054 5 882 - - 21 816 17 165 - - Included in ore stockpiles is an amount of US$nil 2003: US$1.7 million attributable for the high-grade tailings stock at Morila, which is stated at its net realisable value.
The attributable carrying value of this stock pile is US$0.5 million 2003: US$1.7 million but has been stated at zero value in 2004, due to uncertainty as to whether the material will be used in production.
Ore stockpiles have been split between long and short term based on current life of mine plan estimates.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Mine properties, mine development costs and mine plant facilities and equipment.
Cost At beginning of year 174 304 168 540 321 321 Disposal of Syama 24 92 994 - - - Additions 70 329 5 764 - - 151 639 174 304 321 321 Accumulated depreciation and amortisation At beginning of year 102 373 92 104 321 321 Disposal of Syama 24 89 326 - - - Charge for the year 8 738 10 269 - - 21 785 102 373 321 321 NET BOOK VALUE 129 854 71 931 - - LONG-LIFE ASSETS Included in property, plant and equipment are long-life assets which are amortised over the life of the mine and comprise the metallurgical plant, tailings and raw water dams, power plant and mine infrastructure.
The net book value of these assets was US$111.1 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: US$53.2 million.
PAGE SEVENTY-FIVE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 CONTINUED 9.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT CONTINUED SHORT-LIFE ASSETS Included in property, plant and equipment are short-life assets which are amortised over their useful lives and are comprised of motor vehicles and other equipment.
The net book value of these assets was US$9.1 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: US$9.0 million.
UNDEVELOPED PROPERTY Included in property, plant and equipment are undeveloped property costs of US$9.7 million 2003: US$9.7 million.
DEFERRED STRIPPING COSTS Opening balance 10 885 7 402 - - Additions during the period 3 999 3 483 - - Short-term portion 6 370 - - - Total 8 514 10 885 - - The deferred stripping balances at the end of 2004 and 2003 pertain to the Morila mine.
In terms of the life of mine plan, pre-stripping is performed in the earlier years.
This results in the cost associated with waste stripped at a rate higher than the expected pit life average stripping ratio, being deferred to those years.
These costs will be released in the period where the actual stripping ratio decreases to below such expected pit life ratio.
The expected pit life average stripping ratios used to calculate the deferred stripping were 4.36 in 2004 and 3.68 in 2003.
The change in the average stripping ratio was due to higher grades being accessed during the current financial year.
As a result of the change in life-of-mine estimated stripping ratio in December 2004 compared to December 2003, US$0.7 million less mining costs were deferred.
These stripping ratios were calculated taking into account the actual strip ratios achieved of 3.98 and 4.77 for 2004 and 2003 respectively.

The company received net proceeds of US$8.6 million which included the repayment of amounts previously advanced to Somisy.
PROVISION FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REHABILITATION Opening balance 5 962 4 972 - - Disposal of Syama 24 2 438 - - - Additions 177 990 - - 3 701 5 962 - - The provisions for close down and restoration costs include estimates for the effect of future inflation and have been discounted to their present value at 6% per annum, being an estimate of the cost of borrowing.
Syama was sold during the year to Resolute Mining who have assumed the rehabilitation liability of Syama.
Although limited environmental rehabilitation regulations currently exist in Mali to govern the mines, management has based the environmental rehabilitation accrual using the standards as set by the World Bank, which require an environmental management plan, an annual environmental report, a closure plan, an up-to-date register of plans of the facility, preservation of public safety on closure, carrying out rehabilitation works and ensuring sufficient funds exist for the closure works.
However, it is reasonably possible that the group's estimate of its ultimate rehabilitation liabilities could change as a result of changes in regulations or cost estimates.
The group is committed to rehabilitation of its properties.
To ensure that it is adequately provided to do so, it makes use of independent environmental consultants for advice and it also uses past experience in similar situations to ensure that the provisions for rehabilitation are adequate.
There are no unasserted claims reflected in the provision for Morila.
While the ultimate clean-up costs may be uncertain, there are no uncertainties with respect to joint and several liability that may affect the magnitude of the contingency at Morila as the extent of these obligations are clearly defined in their respective mining conventions.
The total undiscounted cost of rehabilitation is estimated at US$12.3 million of which the majority will only be spent after seven years.
There are no other potentially responsible parties to consider for cost sharing arrangements.
The company carries insurance against pollution including cost of cleanup.
At present, there are no losses and or claims outstanding.
As at the end of 2004, no rehabilitation liability was provided for by Somilo as the environmental disturbances were minimal, being earthworks and civils limited to a very small area.

ADDITIONAL CASH FLOW INFORMATION Income and mining taxes paid in the consolidated statements of cash flows reflects actual cash paid.
FAIR VALUE AND RISKS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The group's financial instruments are set out in note 21.
In the normal course of its operations, the group is exposed to commodity price, currency, interest, liquidity and credit risk.
In order to manage these risks, the group enters into derivative financial instruments.
All derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost and subsequently measured at their fair value on the balance sheet.
20.1 Concentration of credit risk The group's financial instruments do not represent a concentration of credit risk because the group sells its gold to and deals with a variety of major financial institutions.
Its receivables and loans are regularly monitored and assessed and an adequate level of provision for doubtful debt is maintained.
Gold bullion, the group's principal product, is produced in Mali.
The gold produced is sold to reputable gold refineries.
Because of the international market for gold the group believes that no concentration of credit risk exists with respect to the selected refineries to which the gold is sold.
Included in receivables is US$12.4 million 2003: US$5.9 million relating to indirect taxes owing to Morila by the State of Mali, which is denominated in FCFA.
PAGE EIGHTY-ONE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 CONTINUED 20.
FAIR VALUE AND RISKS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED 20.2 Foreign currency and commodity price risk In the normal course of business, the group enters into transactions denominated in foreign currencies primarily Euro and Communaute Financire Africaine Franc.
As a result, the group is subject to transaction exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
Generally the group does not hedge its exposure to gold price fluctuation risk and sells at market spot prices.
These prices are in US dollars and do not expose the group to any currency fluctuation risk.
However, during periods of capital expenditure or loan finance, the company secures a floor price through simple forward contracts and options whilst maintaining significant exposure to spot prices.
20.3 Interest rates and liquidity risk Fluctuation in interest rates impact on the value of short-term cash investments and financing activities including long-term loans, giving rise to interest rate risk.
In the ordinary course of business, the group receives cash from its operations and is required to fund working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
This cash is managed to ensure surplus funds are invested in a manner to achieve maximum returns while minimising risks.
The group has in the past been able to actively source financing through public offerings, shareholder loans and third party loans.
FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The following table presents the carrying amounts and fair values of the group's financial instruments outstanding at 31 December 2004 and 2003.
The fair value of a financial instrument is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.

The figures shown above are the financial instruments taken out as part of the Loulo project financing.
The Loulo price protection was initially done on a short dated spot deferred basis.
With the completion of the final mining schedules and feasibility study, as well as credit approval of the project financing, the hedged ounces were rolled out and matched to future production.
Prior to this, the Loulo instruments were deemed speculative for accounting purposes.
The Morila hedge book was fully utilised in 2004.

The carrying amounts are a reasonable estimate of the fair values because of the short maturity of such instruments.
Long-term debt The fair value of market-based floating rate long-term debt is estimated using the expected future payments discounted at market interest rates.
No fair value is determinable for the loans from minority shareholders as repayment is contingent on net available cash from the projects.
Gold price contracts The fair value of gold price forward and option contracts has been determined by reference to quoted market rates at year-end balance sheet dates.

In terms of the Operator Agreement between Morila SA and AngloGold Services Mali SA, a management fee, calculated as 1% of the total sales of Morila, is payable to AngloGold Services Mali SA quarterly in arrears.
The attributable management fees for the year ended December 31, 2004 amounted to US$0.8 million 2003:US$1.1 million.
Purchasing and consultancy services are also provided by AngloGold Ashanti to the mine on a reimbursable basis.

SALE OF SYAMA In April 2003, the company entered into an option agreement with the Australian company Resolute Mining Limited, over its interest in the Syama mine in Mali.
In terms of the agreement, Resolute was given a 12 month period in which to conduct a full due diligence over Syama.
On 5 April 2004, Resolute Mining exercised its option to buy the companys 80% interest in the Syama mine.
Resolute paid the group US$9.9 million and transaction fees of US$1.2 million were incurred.
Furthermore, at a gold price of more than US$350 per ounce, the company would receive a royalty of US$10 per ounce on the first million ounces of production from Syama and US$5 per ounce on the next three million ounces based on the attributable ounces acquired by Resolute.
This has not been included in the profit attributable to the sale of Syama, as it is linked to a gold price of US$350 and the Syama mine is still on care and maintenance.
The assets and liabilities of Syama disposed of were as follows: 31 Dec US$000 2004 Property, plant and equipment 3 668 Current assets 3 797 Total assets 7 465 Total liabilities 5 901 Net assets 1 564 Proceeds from sale 8 634 Profit on disposal of Syama 7 070 Proceeds from sale 8 634 Cash disposed 63 Net cash on sale 8 571 25.
PRO FORMA INFORMATION Total cash costs per ounce are calculated by dividing total cash costs, as determined using the Gold Institute industry Standard, by gold ounces produced for all periods presented.
The Gold Institute is a non-profit international association of miners, refiners, bullion suppliers and manufacturers of gold products, which has developed a uniform format for reporting production costs on a per ounce basis.
The standard was first adopted in 1996 and revised in November 1999.
Total cash costs, as defined in the Gold Institute Standard, include mine production, transport and refinery costs, general and administrative costs, movement in production inventories and ore stockpiles, transfers to and from deferred stripping and royalties.
The transfer to and from deferred stripping is calculated based on the actual historical waste stripping costs, as applied to a life of mine estimated stripping ratio.
The costs of waste stripping in excess of the life of mine estimated stripping ratio, are deferred and charged to production, at the average historical cost of mining the deferred waste, when the actual stripping ratio is below the life of mine stripping ratio.
The net effect is to include a proportional share of total estimated stripping costs for the life of the mine, based on the current period ore mined.
We have calculated total cash costs on a consistent basis for all periods presented.
Total cash costs per ounce should not be considered by investors as an alternative to operating profit or net profit attributable to shareholders, as an alternative to other IFRS measures or an indicator of our performance.
While the Gold Institute has provided a definition from the calculation of total cash costs per ounce, the calculation of total cash costs per ounce may vary from company to company and may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.
However, we believe that total cash costs per ounce is a useful indicator to investors and management of a mining companys performance as it provides an indication of a companys profitability and efficiency, the trends in costs as the companys operation mature, a measure of a companys gross margin per ounce, by comparison of total cash costs per ounce to the spot price of gold, and a benchmark of performance to allow for comparison against other companies.
