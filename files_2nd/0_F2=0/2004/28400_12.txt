 LLP Chartered Accountants and Registered Auditors Leeds 24 March 2005 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 92 Unaudited pro forma IFRS information The group currently prepares its accounts in accordance with the UK Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards together UK GAAP.
For the year ending 31 December 2005, the group will produce its accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS which differ significantly from UK GAAP in a number of areas.
In order to illustrate the impact of IFRS on the group, the following pro forma financial information for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been prepared which reconciles the UK GAAP financial information to that under IFRS.
The pro forma has been prepared on the basis of IFRS expected to be in effect for the year ending 31 December 2005.
The IFRS in effect at that date may change due to the EU endorsement process, the issue of any interpretative guidance issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee and changes in UK companies legislation.
The pro forma financial information reflects all necessary IFRS adjustments affecting profit and net assets but has not been prepared using an IFRS format of presentation.
The pro forma reconciliation is unaudited and the adjustments are explained in the notes below: Unaudited pro forma profit and loss account Audited IFRS adjustments unaudited Unaudited Revenue Share based UK GAAP & impairment Goodwill Pensions payments Derivatives Dividends IFRS m m m m m m m m note 1 note 2 note 3 note 4 note 5 note 6 note 7 note 8 Turnover UK home credit 490.5 67.9 558.4 Yes Car Credit 281.8 9.7 272.1 Vanquis Bank 6.7 0.8 5.9 International 235.036.2 271.2 Motor insurance note 9 152.7 152.7 1,166.7 93.6 1,260.3 Profit before taxation UK home credit 152.3 1.2 0.9 0.4 154.0 Yes Car Credit 4.4 7.0 0.1 2.7 Vanquis Bank 8.7 0.3 9.0 International 49.2 7.7 0.2 0.3 1.6 39.8 Motor insurance note 9 34.6 0.1 0.1 34.6 Central 11.1 0.3 0.4 11.2 220.7 13.8 1.5 1.3 1.6 205.5 Goodwill amortisation 4.6 4.6 216.1 13.8 4.6 1.5 1.3 1.6 205.5 Taxation 64.7 3.3 0.5 0.4 0.4 61.1 Profit after taxation 151.4 10.5 4.6 1.0 0.9 1.2 144.4 Dividends 87.3 2.4 84.9 Retained profit for the year 64.1 10.5 4.6 1.0 0.9 1.2 2.4 59.5 Earnings per share Basic p 59.74 57.00 Adjusted p 61.57 57.00 Provident Financial Annual Report & Accounts 2004 93 Unaudited pro forma IFRS information continued Unaudited pro forma statement of net assets Audited IFRS adjustments unaudited Unaudited Revenue Share based UK GAAP & impairment Goodwill Pensions payments Derivatives Dividends IFRS m m m m m m m m note 1 note 2 note 3 note 4 note 5 note 6 note 7 note 8 Fixed assets 144.0 4.6 148.6 Amounts receivable from customers 1,272.3 72.1 1,200.2 Investments and cash 500.1 500.1 Other assets 169.9 1.9 35.7 5.4 141.5 1,942.3 70.2 35.7 5.4 1,841.8 Bank and other borrowings 890.4 32.7 857.7 Pension liability 129.8 129.8 Dividends 52.7 52.7 Net tax liability asset 58.4 18.8 49.7 0.2 10.3 Other liabilities 559.3 0.6 0.1 39.3 599.1 1,560.8 18.2 80.1 0.1 6.4 52.7 1,576.3 Net assets 525.5 52.0 4.6 115.8 0.1 1.0 52.7 414.1 The UK GAAP net tax liability comprises a corporation tax creditor of 59.6 million plus the deferred tax provision of 2.8 million less overseas tax recoverable of 4.0 million.

2 Revenue recognition and impairment in home credit The service charge on a home credit loan is fixed.
The charge does not increase if customers take longer than the contracted period to repay the loan and there are no penalty or default interest charges.
Therefore, revenue is capped at the amount of the service charge.
Under UK GAAP, revenue in home credit is recognised by a combination of i an initial release to cover issue costs, ii an amount recognised in proportion to cash collections and iii a small amount released on a sum of digits method reflecting the funding cost of the amount advanced.
Under IFRS, the group is required to treat the service charge as if it were interest.
Revenue on loan receivables is recognised using an effective interest rate EIR.
This is calculated using contracted cash flows adjusted for the impact of customers repaying early but excluding the anticipated impact of customers paying late or not paying at all.
Directly attributable issue costs are also taken into account.
This approach can, and does, result in the recognition of revenue in excess of the amount to which the group is contractually entitled because revenue continues to be recognised on loans that are not fully repaid within the contracted term.
In addition to the change above, under IFRS the group recognises revenue more slowly as many of the costs covered by the initial release under UK GAAP do not qualify as directly attributable costs under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, bad debt provisions in home credit are based on a formulaic approach which is based on historical performance.
Under IFRS, impairment of the balance sheet value of customer receivables is calculated by estimating the future cash flows from a loan portfolio, discounting these to a present value using the EIR and comparing this figure with the balance sheet value.
An impairment provision is made for the shortfall between the present value and the balance sheet value and an impairment charge or credit to the profit and loss account results.
The recognition of revenue above that which the group is contractually entitled to causes an immediate impairment charge since no cash collection is expected.
This results in a grossing up of the impairment charge which goes to offset the grossing up of the revenue.
The gross up leads to an increase and distortion in the bad debt as a percentage of issue metric.
As a consequence, we will continue to disclose bad debt charge as a percentage of credit issued, as calculated under UK GAAP, for our home credit businesses as the most meaningful measure of credit quality.
Unfortunately, the relevant standard here, IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement was not written with the home collected credit sector in mind.
