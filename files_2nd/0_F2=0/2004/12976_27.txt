54 Accounting Policies 1 Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, and comply with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985 on a basis consistent with the previous year except for the changes detailed below.
The Groups profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings, and the Groups share of profits or losses and reserves of its joint ventures and associated undertakings.
The profits or losses of subsidiary undertakings acquired or sold during the period are included as from or up to the dates on which control passed.
All business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition accounting method.
Changes in accounting policy The Group has adopted Urgent Issues Task Force UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and abstract 17 2003 Employee share schemes in 2004.
UITF 38 requires investments in own shares to be deducted from equity and not disclosed as an investment.
In addition, in the cash flow statement, amounts paid to purchase own shares are disclosed as financing and not capital expenditure and financial investment.
UITF 17 2003 requires the cost of the shares awarded to be equal to the fair value of the shares at the grant date.
These changes in accounting policy have been accounted for as a prior period adjustment.
These changes reduce shareholders funds by Nil for the year ended 31 December 2003, and reduce cash outflow before use of liquid resources and financing by 3.7m for the year ended 31 December 2003.
There has been no restatement of the Groups profit and loss account as this change is not significant.
The Group has also adopted Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benefits FRS 17.
FRS 17 requires the assets and liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme to be recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
In addition, current service costs and net financial returns are included in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total gains and losses.
This change in accounting policy has also been accounted for as a prior period adjustment and accordingly the results reported in 2003 have been restated.
The change reduces shareholders funds for the year ended 31 December 2003 by 68.9m, net of deferred tax and reduces profit for the year ended 31 December 2003 by 6.1m, net of tax.

Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date except where a forward exchange contract has been arranged when the contracted rate is used.

The principal exchange rates against sterling affecting the Group were: 2004 2003 Year-end Average Year-end Average US dollar 1.92 1.84 1.79 1.63 Canadian dollar 2.30 2.40 2.31 2.32 Euro 1.41 1.46 1.42 1.45 3 Income recognition Turnover consists of sales of goods and services and is generally recognised as goods are shipped or services are rendered.

4 Contract advances The Deluxe businesses enter into contracts with major customers that span several years.
As part of these contracts, Deluxe provides advance cash payments to the customers.
Both Deluxe Media Services and Deluxe Film capitalise the total commitment payable under each contract within debtors at the date of the agreement and record a corresponding liability on the balance sheet for any outstanding unpaid amounts.
Within Deluxe Media Services, capitalised contract costs are amortised through the profit and loss account on the basis of units produced.
Within Deluxe Film, contract advances are amortised on the basis of estimated total footage over the life of the contract, unless the terms of the contract indicate an alternative treatment would be more appropriate.
The Rank Group Plc 55 5 Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions made before 31 December 1997 has been written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made subsequent to 31 December 1997 has been capitalised and is being amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life of 20 years or less.
6Stocks Stocks include work in progress and are valued at the lower of cost including an appropriate proportion of overhead and net realisable value.
7 Tangible xed assets Freehold properties are depreciated on a straight line basis over 50 years or their useful life, if less.
Leased properties are depreciated over the lesser of 50 years, their useful life or the term of the lease.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Expenditure on major refurbishment of properties is amortised over periods of between 3 and 15 years.
Other fixed assets are depreciated mainly at rates between 5% and 33% per annum on a straight line basis.
Pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.
Casino properties are depreciated over the useful economic life of the physical properties to their residual values.
Both the initial carrying amount and residual value take into account the trading potential of the property with the benefit of the casino licences.
8 Leased assets Assets acquired under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets.
Depreciation is provided at rates designed to write off the cost in equal annual amounts over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets which are the same as those for assets purchased outright and the period of the leases.
The capital element of future rentals is treated as a liability and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases in proportion to the balances outstanding.
Operating lease payments are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Any operating lease incentives are allocated to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period to which the lease incentive relates.
9 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill Fixed assets and goodwill identified as impaired are written down to the higher of post-tax net realisable value and value-in-use.
Appropriate discount rates and growth assumptions are used to determine value-in-use.
10 Investments Investments are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
11 Pensions The pension costs relating to the UK defined contribution scheme represent the contributions payable by the Group.
Overseas schemes are accounted for in accordance with local conditions and practice such that the costs are charged against profits on a systematic basis over the service lives of the employees.
The pension costs relating to the UK defined benefit scheme are accounted for using FRS 17.
Current service costs and net financial returns are included in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
12 Taxation Current tax is applied to taxable profits at the rates ruling in the relevant country.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse.
