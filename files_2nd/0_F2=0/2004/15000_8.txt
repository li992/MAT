Principal accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and the historical cost convention modified to include the revaluation of certain television studio properties in accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS15.
A summary of the Groups accounting policies, which have been applied consistently during the year, is set out below.
The profit and loss account is shown including and excluding exceptional items and the impact of goodwill amortisation under FRS10 in order to provide a fuller understanding of the underlying operations and performance of the Group.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the results of SMG plc the Company and all its subsidiaries and associated undertakings up to 31 December 2004.
As permitted under Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no separate profit and loss account for the holding company is presented.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from and up to the date at which control passed.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiarys assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values reflecting their condition at the acquisition date.
Associated undertakings In the consolidated financial statements, investments in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The Groups share of profits less losses of associated undertakings is included in the consolidated profit and loss account, and the Groups share of their net assets liabilities is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet.
These amounts are taken from the latest financial information available for the undertakings concerned.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associated undertakings is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out below.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associated undertakings.
Intangible fixed assets Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the surplus of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 1998 has been capitalised and is being amortised on a straight-line basis over the period which the Group expects to derive economic benefit from the assets.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was written off to reserves in accordance with the accounting standard then in force.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Freehold buildings are written off over their remaining useful lives, which are estimated to be in the range of 30 to 50 years.
Leasehold buildings are written off over the period of the leases.
Depreciation on plant, technical equipment and other assets is provided on a straight-line basis as follows: Plant and technical equipment between 5% and 20% Furniture and fittings between 10% and 20% Outdoor panels between 10% and 33% Computers and computer related equipment 20% Vehicles 25% No depreciation is provided with respect to freehold land.
Interest on tangible fixed assets in the course of construction is capitalised.
Rates of capitalisation depend on whether a specific loan has been taken out when the actual interest rate and interest paid are used or whether the construction has been financed by general borrowings when a weighted average is calculated on all non-specific borrowings.
63 Notes to the financial statements continued for the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Principal accounting policies continued Finance and operating leases Leasing agreements, which transfer to the Group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.
The assets are included within fixed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The lease rentals are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
The capital element is applied to reduce the outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged against profit so as to give a constant periodic rate of charge on the remaining balance outstanding at each accounting period.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The cost of raw materials and consumables represent purchase costs on a first in, first out basis.
Net realisable value is based on the estimated selling price less all further costs to be incurred prior to sale.
Film rights, recorded programmes and films Acquired film rights are valued at direct cost less appropriate provisions and are written off at 70% on first transmission and 30% on subsequent transmission.
Recorded programmes are valued at direct cost including labour and overheads, less appropriate provisions, and are written off after the first transmission or sale.
Programming made for third parties is valued at cost, less appropriate provisions, and is charged to the profit and loss account against related income.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract date.
Financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
Revenue recognition Turnover represents the amounts invoiced to customers less value added tax.
Key classes of revenue are recognised on the following basis: Airtime revenue on transmission Sponsorship evenly over the life of the contract Programme production on delivery Deferred taxation Deferred tax has been recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in future or a right to pay less tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax liabilities are not discounted.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that a transfer of economic benefit is more likely than not in the future.
Pension costs For defined benefit schemes, assets are measured at fair value.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the schemes liabilities.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit or loss.
The expected return on schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in net financing charges.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
For defined contribution schemes the amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contributions payable in the year.

An exceptional fixed asset provision amounting to 1.1m was made in 2003 to cover an impairment in the value of the Groups property at Cowcaddens.
This reflects the Groups plans to relocate the Scottish Television business to a new purpose-built facility.
The total impairment to fixed assets in 2003 was 4.2m, however, 3.1m was charged to the revaluation reserve as it represents a reversal of the studio property revaluation uplift in 2000. ii Gain on disposal of associate undertakings The disposal of the Companys investments in Scottish Radio Holdings plc SRH on 16 January 2004 and GMTV Limited GMTV on 12 October 2004 resulted in gains on disposal of 10.6m and 20.5m respectively see note 22. iii Gain on disposal of subsidiary undertaking In 2003, the disposal of the Companys Publishing division resulted in a provisional gain on sale of 33.0m.
In line with the sale and purchase agreement final agreement was reached with Gannet in July 2004 on the completion accounts net assets.
This resulted in a net payment due to Gannet and the provisional gain on sale was adjusted by 2.5 million during the first half of 2004. iv Reorganisation costs In 2003, a provision for exceptional costs amounting to 2.5m was made to cover reorganisation initiatives, primarily in the Groups television operations following the move of the Aberdeen studios to new state-of-the-art digital studios.
v Litigation matters As was disclosed within the 2002 annual report, the Group had received a legal claim from Chris Evans, one of the former shareholders in Ginger Media Group Limited, pursuing the final tranche of share-based consideration which would have been payable had all of his contractual terms been met.
The Group vigorously defended this matter and submitted a substantial counter-claim for damages.
On 26 June 2003 the court ruled that Chris Evans had broken the terms of his contract and that the Group acted properly in terminating his contract.
Mr Justice Lightman concluded that Chris Evans was not entitled to any of the share-based consideration he was claiming and dismissed his own claim for damages.
The judge also ruled that the Group was entitled to seek costs and damages from Chris Evans.
On 28 July 2003 the Group reached a full and final settlement with Chris Evans, which resulted in the Group receiving 6.7m covering all costs and damages in September 2003.
This settlement was recognised within the 2003 results as follows: the exceptional write off of legal and other costs incurred by the Group directly in defence of the claim of 3.7m: and the recognition of an offsetting exceptional credit of the recovery of these costs and associated damages of 6.7m.
vi Development costs The Group is committed to developing its radio business and has to date applied for a number of new FM regional radio licences offered by the Radio Authority, and subsequently Ofcom, as part of its remit to increase the number of analogue local licences.
An exceptional charge of 3.0m was made in 2003 to cover costs incurred bidding for radio licences.
vii Provision for onerous contracts In 2003, a provision of 3.8m was made with respect to an onerous sales contract covering bonus payments on sales of television airtime.
This contract was reviewed following the merger of Carlton and Granada airtime sales houses and replaced on more beneficial terms.
68 accounts 6 Exceptional items continued viii Writedown of investments A provision for 3.5m was made in 2003 against the investment in Heart of Midlothian plc Hearts to write off the remaining carrying value of the investment.
ix Financing charges a 6.7m of unamortised bank facility arrangement fees have been written off during the year.
The remaining unamortised balance was written off following the replacement of existing bank facilities with a new 158.0m five-year revolving credit and overdraft bank facility on improved terms.
This was completed in November 2004. b In April 2003, the Group made a payment of 35.8m to United States and United Kingdom note-holders in relation to exiting early from the high rate interest charges on this debt.
An exceptional provision of 15.0m was made in 2002 and the remaining exceptional cost of 20.8m was included in net financing charges during 2003.
7Associates Share of associates contribution includes the equity accounted results of GMTV, including related amortisation of goodwill of 0.3m 2003: 0.3m, to the date of disposal of the investment in October 2004.
