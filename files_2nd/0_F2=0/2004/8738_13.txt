No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties to their market value.
Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief.
The total amount unprovided for is approximately 6.9 million.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in respect of such properties in the foreseeable future.

The effect of this transaction is to remove any exposure to currency risk with regard to the settlement of this financial liability in 2009.
An analysis of the interest-rate profile of the financial liabilities, after taking account of all interest-rate swaps and the cross-currency swap on US senior loan notes, is set out in the following table.

All UK committed loan facilities are at floating rates based on LIBOR.
The company has entered into swap agreements which fix 150 million of these borrowings at a rate of 6.46% excluding bank margin.
At the balance sheet date, 185 million was drawn down under the revolving-loan facilities, with interest rates set for periods of between one week and six months, at which point monies are repaid and, if appropriate, redrawn.
The undrawn facility expires between four and five years.
In addition to the UK facilities, in September 1999, the company issued $140 million unsecured US senior notes due in 2009, carrying a fixed rate of interest of 8.48%.
The company entered into currency and swap agreements covering the duration of these notes which remove all US dollar exposure and convert the interest rate to one based on LIBOR.
