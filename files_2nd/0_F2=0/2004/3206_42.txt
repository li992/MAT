qxd 13 3 05 12:19 pm Page 65 26 Pensions Substantially all of the groups UK employees at 31 December 2004 were members of one of the three main schemes: the Centrica Pension Scheme formerly the Centrica Staff Pension Scheme, the Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme.
These schemes are defined benefit schemes and are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes.
The Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees whose benefits under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap.
Independent actuarial valuations for SSAP 24 purposes at 31 March 2004 showed aggregate actuarial asset values and those values relative to benefits due to members calculated on the basis of pensionable earnings and services on an ongoing basis using the projected unit method, as follows: Asset values relative to Asset values liabilities m % Centrica Pension Scheme 753 94 Centrica Engineers Pension Scheme 466 104 Centrica Management Pension Scheme 459 96 The long-term assumptions applied to calculate group pension costs, 2004 2003 as agreed with the independent actuary, are set out below: % % Rate of price inflation and pension increases 2.75 2.50 Annual rate of return on investments 7.00 6.70 Future increases in employee earnings 4.25 4.50 The groups pension costs arising and the reconciliation to the 2004 2003 balance sheet provision asset was as follows: m m Regular pension costs 99 105 Amortisation of surplus 4 21 95 84 Interest 2 10 Net pension costs 93 74 i ii Contributions paid 233 124 Decrease in provision for pension costs 140 50 v Disposal of subsidiary 50 Acquisition of pension liability 1 Pension provision at 1 January 5 55 Pension asset provision at 31 December 84 5 iii AA post-retirement private medical insurance 24 iv Direct Energy Marketing Limited DEML post-retirement benefits at 31 December 1 1 Pension and other retirement benefits asset provision see notes 15 and 19 83 30 Other retirement benefits i In December 2004 the company made a one-off contribution of 100 million.
ii Contributions paid, as stated in this table, do not include: one-off contributions due to redundancy that are shown against the restructuring provision 3 million and contributions to the DEML post-retirement benefits scheme 2 million giving total cash contributions of 238 million.
iii The group had a commitment to provide post-retirement private medical insurance cover for certain AA current and past employees.
This liability was materially extinguished under the terms of the sale of the AA.
The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was 2 million 2003: 3 million.
iv The group has a commitment to provide certain pension and other post-retirement benefits to employees of DEML.
The DEML pension plan was established on 1 March 2002 and an independent actuarial valuation carried out on 7 May 2002, which disclosed a surplus in respect of pension benefits of 6 million and a deficit in respect of non-pension post-retirement benefits of 4 million, resulting in a net surplus of 2 million.
The provision under this scheme as recognised under SSAP 24 was 1 million 2003: 1 million.
The net cost to the group of retirement benefits under this scheme was 2 million 2003: 2 million.
v Under the terms of the sale of AA Corporation Limited, the assets and liabilities relating to the AA Staff Pension Scheme, the AA Ireland Pension Scheme and substantially all the assets and liabilities relating to the AA post-retirement medical insurance scheme were transferred in full to AA Corporation Limited.
At disposal the SSAP 24 asset for these schemes was 24 million 245 million deficit under FRS 17, which represents AA pension schemes 50 million asset less AA post-retirement medical insurance scheme 26 million provision.
The disposal of AA Corporation Limited is expected to reduce ongoing pension costs by approximately 21 million per annum 34 million under FRS 17.
In addition, a number of AA employees are members of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme.
Liabilities with respect to these employees will be transferred to the AA Pension Scheme during 2005, provision for which has been made in calculating the profit on disposal of the AA see note 24 ii.
The opposite will be applied to Centrica group employees who are members of the AA pension schemes.
The total net cost to the group of other retirement benefits on a SSAP 24 basis was 4 million 2003: 5 million.

qxd 13 3 05 12:19 pm Page 66 Notes to the financial statements continued 26 Pensions continued Additional disclosures regarding the groups defined benefit pension schemes, the unapproved pension arrangement and the post-retirement medical plan are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out as at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2004, the unapproved pension scheme at 6 April 2002, the DEML pension plan at 7 May 2002 and the post-retirement medical liability at 31 December 2001.
These have been updated to 31 December 2004 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at market value.

Had FRS 17 been implemented in full at that date the net assets of the group would have been reduced by 558 million 2003: 720 million, and the net charge for pension costs in the profit and loss account would have decreased by 169 million 2003: 71 million increase compared with that under SSAP 24, as set out below: Increase FRS 17 SSAP 24 decrease FRS 17 SSAP 24 Increase 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 For the year ended 31 December m m m m m m Amount charged to operating profit 168 97 71 138 79 59 Amount charged to interest 5 5 12 12 Amount credited to profit and loss on disposal of the AA 245 245 Net credit charge to profit and loss account 72 97 169 150 79 71 2004 2003 Analysis of the amount that would have been charged to operating profit under FRS 17 m m Current service cost 148 135 Past service cost 4 3 Loss on curtailment 16 Net charge to operating profit 168 138 2004 2003 Analysis of the amount that would have been charged credited to interest under FRS 17 m m Expected return on pension scheme assets 173 149 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 178 161 Net charge to interest 5 12 Analysis of the actuarial gain loss that would have been recognised in the statement 2004 2003 of total recognised gains and losses m m Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 58 208 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 134 3 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 108 419 Actuarial gain loss to be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses before adjustment for tax 84 214 66 Annual report 2004 Centrica plc CT001 p35 82 vAW.

Under the projected unit method, used to value pension liabilities under FRS 17 for closed plans, the current service cost is expected to increase over time as members approach retirement.
27 Commitments and contingencies a Capital expenditure At 31 December 2004, the group had placed contracts for capital expenditure amounting to 86 million 2003: 74 million of which 37 million relates to the investment in customer relationship management infrastructure and billing systems 2003: 41 million.
b Decommissioning costs The group has provided certain guarantees and indemnities to BG Group plc in respect of the decommissioning costs of the Morecambe gas fields.
The company and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide security, in respect of such guarantees and indemnities, to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully discharged by the group.
The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields falls below 150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning.
The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and will remain in force unless and until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of Trade and Industry decommissioning notice in respect of the Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.
