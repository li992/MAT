Post-retirement liabilities Defined benefit schemes United Kingdom The principal pension plan operated for UK employees is the IMI Pension Fund, a defined benefit plan set up under trust so that the Fund's assets are held separately from those of the Company.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Fund for funding purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2002.
This valuation revealed that, under the methods and assumptions adopted, the Fund's assets were 106% of the accrued liabilities, allowing for projected future salary increases in the case of members in service.
The actuarial method used to calculate the pension cost was the projected unit method.
The most significant assumptions adopted were the real ie relative to the assumed rate of price inflation long-term rate of investment return at 3.9% pa and that this would exceed the increase in earnings by 2.4% pa and the increase in pensions by 3.9% pa.
Under the method and assumptions adopted, the value placed on the Fund's assets was 90% of the market value and 106% of the value placed on the accrued liabilities.
The market value of the assets as at 31 March 2002 was 915m.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is calculated by an independent actuary in such a way as to spread the cost of pensions over the average remaining service life of employees in membership.
For funding purposes, the cash contribution to the pension fund has continued to be in line with the full future service pension cost.
Overseas A number of local pension plans are operated for overseas employees.
Some of these plans are funded in a similar way to the UK Fund but others are 'book reserve' arrangements where the liability is shown on the balance sheet.
In total the overseas defined benefit plans had liabilities valued at approximately 69m of which 34m was in this type of 'book reserve' arrangement.
In the remaining funds assets of approximately 20m are currently held against liabilities of 35m.
Defined contribution schemes In addition to the above defined benefit schemes, the Group operates several defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the year to 31 December 2004 the total of employer contributions to these schemes was 7m.

Post-retirement liabilities continued FRS 17 disclosure The Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Pension costs.
Under FRS 17 Retirement benefits the following transitional disclosures are required: The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based upon the most recent actuarial reviews updated by the scheme actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
The most recent actuarial review of the main UK scheme was as at 31 March 2002.
Schemes have been aggregated below and weighted averages applied.
The major financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities at 31 December under FRS 17 are: 2004 2003 2002 UK Overseas UK Overseas UK Overseas %% %% % % Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 3.8 4.4 3.3 4.0 4.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8 1.1 2.7 0.9 2.3 1.4 Discount rate 5.3 5.2 5.4 5.7 5.6 6.2 Inflation assumption 2.8 2.0 2.7 2.0 2.3 2.9 The assets in the schemes and the expected long term rates of return at 31 December were: 2004 2003 2002 Rate of return UK Overseas UK Overseas UK Overseas %% %% % % Equities 8.0 8.2 8.1 8.2 8.2 8.0 Bonds 4.8 5.2 5.1 5.7 4.9 6.0 Property -- -- 7.2 - Other 4.0 3.2 4.0 5.0 4.0 5.5 6.9 6.5 7.0 7.0 7.0 7.2 2004 2003 2002 Value UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total m m m m m m m m m Equities 536 12 548 536 11 547 484 14 498 Bonds 260 3 263 216 4 220 235 5 240 Property -- - -- - 23- 23 Other 16 5 21 47 4 51 28 3 31 Total market value of assets 812 20 832 799 19 818 770 22 792 Present value of funded scheme liabilities 893 31 924 889 29 918 868 35 903 Deficit on funded schemes 81 11 92 90 10 100 98 13 111 Present value of unfunded scheme liabilities - 38 38 - 35 35 - 34 34 Deficit in all schemes 81 49 130 90 45 135 98 47 145 Related deferred tax asset 41 43 48 Net pension liability 89 92 97 72 IMI plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the financial statements Of the overseas unfunded liabilities of 24m 38m offset by associated deferred tax asset of 14m, 22m 34m less deferred tax of 12m is already recognised within the Group balance sheet on a SSAP24 basis, together with a pension prepayment of 4m see notes 15 and 19.
Full implementation of FRS 17 at 31 December 2004 would therefore have resulted in the recognition of a further liability of 71m as analysed below.
If FRS 17 had been adopted in the financial statements, the Group's net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 December would have been as follows: 2004 2003 m m Net assets Net assets per Group balance sheet 538 543 Add back unfunded pension liability net of deferred tax SSAP24 basis 22 20 Deduct pension prepayment 4 4 FRS 17 net pension liability 89 92 Net assets as adjusted 467 467 Reserves Profit and loss reserve per Group balance sheet 303 312 Add back unfunded pension liability net of deferred tax SSAP24 basis 22 20 Deduct pension prepayment 4 4 FRS 17 net pension liability 89 92 Profit and loss reserve as adjusted 232 236 73 IMI plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the financial statements 24.
Post-retirement liabilities continued The components of the defined benefit DB cost in the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses STRGL would have been as follows: 2004 2003 UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total m m m m m m Analysis of amounts charged to operating profits: Current service cost 10 2 12 10 2 12 Past service costs --- -- - Total charged to operating profit in respect of DB members 10 2 12 10 2 12 Analysis of other amounts charged to profit and loss account: Loss due to settlements --- 1 - 1 Loss due to curtailments --- - 1 1 Net loss charged to non-operating exceptional items --- 1 1 2 Analysis of amount credited to other finance income: Interest on pension scheme liabilities 46 3 49 48 4 52 Expected return on assets in the pension scheme 53 1 54 53 1 54 Net credit charge to other finance income 7 2 5 5 3 2 Total P&L charge before deduction for tax 3 4 7 6 6 12 Analysis of amounts recognised in STRGL: Gain loss on assets 28 - 28 55 1 54 Experience loss gain on liabilities 1 - 1 12 9 21 Loss on change of assumptions financial & demographic 22 5 27 59 2 61 Currency gain loss -11 - 1 1 History of experience gains and losses 2004 2003 2002 UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total m m m m m m m m m Analysis of the movement in deficit surplus in the schemes during the period: Gain loss on scheme assets Amount 28 - 28 55 1 54 163 12 175 % of scheme assets at end of period 3 2 3 7 5 7 21 55 22 Experience loss gain on scheme liabilities Amount 1 - 1 12 9 21 6 - 6 % of scheme liabilities at end of period -- - 114 2 1 - 1 Total actuarial gain loss recognised in STRGL Amount 5 4 1 8 6 14 169 18 187 % of scheme liabilities at end of period 1 5 - 1 9 1 20 26 20 74 IMI plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the financial statements 2004 2003 2002 UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total UK Overseas Total m m m m m m m m m Reconciliation of the movement in deficit surplus in the schemes during the period: Deficit surplus in the scheme at beginning of period 90 45 135 98 47 145 51 26 25 Estimated company contributions paid 74 11 63 9 3 3 6 Current service cost 10 2 12 10 2 12 15 2 17 Past service cost -- - - - - - 1 1 Settlement cost -- - 1 - 1 - - - Curtailment loss gain -- - - 1 1 20 - 20 Other finance income charge 7 2 5 5 3 2 12 2 10 Actuarial gain loss 5 5 - 8 6 14 169 18 187 Currency gain loss -1 1 - 1 1 - 1 1 Deficit in the scheme at end of period 81 49 130 90 45 135 98 47 145 25.

Contingencies The European Commission is investigating allegations of anti-competitive behaviour among certain manufacturers of copper fittings.
Notwithstanding IMI's disposal of its Copper Fittings businesses in 2002, it retains responsibility in relation to the European Commission's investigations in respect of those businesses.
A Statement of Objections is expected to be issued by the Commission during 2005.
It is not possible to give any reliable estimate of the likely level of fine.
Group contingent liabilities relating to guarantees in the normal course of business and other items amounted to 56m 2003: 49m.
There is a right of set-off with four of the Company's bankers relating to the balances of the Company and a number of its wholly-owned UK subsidiaries.
