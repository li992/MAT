Annual Report 2004 Vodafone Group Plc 73 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Basis of Consolidated Financial Statements Statutory financial information The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and in conformity with UK GAAP, which differ in certain material respects from US GAAP see note 36.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Amounts in the Consolidated Financial Statements are stated in pounds sterling, the currency of the country in which the Company is incorporated.
The translation into US dollars of the Consolidated Financial Statements as of, and for the financial year ended, 31 March 2004, is for convenience only and has been made at the Noon Buying Rate for cable transfers as announced by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for customs purposes on 31 March 2004.
This translation should not be construed as a representation that the sterling amounts actually represented have been, or could be, converted into dollars at this or any other rate.
The effect of changes in accounting policies as a result of changing accounting standards during the period, including the restatement of the balance sheets at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 and the consolidated cash flows for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 as a result of the application of UITF 38, is described in note 37 Changes in accounting standards.
Accounting policies The Groups material accounting policies are described below.
For a discussion on the Groups critical accounting estimates see Operating and Financial Review and Prospects Critical Accounting Estimates elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Accounting convention The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards of the United Kingdom Accounting Standards Board and pronouncements of its Urgent Issues Task Force.
Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and its share of the results of associated undertakings for financial statements made up to 31 March 2004.
A listing of the Companys principal subsidiary undertakings and associated undertakings is given in note 34.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates ruling on the dates of those transactions, adjusted for the effects of any hedging arrangements.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at year end rates.
The results of international subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange.
The adjustment to year end rates is taken to reserves.
Exchange differences, which arise on the retranslation of international subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings balance sheets at the beginning of the year, and equity additions and withdrawals during the financial year, are dealt with as a movement in reserves.
Other translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Turnover Group turnover comprises turnover of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings and excludes sales taxes, discounts and sales between Group companies.
Total Group turnover comprises Group turnover plus the Groups share of the turnover of its associated undertakings and joint ventures.
Turnover from mobile telecommunications comprises amounts charged to customers in respect of monthly access charges, airtime usage, messaging, the provision of other mobile telecommunications services, including data services and information provision, fees for connecting customers to a mobile network, revenues from the sale of equipment, including handsets and revenues arising from agreements entered into with partner networks.
Access charges and airtime used by contract customers are invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle and recognised as turnover over the related access period, with unbilled turnover resulting from services already provided from the billing cycle date to the end of each period accrued and unearned turnover from services provided in periods after each accounting period deferred.
Revenue from the sale of prepaid credit is deferred until such time as the customer uses the airtime, or the credit expires.
Other turnover from mobile telecommunications primarily comprises equipment sales, which are recognised upon delivery to customers, and customer connection revenues.
Customer connection revenues are recognised together with the related equipment revenue to the extent that the aggregate equipment and connection revenues do not exceed the fair value of the equipment delivered to the customer.
Any customer connection revenues not recognised together with related equipment revenues are deferred and recognised over the period in which services are expected to be provided to the customer.
Revenue from data services and information provision is recognised when the Group has performed the related service and depending on the nature of the service is recognised either at the gross amount billed to the customer or the amount receivable by the Group as commission for facilitating the service.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2004 74 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Turnover from other businesses primarily comprises amounts charged to customers of the Groups fixed line businesses, mainly in respect of access charges and line usage, invoiced and recorded as part of a periodic billing cycle.
Derivative financial instruments Transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken for risk management purposes only.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched against an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Gains or losses on interest rate instruments are matched against the corresponding interest charge or interest receivable in the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument.
For foreign exchange instruments, gains or losses and premiums or discounts are matched to the underlying transactions being hedged.
Termination payments made or received in respect of derivative financial instruments held for hedging purposes are spread over the life of the underlying exposure where the underlying exposure continues to exist.
Where the underlying exposure ceases to exist, termination payments are taken to the profit and loss account.
Pensions Costs relating to defined benefit plans, which are subject to periodic valuations calculated by professionally qualified actuaries, are charged against profits, within staff costs so that the expected costs of providing pensions are recognised during the period in which benefit is derived from the employees services.
The costs of the various pension schemes may vary from the funding, dependent upon actuarial advice, with any difference between pension cost and funding being treated as a provision or prepayment.
Defined contribution pension costs charged to the profit and loss account represent contributions payable in respect of the period.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Goodwill Goodwill is calculated as the surplus of fair value of consideration over fair value attributed to the identifiable net assets and liabilities excluding goodwill of subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings acquired.
For acquisitions made after the financial year ended 31 March 1998, goodwill is capitalised and held as a foreign currency denominated asset, where applicable.
Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
For acquired network businesses, whose operations are governed by fixed term licences, the amortisation period is determined primarily by reference to the unexpired licence period and the conditions for licence renewal.
The amortisation periods range between 3 and 20 years, with the exception of the goodwill arising on the formation of Verizon Wireless, which is amortised over 25 years.
The Group has assessed the renewal of Verizon Wireless licences as perfunctory and as such believes a useful economic life for the acquired business of greater than 20 years is appropriate.
For other acquisitions, including customer bases, the amortisation period for goodwill is typically between 3 and 10 years.
For acquisitions made before 1 April 1998, when FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, was adopted, goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
Goodwill written off directly to reserves is included in the profit and loss account when the related business is sold.
Other intangible fixed assets Purchased intangible fixed assets, including licence fees, are capitalised at cost.
Network licence costs are amortised over the periods of the licences.
Amortisation is charged from commencement of service of the network.
The annual charge is calculated in proportion to the capacity of the network during the start up period and on a straight line basis thereafter.
Other intangible fixed assets are amortised over their expected useful economic life on a straight line basis.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
The cost of other tangible fixed assets is written off, from the time they are brought into use, by equal instalments over their expected useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings 25-50 years Leasehold premises the term of the lease Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3-10 years The cost of tangible fixed assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Annual Report 2004 Vodafone Group Plc 75 Investments The Consolidated Financial Statements include investments in associated undertakings using the equity method of accounting.
An associated undertaking is an entity in which the Group has a participating interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence over its operational and financial policies.
The profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest income or expense and attributable taxation of those entities.
The balance sheet shows the Groups share of the net assets or liabilities of those entities, together with loans advanced and attributed goodwill.
The Consolidated Financial Statements include investments in joint ventures using the gross equity method of accounting.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has a long-term interest and exercises joint control.
Under the gross equity method, a form of the equity method of accounting, the Groups share of the aggregate gross assets and liabilities underlying the investment in the joint venture is included in the balance sheet and the Groups share of the turnover of the joint venture is disclosed in the profit and loss account.
Other investments, held as fixed assets, comprise equity shareholdings and other interests.
They are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
Dividend income is recognised upon receipt and interest when receivable.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Allowance for bad and doubtful debts Allowances are maintained for bad and doubtful debts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments.
Estimates are based on the ageing of the debt balances and historical experience.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that exist at the balance sheet date and that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax in the future.
The deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no binding commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the periods of the leases.
Assets acquired under finance leases, which transfer substantially all the rights and obligations of ownership, are accounted for as though purchased outright.
The fair value of the asset at the inception of the lease is included in tangible fixed assets and the capital element of the leasing commitment included in creditors.
Finance charges are calculated on an actuarial basis and are allocated over each lease to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance.
Lease obligations which are satisfied by cash and other assets deposited with third parties are set-off against those assets in the Groups balance sheet.

The effective rate includes the impact of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, which may not be deductible for tax purposes.
Aside from the negative impact of non-tax deductible goodwill amortisation on the effective tax rate, the Groups tax charge has benefited further from the restructuring of Italian operations in the prior year, from restructuring of the French operations in the current year, from a fall in the Groups weighted average tax rate, calculated by reference to local statutory tax rates and accounting profits, and from other tax incentives.
These benefits have outweighed the absence of the one-off benefit arising from the restructuring of the German group in the previous year.
The tax charge on exceptional items of 104 million 2003: 37 million: 2002: 71 million is mainly in respect of expected recoveries and provision releases in relation to a contribution tax levy on Vodafone Italy that is no longer expected to be payable.

At 31 March 2004, the Group had the following trading and non-trading losses available for carry forward.
These losses are available for offset against future trading and non-trading profits of certain Group and associated undertakings: m UK subsidiaries trading and non-trading losses 166 International subsidiaries trading and non-trading losses 37,932 The losses in respect of international subsidiaries include amounts of 30,728 million 2003: 34,142 million that have arisen in overseas holding companies as a result of revaluations of those companies investments for local GAAP purposes.
Since it is uncertain whether or not these losses will be utilised, no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

In accordance with accounting standards the Group regularly monitors the carrying value of its fixed assets.
A review was undertaken at 31 March 2004 to assess whether the carrying value of assets was supported by the net present value of future cash flows derived from assets using cash flow projections for each asset in respect of the period to 31 March 2014.
Cash flow projections for the mobile businesses reflect investment in network infrastructure to provide enhanced voice services and a platform for new data products and services, enabled by GPRS and 3G technologies, which are forecast to be significant drivers of future revenue growth.
Capital expenditure is heaviest in the early years of the projections, but in most countries is expected to fall to below 10% of revenues by the year ended 31 March 2008.
Revenue growth is forecast from a combination of new customers and enhanced customer propositions.
Data revenue is expected to increase significantly to 2009 but grow at more modest rates to 2014.
Voice ARPU is forecast to benefit in the longer term from new services and traffic moving from fixed networks to mobile networks following a period of stabilisation reflecting the impact of price declines.
Accordingly, the directors believe that it is appropriate to use projections in excess of five years as growth in cash flows for the period to 31 March 2014 is expected to exceed relevant country growth in nominal gross domestic product GDP.
For the years beyond 1 April 2014, forecast growth rates at nominal GDP, using rates from independent sources, have been assumed for mobile businesses and below nominal GDP for non-mobile businesses.
The discount rates for the major markets reviewed were based on company specific pre-tax weighted average cost of capital percentages and ranged from 8.1% to 10.3%.
The results of the review undertaken at 31 March 2004 indicated that no impairment charge was necessary.

Financial instruments Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The carrying amounts and estimated fair value of the Groups outstanding financial instruments are set out below: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Net carrying Estimated Net carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Fixed asset investments excluding investments in joint ventures and 1 associated undertakings 1,049 1,290 1,164 1,027 Cash at bank and in hand 1,409 1,409 475 475 Liquid investments 4,381 4,381 291 291 Borrowings: Short term 1,974 2,034 1,356 1,371 Long term 12,224 13,029 13,175 14,173 Derivative financial instruments: Interest rate 343 683 Foreign exchange 80 80 74 74 Note: 1 Restated as a result of the adoption of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
The Groups exposure to market risk, which is the sensitivity of the value of financial instruments to changes in related currency and interest rates, is minimised because gains and losses on the underlying assets and liabilities offset gains and losses on derivative financial instruments.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values shown above.
Fixed asset investments excluding investments in joint ventures and associated undertakings The net book value of fixed asset investments at 31 March 2004 comprises investments recorded at an original cost of 2,079 million 2003: 2,568 million.
Listed investments are stated at fair value based on their quoted share price at 31 March 2004.
Cash at bank and in hand and liquid investments The carrying values of cash and liquid investments approximate to their fair values because of the short term maturity of these instruments.
Borrowings excluding foreign exchange contracts The fair value of quoted long term borrowings is based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The book values stated above excludes accrued interest on borrowings which is recorded separately on the balance sheet within accruals and deferred income.
The fair value of other borrowings is estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest and foreign currency rates prevailing at the year end.
Foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and futures The Group enters into foreign exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and futures in order to manage its foreign currency and interest rate exposure.
The book values stated above exclude accrued interest which is recorded separately in the balance sheet.
The fair value of these financial instruments was estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest and foreign currency rates prevailing at the year end.
Hedges The Groups policy is to use derivative instruments to hedge against exposure to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are set out below: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2003 721 39 682 Less: gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 211 18 193 Gains and losses arising before 1 April 2003 that were not recognised at 31 March 2004 510 21 489 Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised at 31 March 2004 87 59 146 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2004 423 80 343 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in the year ending 31 March 2005 91 23 68 In addition to the amounts disclosed above, cumulative aggregate gains of 607 million in respect of terminated interest rate swaps were carried forward in the balance sheet as at 31 March 2004 pending their recognition in the profit and loss account 2003: 415 million.
Of these carried forward amounts, gains of 155 million are expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account in the 2005 financial year.
Aggregate related gains of 90 million from previous years were recognised in the profit and loss account in the 2004 financial year 2003: 53 million.
Currency exposures Taking into account the effect of forward contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group did not have any material financial exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at 31 March 2004.

Therefore the net deferred tax charge is 742 million 2003: 812 million, or 736 million 2003: 818 million before exceptional items.
The net deferred tax liability asset is analysed as follows: 2004 2003 m m Accelerated capital allowances 1,652 1,383 Deferred tax on closure of derivative financial instruments 13 48 Deferred tax on overseas earnings 1,425 1,007 Other short term timing differences 19 28 Unrelieved tax losses 402 306 2,643 2,008 Analysed as: Deferred tax asset note 15 965 1,024 Deferred tax provision 3,608 3,032 2,643 2,008 The amounts unprovided for deferred taxation are: 2004 2003 m m Accelerated capital allowances 6 170 Gains subject to rollover relief 10 10 Other short term timing differences 118 165 Unrelieved tax losses 11,018 11,226 11,132 11,551 A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of unrelieved tax losses of 11,018 million 2003: 11,226 million, accelerated capital allowances of 6 million 2003: 170 million and short term timing differences of 118 million 2003: 165 million as it is not anticipated that sufficient taxable profits will arise within the foreseeable future.
The potential net tax benefit in respect of all tax losses carried forward at 31 March 2004, including amounts both recognised and unrecognised for deferred tax purposes, was 50 million in United Kingdom subsidiaries 2003: 52 million and 11,370 million in international subsidiaries 2003: 11,480 million.
These losses are only available for offset against future profits arising within these companies subject to the laws of the relevant jurisdiction.
The Groups share of losses of international associated undertakings that are available for offset against future trading profits in these entities is nil 2003: 225 million.
Other provisions Other provisions primarily comprise amounts provided for legal claims, decommissioning costs and restructuring costs.
The associated cash outflows for restructuring costs are substantially short term in nature.
For decommissioning costs, the associated cash outflows are generally expected to occur at the dates of exit of the assets to which they relate, which are long term in nature.
The timing of cash outflows associated with legal claims cannot be reasonably determined.

Sharesave Scheme The Vodafone Group 1998 Sharesave Scheme the Sharesave Scheme enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly savings of up to 250 over a three or five year period, at the end of which they also receive a tax free bonus.
The savings and bonus may then be used to purchase shares at the option price, which is set at the beginning of the savings contract and usually at a discount of 20% to the then prevailing market price of the Companys shares.
Invitations to participate in this scheme are normally made annually.
Discretionary share option plans The Company has two discretionary share option plans, the Vodafone Group 1998 Company Share Option Scheme which is UK Inland Revenue approved and the Vodafone Group 1998 Executive Share Option Scheme which is unapproved.
Options under the discretionary schemes are subject to performance conditions.
Options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Long Term Stock Incentive Plan The Vodafone Group Plc 1999 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan is a discretionary plan under which both share option grants and share awards may be made.

For all other grants, options are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of predetermined performance conditions and are exercisable in respect of ordinary shares listed on the London Stock Exchange, or ADSs for US employees.
Share option plans belonging to subsidiaries Share option schemes are also operated by certain of the Groups subsidiary and associated undertakings, under which options are only issued to key personnel.
Share Plans Share Incentive Plan The Share Incentive Plan enables UK staff to acquire shares in the Company through monthly purchases of up to 125 per month or 5% of salary, whichever is lower.
For each share purchased by the employee, the Company provides a free matching share.

Under UK GAAP, the total goodwill capitalised in respect of transactions has been provisionally assessed as 1,544 million of which 1,434 million is in respect of subsidiary undertakings and 110 million is in respect of associated undertakings.

Employees An analysis of the average number of employees by category of activity is shown below.
Of total average employees, 17% were based in the United Kingdom 2003: 15%, 2002: 16%.
Pensions As at 31 March 2004, the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
All the Groups pension plans are provided either through defined benefit or defined contribution arrangements.
Defined benefit schemes provide benefits based on the employees length of pensionable service and their final pensionable salary or other criteria.
Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds that are converted into benefits at the time of retirement.
Further details on the three principal defined benefit pension schemes, in the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan are shown below.
In addition to the principal schemes, the Group operates defined benefit schemes in Greece, Ireland, Italy, Sweden and the United States.
Defined contribution pension schemes are provided in Australia, Egypt, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.
There is a post retirement medical plan in the United States for a small closed group of participants.
The Group accounts for its pension schemes in accordance with SSAP 24, Accounting for pension costs.
Scheme liabilities are assessed by independent actuaries using the projected unit funding method using the principal actuarial assumptions as set out in Pension disclosures required under SSAP 24 below.
Assets are shown at market value.
Additional disclosures required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17, Retirement benefits are also set out below.
The bases of calculation under FRS 17 are significantly different to SSAP 24.
Whilst both require use of formal actuarial valuations, FRS 17 requires the use of a different set of underlying assumptions and also specifies more frequent valuation updates.
Accordingly, if FRS 17 is implemented in full, the Groups reported pension costs and balance sheet position are likely to change.
United Kingdom The majority of the UK employees are members of the Vodafone Group Pension Scheme the main scheme.
This is a tax approved scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee-administered fund.
In addition there is an internally funded unapproved defined benefit plan in place for a small number of senior executives.
The Group also operates a funded unapproved defined contribution scheme for certain senior executives.
The pension cost for all three arrangements is included in the summary information shown below.
The main scheme is subject to quarterly funding updates by independent actuaries and to formal actuarial valuations at least every three years.
The most recent formal valuation of this scheme was carried out as at 31 March 2001.
At 31 March 2001, the market valuation of the main scheme assets of 177 million was sufficient to cover 84% of the benefits accrued to members using the assumptions set out within Pension disclosures required under SSAP 24.
The funding level as at 31 March 2003 was reviewed and as a result the UK companies made special lump sum contributions of 50 million during the 2004 financial year, in addition to ongoing contributions of 13% of pensionable earnings.
The variation in regular cost under SSAP 24 was also changed as a result of the review.
The contributions payable over the coming year will be determined by the results of the formal valuation of the main scheme as at 31 March 2004 which is currently underway.
The updated funding level as at 31 March 2004 has been estimated as 116%, using financial assumptions consistent with those of the last formal valuation.
An accurate figure for this funding level, including the impact of any changes in demographic assumptions, will be obtained once the next valuation is completed.
As a result of the acceleration of payments, a net prepayment of 193 million 2003: 136 million is included in debtors due after more than one year, representing the excess of the amounts funded over accumulated pension costs.
Germany There are a number of separate pension and associated arrangements in Germany, one of which is fully externally financed and a number of which are funded through a trust arrangement.
The German schemes are subject to annual valuations, with the last formal valuations having been completed as at 31 March 2004.
At 31 March 2004, the total pension liability for benefits funded through the trust arrangement was 171 million, using the assumptions as set out within Additional disclosures in respect of FRS 17, and the market value of the trust arrangement was 155 million representing a funding level of 91%.
The total pension liability for the externally funded benefits was 10 million and the market value of the schemes assets for the externally funded benefits also amounted to 10 million representing a funding level of 100%.
A contribution of 54 million was made into the trust arrangement and 2 million was made into the externally funded arrangement during the 2004 financial year.
An amount of 14 million 2003: 64 million is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, representing the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amounts funded externally and reflects the internally funded nature of part of the principal arrangements.
Japan There are a number of separate pension schemes in relation to employees in Japan and these are not generally funded, with any shortfall in external funding being accrued within provisions.
The Japanese schemes are subject to valuations at intervals of between one and two years, with the last formal valuations being prepared at 31 March 2002.
At 31 March 2002, the total pension liability for the internally funded benefits was 110 million using the assumptions set out within Pension disclosures required under SSAP 24.
The total pension liability for the externally funded benefits was 5 million and the market value of the schemes assets for the externally funded benefits amounted to 1 million representing a percentage cover of accrued benefits for members of 20%.
An amount of 26 million 2003: 88 million is included in provisions for liabilities and charges, representing the excess of the accumulated pension costs over the amounts funded externally and reflects the internally funded nature of the principal arrangements.
Annual Report 2004 Vodafone Group Plc 107 Pension disclosures required under SSAP 24 During the year ended 31 March 2004, the total amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of all the Groups pensions plans was 79 million 2003: 95 million, 2002: 64 million, as analysed below: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Defined benefit schemes: United Kingdom 31 24 24 Germany 7 12 14 Japan 10 32 6 Other Countries 6 54 Net pension charge: Defined benefit schemes 54 73 48 Net pension charge: Defined contribution schemes 25 22 16 Total amount charged to the profit and loss account 79 95 64 Below is a summary of the principal assumptions used in calculating the pension cost for the year to 31 March 2004: UK Germany Japan %%% Rate of inflation 2.5 1.5 1 Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 3.5 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.5 1.5 N A Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.5 N A Rate used to discount liabilities pre-retirement 7.0 6.0 1.8 Rate used to discount liabilities post-retirement 6.0 6.0 1.8 Notes: 1 Rate of increase in salaries in Japan is calculated in line with company specific experience where benefits are salary related.
The components of the total pension costs of the three principal defined benefit schemes were as follows: 2 UK Germany Japan 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m m m Regular cost 23 22 5 5 8 12 Interest credit cost 9 4 4 9 1 2 1 Variation in regular cost 17 6 2 2 1 18 Total 31 24 7 12 10 32 Notes: 1 The variation in regular cost was calculated by amortising the shortfall at the date of the last formal valuation or review over the future working lives of members on a percentage of pensionable salary basis.
For the purposes of determining the UK SSAP 24 variation in regular cost, a review was undertaken as at 31 March 2003 to reflect the impact of investment market movements.
The charge for Japan in the year ended 31 March 2003 also included 17 million in respect of lump sum redundancy benefits payable through a redundancy programme associated with the retirement plan.
2 The charge for Japan includes the pension costs in relation to companies sold during the year for that part of the year prior to their disposal.

The deficits reported under FRS 17 reflect the different assumptions for valuing assets and liabilities compared with SSAP 24.
The funding policy for the German and UK schemes is reviewed on a systematic basis in consultation with the independent scheme actuary in order to ensure that the funding contributions from sponsoring employers are appropriate to meet the liabilities of the schemes over the long term.
The deficit in respect of other schemes at 31 March 2004 primarily relates to internally funded schemes in Italy, Sweden and the United States and the externally funded scheme in Ireland.

The Group now shows amounts previously reported as other related to licence fee amortisation as a separate line item in the reconciliation.
In addition, the Group now reflects only the Groups interest in each adjustment.
These reclassifications had no impact on the Groups previously reported net loss or shareholders equity under US GAAP.

The Groups retrospective adoption of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts resulted in the UK GAAP equity shareholders funds and total assets for prior years being restated see note 37.
The reconciliations of shareholders equity and total assets have been restated to reflect this change in UK GAAP reporting which had no effect on previously reported US GAAP net income, shareholders equity or total assets.

Annual Report 2004 Vodafone Group Plc 117 Summary of differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP, which differ in certain material respects from US GAAP.
The differences that are material to the Group relate to the following items.
a Non-consolidated entities and investments accounted for under the equity method Under UK GAAP, the results and assets of Vodafone Italy have been consolidated in the Groups financial statements from 12 April 2000.
Under US GAAP, as a result of significant participating rights held by minority shareholders, the Groups interest in Vodafone Italy has been accounted for as an associated undertaking under the equity method of accounting.
Under UK GAAP, Vodafone Spain has been consolidated in the Groups financial statements from 29 December 2000.
Under US GAAP, the Groups interests in Vodafone Spain, have been accounted for as an associated undertaking under the equity method of accounting up to 29 June 2001 and consolidated thereafter, following the completion of the acquisition of a further 17.8% shareholding.
Under UK GAAP, charges for interest and taxation for associated undertakings are aggregated within the Group interest and taxation amounts shown on the face of the consolidated profit and loss account.
The Groups share of the turnover of associated undertakings is also permitted to be disclosed on the face of the consolidated profit and loss account.
US GAAP does not permit the Groups share of turnover of associated undertakings to be disclosed on the face of the consolidated income statement.
Equity accounting for Vodafone Italy and Vodafone Spain under US GAAP results in the Group operating loss, Group net interest payable, Group taxation payable and equity minority interests being less than more than the equivalent UK GAAP amount by 1,325 million, 55 million, 583 million and 459 million 2003: 1,955 million, 45 million, 478 million and 264 million: 2002: 2,060 million, 9 million, 402 million and 249 million, respectively.
Equity accounting for Vodafone Italy and Vodafone Spain results in the Groups share of the operating loss, interest payable and taxation payable of associated undertakings being greater lower under US GAAP than UK GAAP by 1,907 million, 42 million and 448 million 2003: 2,305 million, 34 million and 367 million: 2002: 2,402 million, 7 million and 307 million, respectively.
The Groups investment in the entity consolidated under UK GAAP but equity accounted under US GAAP at 31 March 2004 was 24,028 million 2003: 21,512 million.
b Connection revenues and costs The Groups UK GAAP accounting policy on revenue recognition was amended during the year in relation to the deferral of certain equipment, connection, upgrade and tariff migration fees following the issuance of Application Note G to FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions.
Following the prospective adoption of EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables on 1 October 2003 under US GAAP the Groups UK and US GAAP accounting policies have been substantially aligned.
For transactions prior to 1 October 2003, connection revenues under US GAAP are recognised over the period that a customer is expected to remain connected to a network.
Connection costs directly attributable to the income deferred are recognised over the same period.
Where connection costs exceed connection revenues, the excess costs were charged in the profit and loss account immediately upon connection.
The balances of deferred revenue and deferred charges as of 30 September 2003 will continue to be recognised over the period that a customer is expected to remain connected to a network.
c Goodwill and other intangible assets Under UK GAAP, the policy followed prior to the introduction of FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, which is effective for accounting periods ended on or after 23 December 1998 and was adopted on a prospective basis, was to write off goodwill against shareholders equity in the year of acquisition.
FRS 10 requires goodwill to be capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful economic life.
Under US GAAP, following the introduction of SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, which was effective for accounting periods starting after 15 December 2001 and, transitionally, for acquisitions completed after 30 June 2001, goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are capitalised and not amortised, but tested for impairment, at least annually, in accordance with SFAS No.
Intangible assets with finite lives continue to be capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives.
The Group believes that the nature of the licences and the related goodwill acquired in business combinations is substantially indistinguishable.
In acquisitions where the primary asset is a licence, the Group, therefore, allocates the surplus of the purchase price over the fair value attributed to the share of net assets acquired to licences.
In a number of the Groups previous acquisitions, the primary assets acquired were licences to provide mobile telecommunications services.
As a result of the adoption of SFAS 142 and these considerations, on 1 April 2002, 33,664 million of goodwill was reclassified as licences.
In accordance with the provision of SFAS No.
109, Accounting for Income Taxes, a related deferred tax liability and a corresponding increase to licence value of 19,077 million has also been recognised related to the resulting difference in the tax basis versus the book basis of the licences.
Under UK GAAP and US GAAP the purchase price of a transaction accounted for as an acquisition is based on the fair value of the consideration.
In the case of share consideration, under UK GAAP the fair value of such consideration is based on the share price at completion of the acquisition or the date when the transaction becomes unconditional.
Under US GAAP the fair value of the share consideration is based on the average share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the proposed acquisition is agreed to and announced.
This has resulted in a difference in the fair value of the consideration for certain acquisitions and consequently in the amount of goodwill capitalised under UK GAAP and US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, costs incurred in reorganising acquired businesses are charged to the profit and loss account as post-acquisition expenses.
Under US GAAP, certain of such costs are considered in the allocation of purchase consideration.
d Licence fee amortisation Under UK GAAP, the Group has adopted a policy of amortising licence fees in proportion to the capacity of the network during the start up period and then on a straight line basis.
Under US GAAP, licence fees are amortised on a straight line basis from the date that operations commence to the date the licence expires.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2004 118 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 36.
US GAAP information continued e Exceptional items In the year ended 31 March 2003, the Group recorded an impairment charge under UK GAAP of 405 million in relation to the fixed assets of Japan Telecom.
Under US GAAP, the Group evaluated the recoverability of these fixed assets in accordance with the requirements of SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets, and determined that the carrying amount of these assets was recoverable.
As a result, the UK GAAP impairment charge of 405 million 270 million net of minority interests was not recognised under US GAAP during the year ended 31 March 2003.
On disposal of Japan Telecom in the year ended 31 March 2004, an incremental loss on sale of 476 million 351 million net of minority interests was recognised under US GAAP resulting in a total loss on sale of 555 million 399 million net of minority interests.
The reconciling item arising in the year ended 31 March 2002 represented the loss on sale of a business, which was sold fifteen months after the date of acquisition.
Under UK GAAP, the fair value of an acquired business can be amended up until the end of the financial year after acquisition.
Under US GAAP, the fair value can only be adjusted for one year following acquisition.
In addition, the exceptional non-operating items recorded under UK GAAP, disclosed in note 6, are reclassified as operating items under US GAAP and reduce operating profit accordingly.
f Capitalised interest Under UK GAAP, the Groups policy is not to capitalise interest costs on borrowings in respect of the acquisition of tangible and intangible fixed assets.
Under US GAAP, the interest cost on borrowings used to finance the construction of network assets is capitalised during the period of construction until the date that the asset is placed in service.
Interest costs on borrowings to finance the acquisition of licences are also capitalised until the date that the related network service is launched.
Capitalised interest costs are amortised over the estimated useful lives of the related assets.
g Income taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided in full on all temporary differences and a valuation adjustment is established in respect of those deferred tax assets where it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realised.
The most significant component of the income tax adjustment is due to the temporary difference between the assigned values and tax values of intangible assets acquired in a business combination, which results in the recognition of a deferred tax liability under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, no deferred tax liability is recognised.
Under UK GAAP, the tax benefit received on the exercise of share options by employees, being the tax on the difference between the market value on the date of exercise and the exercise price, is shown as a component of the tax charge for the period.
Under US GAAP, the tax benefit for deductions not exceeding the US GAAP accounting charge is recognised in earnings.
Any incremental tax benefit from tax deductions in excess of the US GAAP accounting charge is shown as a component of paid-in capital on issue of shares.
In addition, deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductions and utilisation of tax carry-forwards, subject to a valuation allowance.
The valuation allowance established against deferred tax assets as at 31 March 2004 was 11,150 million 2003: 11,446 million, the movement in the year being 296 million.
The valuation allowance is mainly in respect of tax losses amounting to 11,018 million 2003: 11,226 million not recognised.
h Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, final dividends are included in the financial statements when recommended by the Board to the shareholders in respect of the results for a financial year.
Under US GAAP, dividends are included in the financial statements when declared by the Board.
i Other Pension costs Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP pension costs provide for future pension liabilities.
There are differences, however, in the prescribed methods of valuation, which give rise to GAAP adjustments to the pension cost and the pension prepayment liability.
In addition, in certain circumstances an additional minimum liability must also be recognised with changes therein reported net of tax in other comprehensive income.
Capitalisation of computer software costs Under UK GAAP, costs that are directly attributable to the development of computer software for continuing use in the business, whether purchased from external sources or developed internally, are capitalised.
Under US GAAP, data conversion costs and costs incurred during the research stage of software projects are not capitalised.
Marketable securities Under US GAAP, SFAS No.
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, the Group classifies its marketable equity securities with readily determinable fair values as available for sale and are stated at fair value with the unrealised loss or gain, net of deferred taxes, reported in comprehensive income.
Under UK GAAP such investments are generally carried at cost and reviewed for other than temporary impairment.
Minority interests Where losses in a subsidiary undertaking attributable to the minority interest result in its interest being one in net liabilities, UK GAAP requires a parent company make provision only to the extent it has a commercial or legal obligation to provide funding that may not be recoverable in respect of the accumulated losses attributable to the minority interest.
US GAAP requires all losses allocable to minority interests in excess of their interest in the equity of the respective subsidiary to be charged to the majority shareholder.
Annual Report 2004 Vodafone Group Plc 119 Stock based compensation Under UK GAAP, options granted over the Companys ordinary shares are accounted for using the intrinsic value method, with the difference between the fair value of shares at grant date and the exercise price charged to the profit and loss over the period until the shares first vest.
Grants under the Companys SAYE schemes are exempt from this accounting methodology.
Under US GAAP, the Group accounts for option plans in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Principles Board APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and applies the disclosure provisions of SFAS No.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure.
Under APB 25, such plans are accounted for as variable and the cost is calculated by reference to the market price of the shares at the measurement date and amortised over the period until the shares first vest.
Where the measurement period has not yet been completed, the cost is calculated by reference to the market price of the relevant shares at the end of each accounting period.
Derivative instruments All the Groups transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken for risk management purposes only and are used to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
In accordance with UK GAAP, to the extent that such instruments are matched against an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for as hedging transactions and recorded at appropriate historical amounts, with fair value information disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements.
Under US GAAP, in accordance with SFAS No.
133, the Groups derivative financial instruments, together with any separately identified embedded derivatives, are reported as assets or liabilities on the Groups balance sheet at fair value.
In a hedge of fair values, changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in earnings with a corresponding change in the fair value of the hedged item also being recorded in earnings.
For hedges of future cash flows, the changes in fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings when the hedged item affects earnings.
Under US GAAP, all changes in fair value of derivatives not designated in hedging relationships are accounted for in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The Group does not pursue hedge accounting treatment for: interest rate futures, which are typically used to switch floating interest rates to fixed interest rates: or derivatives entered into for funding and liquidity purposes, including forwards: or individual contracts where the underlying value of the transactions amounts to less than 10 million.
Upon first adopting SFAS No.
133, on 1 April 2002, a cumulative transition adjustment was made which increased US GAAP net income and other comprehensive income by 17 million and nil, respectively.
j Comprehensive loss income Total recognised losses under UK GAAP include net loss and currency translation adjustment.
Under US GAAP, comprehensive loss income is the change in equity during a period resulting from transactions other than with shareholders.
Comprehensive loss income is comprised of net loss, the minimum pension liability adjustment, changes in the fair value of available for sale securities and derivatives used in cash flow hedging relationships, and currency translation adjustment.
k Loss per share Loss per share information is calculated based on: 2004 2004 2003 2002 $ in millions, except per share amounts Loss from continuing operations 14,231 7,734 9,135 16,444 Loss income on operations and disposal of discontinued operations 723 393 80 261 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 17 Net loss 14,954 8,127 9,055 16,688 Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding 68,096 68,096 68,155 67,961 Basic and diluted loss per share: Loss from continuing operations 20.90 11.36 p 13.40 p 24.20 p Loss income on operations and disposal of discontinued operations 1.05 0.57 p 0.11p 0.38 p Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 0.02p Net loss 21.95 11.93 p 13.29 p 24.56 p There were no securities with a dilutive effect for the year ended 31 March 2004.
The Group has not included 382 million shares 2002: 246 million in the computation of diluted loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2003 as their inclusion would be antidilutive.
Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2004 120 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 36.
US GAAP information continued Market risk and financial instruments The principal financial risks arising from the Groups activities are funding risk, interest rate risk, currency risk and counterparty risk.
The Group manages these risks by a variety of methods, including the use of a number of financial instruments.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken for risk management purposes only, by specialist treasury personnel.
No instruments are held by the Group for trading purposes.
The Groups treasury function provides a centralised service to the Group for funding, foreign exchange, interest rate management and counterparty risk management, with operations, including transactions in derivative financial instruments, conducted within a policy framework approved by the Board.
Interest rate risk The Groups main interest rate exposures are to euro and yen, and, to a lesser extent US dollar and sterling interest rates.
Under the Groups interest rate management policy, interest rates on monetary assets and liabilities are maintained on a floating rate basis, unless the forecast interest charge for the next eighteen months is material in relation to forecast results, in which the interest rates are fixed.
In addition, fixing may be undertaken for longer periods when interest rates are statistically low.
The term structure of interest rates is managed within limits approved by the Board, using derivative financial instruments such as swaps, futures, options and forward rate agreements.
At the end of the year, 20% 2003: 9% of the Groups gross borrowings were fixed for a period of at least one year.
Foreign exchange rate risk The Groups geographical spread exposes it to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.
The Group manages its exposure to foreign currency movements by hedging known future transactions, including those resulting from the repatriation of international dividends and loans.
Foreign exchange forward contracts are the derivative instrument most used for this purpose.
Investments in foreign entities Although the Group reports its balance sheet in sterling, which is the principal currency for most transactions undertaken in its shares, it does not hedge its foreign currency balance sheet exposure for three reasons.
Firstly, the Group believes its shareholders principally value its shares by discounting its estimated future sterling and foreign currency cash flows and converting to sterling at appropriate rates where necessary.
Secondly, the Group manages the currency of its net debt according to banded multiples of its operating cash flow, adjusted for dividends and share purchases, for those currencies.
As such at 31 March 2004, 117% of net borrowings were denominated in currencies other than sterling 52% euro, 51% yen, 12% US dollar and 2% others and 17% of net borrowings had been purchased forward in sterling in anticipation of sterling denominated shareholder returns via share purchases and dividends.
This allows debt to be serviced in proportion to anticipated cash flows and therefore provides a partial hedge against profit and loss account translation exposure, as interest costs will be denominated in foreign currencies.
Thirdly, certain overseas businesses have foreign currency denominated goodwill allocated whilst other assets do not, therefore making comparisons in the balance sheet difficult.
Goodwill and other intangible assets As described further in note 25, the Group has undertaken a number of transactions during the year, including the acquisition of Singlepoint, Project Telecom Plc and additional minority stakes in certain existing subsidiary undertakings.
Under US GAAP, these transactions have resulted in the Group assigning 395 million to goodwill and 1,578 million to other intangible assets, of which 996 million was assigned to mobile licences and 582 million to customer bases.
A corresponding deferred tax liability of 534 million was recognised.
With the exception of goodwill, all intangible assets acquired are deemed to be of finite life, with a weighted average amortisation period of 12 years, comprising mobile licences 18 years and customer bases 4 years.
Had the acquisitions of Singlepoint, Project Telecom Plc and the additional minority stake increases been consummated on 1 April of the year preceding the year of acquisition, the results of these acquired operations would not have had a significant impact on the Groups consolidated results of operations for each of the financial years presented.

The estimated future amortisation charge on finite-lived intangible assets for each of the next five years is set out in the following table.
The estimate is based on finite-lived intangible assets recognised at 31 March 2004 using foreign exchange rates on that date.
It is likely that future amortisation charges will vary from the figures below, as the estimate does not include the impact of any future investments, disposals, capital expenditures or fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.

Stock based compensation For the purposes of US GAAP reporting, the Group accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with APB 25.
The Group also adopts the disclosure only provisions of SFAS No.
The Company currently uses a number of share plans to grant options and share awards to its directors and employees described in Note 22.
148 establishes a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans and encourages the recognition of the compensation cost on this basis in the income statement.
Where the cost is not recognised on the basis of fair value, the pro forma effect of the valuation method on net loss must be disclosed.
The disclosure only provisions of SFAS No.
US GAAP information continued Had compensation cost been determined based upon the fair value of the share options and ADS options at grant date, the Groups net loss and loss per share would have been restated to the pro forma amounts indicated below in millions, except per share amounts : 2004 2003 2002 m m m Net loss as reported under US GAAP 8,127 9,055 16,688 Share-based employee compensation expense net of related tax effects, included in the determination of net income as reported 129 48 Share-based employee compensation expense, under fair value based method for all awards, net of related tax effects 107 65 81 Pro forma net loss 8,105 9,072 16,769 Loss per share Basic and diluted as reported under US GAAP 11.93 p 13.29 p 24.56 p Basic and diluted pro forma 11.90 p 13.31 p 24.67 p Pensions and other post retirement benefits As at 31 March 2004, the Group operated a number of pension plans for the benefit of its employees throughout the world, which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
A description of the major pension plans provided is given in note 32.
Analyses of the net pension cost, plan assets, obligations and funded status for the major defined benefit plans in the UK, Germany and Japan, prepared under US GAAP, are provided below.
The investment policy and strategy of the main scheme in the UK is set by the Trustees and reflects the liabilities of the plan.
As at 31 March 2004, 79% 2003: 79%: 2002: 90% of the assets are invested in equities and the remainder in bonds.
The investment policy and strategy of the German plans are set by the Investment Sub-Committee of the Contractual Trust Agreement and similarly reflects the liabilities of the plans, which are more heavily weighted towards pensioners than the UK plan.
70% of the assets are invested in bonds and the remainder in equities.
The basis used to determine the overall long term return on plan assets is to apply the expected rate of return on bonds based on market interest rates at the relevant date to that proportion of the assets invested in bonds.
The bond rate of return is then increased by an allowance for the expected equity risk premium in each market, based on past experience and future expectations of return and this rate is applied to the relevant proportion invested in equities.
The measurement date for the Groups pension assets and obligations is 31 March.
The measurement date for the Groups net periodic pension cost is 1 April.
The cash contributions for the UK plan for the year ending 31 March 2005 are currently estimated to be 36 million.

Changes in accounting standards UK standards UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts During the financial year, the UK Accounting Standards Board ASB issued UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts which supersedes UITF 13 and requires presentation of an entitys own shares held in an ESOP trust to be deducted in arriving at shareholders funds as opposed to being recognised as assets.
The Group has early adopted this Abstract in the preparation of its Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2004, and has restated its balance sheets at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 accordingly.
The impact of adopting UITF 38 was to reduce investments and shareholders funds by 41 million as at 31 March 2003.
In addition, the cash outflow on purchasing own shares in relation to employee share schemes has been reclassified from Purchase of investments within Net cash outflow for capital expenditure and financial investment to its own line within financing activities in the Statement of Consolidated Cash Flows.
Loss on ordinary activities before taxation in the 2002, 2003 and 2004 financial years has not been impacted by the adoption of UITF 38, however, the reported value of fixed asset investments, net assets and equity shareholders funds would be 48 million higher at 31 March 2004 had the Group not adopted UITF 38.
Application Note G to FRS 5, Reporting the Substance of Transactions In November 2003, the ASB issued this application note setting out principles of revenue recognition.
It specifically addresses five types of arrangement, which give rise to turnover and have been subject to differing interpretations in practice.
Following the issuance of the Application Note, the Group has amended its accounting policy on revenue recognition in relation to the deferral of certain equipment, connection, upgrade and tariff migration fees.
The effect of the revised policy on the Groups turnover is not material in either the current or previous financial years.
FRS 20 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment In April 2004, the ASB issued FRS 20 IFRS 2 Share-based Payment, which is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
Current UK GAAP requires that a charge for employee share schemes should be made based on the intrinsic value at grant date and as such no expense is recognised for a number of share based payment transactions, such as the grant of share options to employees at market value.
The new standard requires the Vodafone Group Plc Annual Report 2004 126 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 37.
Changes in accounting standards continued Group to recognise a charge for certain share-based transactions granted after 7 November 2002, equal to the fair value of the share or share option at the date of the grant over the vesting period.
FRS 21 IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date In May 2004, the ASB issued FRS 21 IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, which is applicable for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The adoption of this standard will result in equity dividends, which are currently declared after the balance sheet date but recognised in the Consolidated Financial Statements at the balance sheet date, being derecognised at the balance sheet date.
This would reduce the Groups retained loss under UK GAAP for the 2002, 2003 and 2004 financial years by 47 million, 101 million and 116 million, respectively, and increase the Groups net assets and equity shareholders funds under UK GAAP at 31 March 2004 by 728 million 2003: 612 million.
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No.
143 is effective for financial years beginning after 15 June 2002 and requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
The associated asset retirement costs are capitalised as part of the carrying amount of the long-lived asset.
The Group adopted this statement effective 1 April 2003.
The Group is subject to asset retirement obligations in relation to certain operating lease agreements relating to sites on which the Groups network infrastructure is positioned.
These leases can include legal obligations to restore the leased site at the end of the lease term.
Based on the Groups historical experience it is expected that a high majority of current sites will continue to be of importance to the network and that, where possible, the Group will continue to renew leases on these sites.
143 did not have a material impact on the Groups reported financial position and results under US GAAP.
150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
150 on 1 April 2004 resulted in the Groups class D & E preferred shares issued by Vodafone Americas, Inc. with a carrying value of 875 million, currently classified as non-equity minority interests, being classified as long term liabilities.
The measurement provisions of SFAS No.
150 related to these preferred shares have, however, been indefinitely deferred.
Applying the measurement provisions of SFAS No.
150 would increase the carrying value as of 1 April 2004 by 23 million.
132R, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No.
132R revised 2003, to improve financial statement disclosures for defined benefit plans.
This standard requires that companies provide more details about their plan assets, benefit obligations, cash flows, benefit costs and other relevant information.
The provisions of SFAS 132R are effective for periods ending after 15 December 2003 and have been adopted for domestic plans.
However, certain provisions related to non-UK defined benefit plans are not effective until periods ended after 15 June 2004.
46 revised December 2003 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46.
FIN 46 expands upon existing US accounting guidance that prescribes when an entity should consolidate the assets, liabilities and results of a variable interest entity VIE.
A VIE is an entity whose equity is not sufficient to supports its activities without additional subordinated financial support or its equity investors lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest.
Under FIN 46 an enterprise shall consolidate a VIE if the enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses or receive the majority of the VIEs expected residual returns, or both.
In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised FIN 46 to modify some provisions and exempt certain entities.
Adoption of FIN 46 and its revision has not impacted the Groups reported financial position and results under US GAAP.
EITF 00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple element deliverables In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB reached a consensus on EITF 00-21.
EITF 00-21 provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that may involve multiple revenue-generating activities, for example, the delivery of products or performance of services, and or rights to use other assets.
The requirements of EITF 00-21 will be applicable to agreements entered into for periods beginning after 15 June 2003.
The prospective adoption of EITF 00-21 on 1 October 2003 has not impacted the Groups reported financial position and results under US GAAP.
However, as contracts entered into before 1 October 2003 are accounted for in accordance with SAB 101, the related deferred connection revenues, and related costs, will continue to be recognised over the remaining life of the customer relationship.
At 31 March 2004, deferred revenue accounted for in accordance with SAB 101 amounted to 3,737 million.
International Financial Reporting Standards Introduction The Group is preparing for the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as its primary accounting basis, following the adoption of Regulation No.
1606 2002 by the European Parliament on 19 July 2002.
IFRS will apply for the first time in the Groups Annual Report for the year ending 31 March 2006.
Annual Report 2004 Vodafone Group Plc 127 Subject to the finalisation of a proposed SEC rule on first time adoption of IFRS, it is currently expected that one year of IFRS comparative information for the year ending 31 March 2005 will be provided in the year of first adoption.
Interim results for the six-month period ending 30 September 2005 will be presented under IFRS together with restated information for the six months ending 30 September 2004.
The Group has established a project team to evaluate and monitor developments in IFRS and to manage and co-ordinate the implementation of IFRS across the Group.
Current principal differences between IFRS and UK GAAP On 31 March 2004, the International Accounting Standards Board IASB completed the set of standards that are mandatory for EU listed companies adopting IFRS for the first time.
Following the completion of this process, the Group has provisionally identified the major differences between IFRS and the Groups UK GAAP accounting policies, which are summarised below.
While the following disclosure is intended to highlight those differences expected to result in significant changes to the results and financial position reported under UK GAAP, this summary is not intended to be a complete list of differences between the two accounting bases applicable to the Group.
In addition, further significant differences may arise from accounting standards and pronouncements that the IASB could issue in the future and which the Group may elect to early adopt in the its first IFRS accounts.
As noted below, the Group is also still considering the impact of the IASBs recently issued standards on business combinations, intangible assets and impairment.
Finally, the Group is considering which, if any, of the optional transitional provisions within IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards to adopt which may impact substantially the Groups reported results.
Scope of Consolidation Under UK GAAP, the Group currently accounts for its 76.8% interest in Vodafone Italy as a subsidiary undertaking.
As a result of the significant participating rights held by the largest minority shareholder, it is currently anticipated that the adoption of IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, and IAS 28, Accounting for Investments in Associates, will result in Vodafone Italy being accounted for as an associated undertaking.
Financial Instruments Under UK GAAP, financial instruments are generally measured at cost with gains and losses being deferred until the underlying transaction occurs.
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement requires certain financial instruments to be measured at fair value and is expected to introduce certain additional volatility into the Groups profit and loss account.
The primary impact of the implementation of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, is anticipated to be the reclassification of the Groups non-equity minority interests to liabilities.
As discussed in Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Funding and liquidity, the Groups internal debt protection ratios define net debt to include redeemable preference shares and financial guarantees.
Share based payments UK GAAP requires that the charge for employee share schemes should be based on the intrinsic value at grant date.
As a result, no expense is recognised for a number of share based payment transactions such as the grant of share options to employees at market value.
IFRS 2, Share-based Payment, will require the Group to recognise an expense for certain share based transactions granted after 7 November 2002, equal to the fair value of the share or share option at the date of the grant over the vesting period.
Pensions and other retirement benefits For defined benefit pension schemes, the requirements of IAS 19, Employee Benefits, are similar to those of FRS 17 under UK GAAP, though IAS 19 permits the deferral of actuarial gains and losses in certain circumstances which is not permitted under FRS 17.
The IASB is currently considering revisions to IAS 19, which would substantially align the accounting for defined benefit schemes to the requirements of FRS 17.
The Group currently applies the provisions of SSAP 24.
Deferred taxes IAS 12, Income Taxes, requires accounting for deferred tax on temporary differences, which is wider in scope than existing UK GAAP accounting principles in relation to deferred taxation.
The Group is currently considering IAS 12 together with the tax accounting impact of a number of other recently introduced international accounting standards.
Other matters Business combinations and intangible assets IFRS 3: Business Combinations, IAS 36: Impairment of Assets and IAS 38: Intangible Assets were issued by the IASB on 31 March 2004.
These standards are of particular significance to the Group given both the nature of its operations and the nature and scale of the intangible assets currently recognised under UK GAAP.
While the Group is currently considering the impact of these standards, the most significant impact is likely to be the requirement for goodwill not to be amortised.
Revenue recognition The Group does not currently anticipate any significant difference between the Groups current UK GAAP revenue recognition policies and those required to be adopted to comply with IAS 18: Revenue.
