Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP dated January 2003.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
b Valuation of fixed asset investments UK listed investments are valued according to the prices issued by the London Stock Exchange, being the closing midmarket prices or last traded price for all investments where appropriate.
AIM investments are valued at closing midmarket prices.
Overseas listed investments are valued at their closing mid-market prices.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors at cost unless circumstances indicate that different valuations are warranted.
c Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the other capital reserves.
d Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are taken to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis.
Income from nonequity shares is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on the shares.
Income from fixed interest debt securities is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on each such security.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
e Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
In accordance with the boards expectation, over the long term, that investment returns will be attributable 70% to capital gains and 30% to income, the Company charges to capital 70% of the finance costs and management fee.
The performance fee earned for the year ended 30 June 2004 has been allocated between capital and revenue based on the outperformance attributable to capital and revenue respectively.
f Taxation The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between revenue and capital using the Companys effective rate of taxation for the year.
g Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
h Financial instruments Derivative instruments may be utilised by the Company.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the market risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Company.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption allowed under Financial Reporting Standard 13 and excluded short term debtors and creditors from disclosures under financial instruments where allowed see note 15 on pages 32 and 33.

The accounts of the three companies have not been consolidated because of the insignificant amounts involved.
Consequently the accounts present information about the Company as an individual entity and not about its Group.
The directors consider that the values of the subsidiary undertakings are not less than the amounts at which they are included in the accounts.
The dormant companies are maintained in order to protect the company names.
The City of London European Trust Limited was incorporated in 1899 as Patrick & McGregor, Limited and is dormant not having traded since 1968.
The aggregate amount of the capital and reserves of the City of London European Trust Limited at 30 June 2004 was 347,000 2003: 347,000.

31 Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Financial instruments a Management of risk The Companys financial instruments may comprise: Equity and non-equity shares and fixed interest securities that are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective as set out on the inside front cover: Debenture stocks, preference and preferred ordinary stocks, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations: and Cash, liquid resources and short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Companys operations.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the portfolio managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements.
It is the boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
Stock selection is a factor which acts to reduce market risk.
The Portfolio Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the board, which meets regularly to consider investment strategy.
Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through its debenture stocks, preference and preferred ordinary stocks and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Company borrows in sterling and euros at both fixed and floating rates of interest and the board imposes borrowing limits to ensure that gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise mainly readily realisable securities that can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
The maturities of the Companys existing borrowings are set out in paragraph c below.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of short-term borrowing and overdraft facilities.
Foreign currency risk A portion of the Companys portfolio is invested in overseas securities and their sterling value could be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company considers hedging against foreign currency movements affecting the value of the investment portfolio and takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
b Risk profile of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The majority of the Companys financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a stated maturity date.
Financial liabilities The interest rate profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 30 June 2004 was: Weighted Weighted Fixed rate average Fixed rate average financial Weighted period for financial Weighted period for liabilities average which interest liabilities average which interest 000 interest rate rate is fixed 000 interest rate rate is fixed 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 Debenture stocks 46,000 9.27% 15.6 years 46,000 9.27% 16.6 years Preference and preferred ordinary stocks without a redemption date 2,086 9.10% 2,086 9.10% ccc ccc 48,086 48,086 mmm mmm 32 Notes to the Accounts continued 15 Financial instruments continued c Maturity of the Companys financial liabilities All of the Companys redeemable financial liabilities at 30 June 2004 mature in more than five years.

The facilities are subject to regular review by the providers.
d Currency exposure The Company has investments of 14,347,000 2003: 9,753,000 and current assets of 46,000 2003: 42,000 denominated in currencies other than sterling: therefore the net assets and total return can be affected by currency movements.
All other financial assets and financial liabilities are denominated in sterling.
e Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All of the financial assets of the Company are held at fair value.
Set out below is a comparison of the book values and the fair values of the Companys financial liabilities at 30 June 2004: Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 2004 2004 2003 2003 000 000 000 000 Debenture stocks 46,000 57,609 46,000 60,925 Preference and preferred ordinary stocks 2,086 2,804 2,086 2,883 The fair values of the debenture stocks and the preference and preferred ordinary stocks have been determined by reference to the prices published in the London Stock Exchange Daily Official List.

An alternative net asset value per ordinary share can be calculated by deducting from the total assets less current liabilities of the Company the preference and preferred ordinary stocks and the debenture stocks at their market or fair values rather than at their par or book values.
Details of the alternative values are set out in note 15 e on page 33.
