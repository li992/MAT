Borrowings and financial instruments The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings and other items arising directly from its trading operations which include long and short-term debtors, and long and short-term land, trade and other creditors.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following analyses.
The Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are liquidity, currency and interest rate risks.
i Liquidity risk The profile of the Groups borrowing facilities is representative of the nature of its activities, being a combination of medium and long-term projects.
On 4th September 2003, in line with the Groups policy to extend the average maturity of its facilities, the Group issued $100.0m of unsecured fixed interest rate loan notes at an average fixed interest rate of 5.6%.
On issue, swap arrangements were entered into to fix the principal amount of the loan notes at 62.0m and to fix the sterling interest payments relative to this amount as detailed below.
At the year end 50% of the Groups borrowings were due to mature after more than five years.
The average maturity of the committed facilities was 3.2 years.
The Groups policy is to monitor current and forecast gearing levels with borrowings normally remaining within the level of the committed facilities.
ii Interest rate risks As at 31st December 2004, the Company had entered into swap arrangements matching sterling interest rate payments with the swapped sterling balance of 62.0m as follows: Fixed rate Fixed rate Amount payable Maturity Amount payable Maturity m % m % 21.7 5.625 4.9.
2015 56 Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 17.
Borrowings and financial instruments continued At 31st December 2004, 69% of the debt was at fixed rates.
The year end borrowings position was not typical due to the cyclical pattern of both housing and property development completion monies.
No interest is payable on long-term land creditors.
Bank borrowings are all unsecured with floating interest rates linked to money market rates: LIBOR, EBBR and base rate.
The floating rates are fixed in advance for periods generally ranging from one to three months.
Short-term flexibility is achieved through the use of overdraft and short-term committed and uncommitted bank facilities.
Floating rate financial assets are linked to UK base rate.
After taking into account swap arrangements, the interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities, which are all sterling balances, at 31st December was: Group Group 2004 2003 m m Floating rate financial assets 0.6 2.2 Fixed rate financial assets 0.2 Financial assets on which no interest is paid 0.2 0.3 Gross financial assets 1.0 2.5 Floating rate financial liabilities 63.6 81.4 Fixed rate financial liabilities 141.6 141.6 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid 23.2 24.6 Gross financial liabilities 228.4 247.6 Financial assets comprise cash at bank of 0.5m 2003: 2.1m and long-term trade debtors of 0.5m 2003: 0.4m.
The weighted average interest rate for the fixed rate financial liabilities was 6.5% for 2004 2003: 6.5%, with, at 31st December 2004, a weighted average period of 6.9 years 2003: 7.9 years for which the rate is fixed.
The weighted average period until maturity of the financial liabilities on which no interest is paid is 1.8 years 2003: 2.4 years.
iii Currency exposure After taking into account currency swaps the Group had no currency exposure at 31st December 2004 2003: Nil.
iv Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31st December was as follows: Group Group 2004 2003 m m In one year or less or on demand 33.6 33.8 In more than one year but not more than two years 17.5 15.9 In more than two years but not more than five years 75.6 56.3 In more than five years 101.7 141.6 228.4 247.6 Included within the above are the following amounts relating to bank and other loans and overdrafts: Group Group 2004 2003 m m Bank overdrafts 33.6 3.8 Bank loans repayable otherwise than by instalments Amounts falling due: In one year or less or on demand 30.0 In more than two years but not more than five years 70.0 47.6 In more than five years 102.0 142.0 Less issue costs 0.4 0.4 Bank and other loans and overdrafts note 16 205.2 223.0 Loans repayable otherwise than by instalments falling due in five years or more comprise 102.0m of unquoted fixed rate loan notes.
40.0m of these notes are repayable in October 2010, 43.4m in September 2013 and 18.6m in September 2015.
These notes carry interest at an average rate of 6.4% and are unsecured.

Borrowings and financial instruments continued v Borrowing facilities The Group currently has sterling bank and other borrowing facilities amounting to 760.0m.
Committed facilities amount to 697.0m, of which 410.0m are available under medium-term committed lines.
All bank facilities are subject to floating interest rates linked to money market rates.
The undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to the Group at 31st December, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, had the following spread of maturity: Group Group 2004 2003 m m Expiring in one year or less 80.0 32.5 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 200.0 105.0 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 245.0 177.4 525.0 314.9 vi Fair value of financial liabilities Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial liabilities: Group Group Group Group 2004 2004 2003 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term borrowings net of cash in hand 0.5m 2003: 2.1m 33.1 33.1 31.7 31.7 Medium-term borrowings 30.0 30.0 47.6 47.6 Long-term borrowings 141.6 139.0 141.6 143.1 Land creditors 23.2 21.1 24.6 24.6 Long-term debtors 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Swap arrangements 9.4 4.3 227.4 232.1 245.1 250.9 Market values have been used to determine the fair value of swap arrangements.
The fair values of long-term borrowings have been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
There is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the Groups other financial assets and liabilities.
vii Gains and losses on financial liabilities held for hedging purposes The Groups policy is to hedge a proportion of interest rate risk using swap arrangements.
Gains and losses on swap arrangements are recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which they crystallise.
