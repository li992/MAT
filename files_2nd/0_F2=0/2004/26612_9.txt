The Groups pension cost for the year amounted to 9.0 million 2003: 6.6 million and where appropriate is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
The latest actuarial valuation of the largest scheme, the Man Group plc Pension Fund formerly known as the E D & F Man Limited Group Pension Fund, a UK defined benefit pension plan, was made at 31 December 2002 using the market-related approach.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were price inflation 2.5% per annum, wage and salary increases 5.0% per annum and investment return 6.4% per annum.
Actuarial valuations are conducted every three years.
The results of the latest actuarial valuation of the Man Group plc Pension Fund give the market value of the assets of the scheme as 93.4 million.
The actuarial value of the assets of the scheme represented approximately 87% of the liabilities for the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The funding level on a Minimum Funding Requirement basis was 108%.
The Group has net pension prepayments amounting to 5.6 million 2003: 7.9 million, which are included in debtors, this being the excess of the actual contributions paid over the accumulated pension cost.
Other than pensions, the Group does not operate any other form of post-retirement benefit schemes.

Staff costs and employees continued ii FRS 17 disclosures The Group has implemented the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK scheme at 31 December 2002.
The UK scheme is a closed scheme and the current service cost is expected to increase as the members approach retirement.
For the UK scheme, the Group has agreed to contribute 23.1% of pensionable salaries each year until 2008 and in addition, to make a 1 million payment twice a year until 2013.
The valuations of both the UK and US schemes were updated by a qualified independent actuary at 31 March 2004 to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
In addition a new Swiss scheme, which has some of the characteristics of a defined benefit scheme, was introduced in July 2003.
The main financial assumptions used in the actuarial valuations were: Swiss UK scheme US scheme scheme 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 2004 % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Inflation 2.9 2.5 3.0 4.0 4.0 4.0 1.5 Rate of increase in salaries 5.5 5.0 5.5 5.0 5.0 5.0 5.0 The rate of increase for pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 3.0 The rate of increase for deferred pensions 5.0 5.0 5.0 The rate used to discount scheme liabilities 5.5 5.4 6.0 5.75 6.25 7.25 3.75 The value of the assets and liabilities of the schemes, the assumed long-term rates of return and the assets and liabilities were as follows: UK scheme UK scheme UK scheme 2004 2003 2002 Rate of Rate of Rate of return Value return Value return Value %m % m %m Equities 8.2 45.1 8.6 34.6 7.8 45.8 Bonds 5.2 24.4 5.0 23.1 5.8 25.4 Other 6.1 35.4 6.2 34.7 6.6 30.5 Fair value of scheme assets 104.9 92.4 101.7 Present value of scheme liabilities 136.1 131.6 106.0 Net deficit in scheme 31.2 39.2 4.3 US scheme US scheme US scheme 2004 2003 2002 Rate of Rate of Rate of return Value return Value return Value %m % m %m Equities 10.0 6.5 10.0 5.8 8.5 8.8 Bonds 8.0 2.0 8.0 4.0 8.5 4.3 Other 5.5 6.1 5.5 4.7 8.5 0.8 Fair value of scheme assets 14.6 14.5 13.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 15.4 15.5 14.7 Net deficit in scheme 0.8 1.0 0.8 Swiss scheme 2004 Rate of return Value %m Equities Bonds Other 4.0 8.2 Fair value of scheme assets 8.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 10.2 Net deficit in scheme 2.0 Man Group plc Annual Report 2004 59 Notes to the Accounts 8.

In Asset Management, goodwill arising on the acquisitions of RMF and Glenwood is being amortised evenly over the directors estimate of their useful economic lives of fifteen years.
In Brokerage, goodwill arising on the acquisition of GNI is being amortised evenly over the directors estimate of its useful economic life of ten years.
Goodwill is subject to impairment reviews at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition.
Therefore, at 31 March 2004, impairment reviews were performed on the goodwill arising on the RMF and GNI acquisitions.
The impairment reviews are based on discounted expected future cash flow models.
The discount rates used reflect estimates that the market would expect of an equally risky investment.
For RMF the discount rates applied to net management fee income and net performance fee income were 10% and 30% respectively.
The discount rate used in the GNI calculation was 10%.
As a result of the reviews, no impairment was identified.

Accordingly, the amount of loans to funds will vary from one period to the next as a consequence of the net effect of the level of sales in the period less the quantum of the external re-financing initiative in the period.
This external re-financing is typically in the form of total return swaps.
On these swaps the Group often enters into a committed purchase agreement and, in some instances, gives a first risk of loss guarantee to the external provider.
The probability of the Group incurring a loss as a result of giving these guarantees is remote as discussed in the Credit and counterparty risk section of the Financial Review.
b Other debtors falling due within one year includes 12.8 million in relation to loan notes in the management buyout group who purchased the Groups Agricultural Products businesses in March 2000.

Derivatives and other financial instruments A discussion of the Groups strategies and policies with regard to derivatives and other financial instruments is given in the Financial Review on page 26.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption available, under FRS 13, for short-term debtors and creditors which are included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet at amounts which are not significantly different from their fair values.
This means that these amounts are excluded from the following tables except for note 21 c. a Fair values and book values of financial instruments The comparison of fair and book values of all the Groups financial instruments is set out below.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
