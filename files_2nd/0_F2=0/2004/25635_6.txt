Note 2: Options granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP in 2003 are subject to a variety of performance conditions.
LTIPs awarded to executives of operating subsidiaries have performance conditions relating to the growth in trading profit and profit before tax over a three year period from the date of the award.
In general terms the annual average growth must exceed the regional RPI by a margin of at least 2%.
"LTIPs awarded to Executive Directors of the Group in 2003 have performance conditions based on the Company's earnings per share ""EPS""."
For 50% of each award, EPS growth is measured over three years.
Full vesting occurs if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by at least 10% and vesting only starts if average annual EPS growth exceeds inflation by 2%, with pro rata vesting between 2% and 10%.
If the minimum EPS growth hurdle has not been achieved over the 3 years there is discretion to extend the measurement periods for a further year.
The other 50% of the award vests depending on EPS growth using the same 2% - 10% range over a single year, although shares cannot normally be acquired until after 3 years.
However, if the condition was not satisfied in full, the remaining proportion of the award could vest depending on the performance over the remainder of the three year period.
For LTIPs awarded in 2004 to Executive Directors of the Group the performance conditions require growth in the Company's EPS over the single 3 year period from 2004 to 2006 as follows: Growth of EPS in excess of the RPI over 3 years Proportion of awards vesting RPI 3% per annum or less 0% Between RPI 3% and 10% per annum Pro rata between 0% and 100% RPI 10% per annum or more 100% Note 3: Certain other awards have been granted with specific performance targets defined for the individual executives.
In general these require targets for revenue and profit growth to be met over the vesting period.
Under the Black-Scholes model if the dividend yield is assumed to be zero then the fair value will equal the share price at date of grant.
The volatility has been calculated based on the historical share price of the Company, using either a 3 or 5 year term.
All options granted under the share option schemes are conditional upon the employees remaining in the Group's employment during the vesting period of the option, the actual period varies according to the scheme in which the employee participates.
In calculating the cost of options granted, a factor is included to take account of anticipated lapse rates.
