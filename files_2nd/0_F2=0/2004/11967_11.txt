In preparing the accounts, the directors are required to select appropriate accounting policies and then apply them consistently, make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent and state whether all accounting standards which they consider to be applicable have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The directors are also required to use a going concern basis in preparing the accounts unless this is inappropriate.
The directors have responsibility for ensuring that the Company keeps accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and which enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
The directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
