40 ITV plc Annual report 04 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting ITV plc formerly 2232nd Single Member Shelf Investment Company Limited was incorporated on 18 November 2003, re-registered as a public limited company on 3 December 2003 and has not previously prepared audited financial statements.
Accordingly these accounts are the Companys first consolidated financial statements.
They have been prepared by adopting group reconstruction principles to account for the acquisition of Granada plc by ITV plc as if ITV plc had always been the parent company of the Granada Group, and acquisition accounting principles to account for the acquisition of Carlton Communications Plc by ITV plc.
This combination took place on 2 February 2004.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year to 31 December 2004 comprise the results of the Company itself from incorporation to 31 December 2004 there were no material costs or revenues prior to 31 December 2003 and the results of the remainder of the Group for the year to 31 December 2004.
The comparative information of the Group comprises the results of Granada plc.
The Group has adopted UITF 17 Revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes for the first time in these accounts.
Previously share awards were charged through the profit and loss account based on the cost of shares purchased, now the charge is based on the market value at the date of the award.
The impact on the 2003 comparatives is to increase the profit and loss account charge by 6 million and to increase the accrual held within reserves under UITF 38 see below by 6 million.
The impact on the 2004 results has not been disclosed as following the change in accounting policy and the combination of Granada and Carlton, the underlying records have been integrated and it is not practicable to quantify the impact on 2004.
The Group has adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts for the first time in these accounts.
Previously the cost of the investment in own shares net of the accrual for share awards made was shown within investments in the balance sheet.
Under UITF 38 these are now shown within reserves.
The net impact on reserves after the impact of UITF 17 revised 2003 shown above is a decrease of 25 million with the same reduction in investments.
This standard has no profit and loss account impact.
As explained above the impact on 2004 has not been disclosed.
Following the combination of Granada and Carlton the accounting policy relating to international distribution was harmonised.
In Granada, revenue was recognised following contractual agreement and delivery.
Under the revised policy revenue is not recognised until, additionally, the licence period has started.
The comparatives have been adjusted to reect this change in accounting policy for Granada.
The impact on the 2003 comparatives is a reduction in turnover of 6 million, a reduction in operating costs of 3 million, an increase in creditors of 4 million and a reduction in reserves of 4 million.
As the underlying records have been integrated, it is not practicable to quantify the impact on 2004.
As permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account, dealing with the results of the parent company only, has not been presented.
There are no discontinued operations for the 12 months ended 31 December 2004.
Discontinued operations in the 15 months ended 31 December 2003 represent the results of Boxclever, Granada Business Technology and other discontinued joint ventures.
The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of certain assets and in accordance with applicable accounting standards except in respect of certain items previously noted in prior years.
These arose in 2000 and 2001 as a consequence of the merger and demerger with Compass Group PLC, including the disposal of the Hospitality businesses.
These items are explained in note 30 to the accounts in respect of the accounting for the re-acquisition of the publicly held minority in Granada Media plc and in note 6 to the accounts in respect of the accounting for pension costs.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts incorporate the accounts of ITV plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of businesses acquired during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition.
The results of businesses sold during the year are included up to the date on which control is relinquished with the exception of those businesses accounted for as held for sale following the acquisition accounting for Carlton which are not consolidated.
On 1 February 2001 Granada plc issued shares to the 20% minority interest shareholders in Granada Media plc in exchange for that interest, in accordance with the terms of the original issue of the minorities shares.
As further described in note 30 to the accounts, this transaction was not dealt with as an acquisition under FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings but, in an override of that standard necessary in the opinion of the directors for the accounts to give a true and fair view, in a way that showed its net effect as equivalent to a share issue by Granada plc.
Associates and joint ventures Associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method and joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Loans to joint ventures are taken into account when calculating the Groups net interest in joint ventures.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest, usually from 20% to 50% of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant inuence.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
Turnover Turnover is stated exclusive of VAT and consists of sales of goods and services to third parties.
Key classes of revenue are recognised on the following basis: Advertising and sponsorship on transmission Programme production on delivery Programme rights when contracted and available for exploitation Foreign currencies Overseas trading results are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange ruling during the financial period.
Overseas net assets and UK loans denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at period end rates of exchange.
Exchange differences arising on the Groups net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings and on borrowings in foreign currency nancing those investments are dealt with through reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised over the period of the employees related performance in accordance with UITF 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes.
No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all or substantially all employees.
Film libraries Libraries acquired are valued at cost on acquisition and amortised using the sum of digits basis over 20 years which represents the time period in which these assets are expected to generate positive cash ows.
41 1 Accounting policies continued Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses a limited number of derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to uctuations in interest and other foreign exchange rates.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest rate swap and option agreements are used to manage the interest basis of borrowings.
Interest receipts and payments under these agreements are accrued so as to match the net income or cost with the related finance expense.
No amounts are recognised in respect of future periods.
The difference between the fair value and book value of bonds and derivative instruments arising on the acquisition of Carlton is amortised through net interest over the remaining life of the instruments.
Goodwill Goodwill on acquisitions arising since 30 September 1998 is capitalised.
In accordance with the transitional arrangements under FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions up to 30 September 1998 remains in reserves, where it was charged under the Groups previous accounting policy.
Analogue broadcasting goodwill is amortised over the period to 2010 which is the anticipated analogue switch-off date and production goodwill over 20 years.
Other goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis from the time of acquisition over its useful economic life of up to 20 years.
Where, in the opinion of the Board, the goodwill has an indefinite economic life, the presumption of a maximum life of 20 years is rebutted and the goodwill is not amortised.
This rebuttal would be made only where it was justied, in the opinion of the Board, by the durability of the acquired business.
The individual circumstances of each acquisition the Group makes are assessed to determine the appropriate treatment of any related goodwill.
Impairment reviews are carried out at the end of the first full year after acquisition.
Information in relation to reviews performed this year is shown in note 12.
Where goodwill is not amortised, this is a departure from the specic amortisation requirement of the Companies Act 1985 for the overriding purpose of giving a true and fair view of the Groups results for the reasons explained in note 12, which also shows the effects of this departure.
Depreciation Depreciation is provided to write-off the cost or valuation less estimated residual value of certain tangible xed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated future lives.
The major categories of xed assets are depreciated as follows: Vehicles, equipment and ttings 3 to 10 years Plant and machinery 10 to 15 years Properties: Television studios 50 years Leaseholds shorter of residual lease term or 50 years Freehold land not depreciated Freehold buildings up to 50 years Leases Finance leases are those which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
Assets held under such leases are capitalised as tangible xed assets and depreciation is provided where appropriate.
Outstanding finance lease obligations, which comprise principal plus accrued interest, are included within creditors.
The finance element of the agreements is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease on a systematic basis.
All other leases are operating leases the rentals on which are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Stocks Programme costs and rights are written off in full on first transmission except certain lm rights which are written off over a number of transmissions.
Films and programme costs not yet written off at the balance sheet date are included in stocks at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Contractual commitments in relation to acquired programming rights which are not yet available for transmission are included in the cost of programming rights in stocks.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised where material and computed without discounting.
Full provision is made in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items in the accounts and their treatment for taxation purposes at the balance sheet date, except as provided by FRS 19 Deferred Tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that the asset will be recovered.
Pension costs The expected cost of pensions in respect of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries and accounted for in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, except as explained in note 6.
Liquid resources These consist of current asset investments.
They include deposits which are restricted in use to meeting future finance lease commitments and GILTS held to meet unfunded pension commitments.
2 Turnover, profit before tax and net assets In the view of the directors, ITV plc has only one business segment which includes interests in broadcasting, production and other media activities.
Turnover and profit before tax are analysed by continuing and discontinued operations in the consolidated profit and loss account.

6 Pension schemes SSAP 24 The Group operates a number of funded dened benefit and dened contribution schemes.
The dened benefit schemes assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs for the dened benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with actuarial advice and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to recognise the cost over the working lifetime of the employees.
Actuarial valuations of these schemes are carried out by independent actuaries in accordance with local legislative requirements.
The accounting and funding policies differ to the extent that funding valuations may be based on more conservative assumptions and surpluses and deficits may be recognised more quickly for funding purposes.
Details of the assumptions and methods used, for accounting purposes, for the main schemes are given below: Last full actuarial valuation Principal expensing actuarial assumptions Average Valuation investment Average Average Market value Funding Contribution method rate of salary pension Spreading Pension fund Date of assets level rate adopted return increases increases method ITV1 October 2001 1,147m 100% 24% Projected Unit 5.5-6.0% 4.0% 2.25% Straight line Carlton Group 1 July 2001 106m 94% 10% Projected Unit 6.0% 4.0% 2.5-3.0% Level % pay Central 31 March 2002 248m 96% 27% Attained Age 5.7-6.7% 3.8% 3.63% Straight line HTV 1 August 2003 81m 79% 32% Attained Age 5.2-6.8% 4.0% 2.7% Level % pay The net charge for pensions and associated costs in the 12 months ended 31 December 2004 was 32 million 15 months ended 31 December 2003: 30 million.
Creditors falling due after more than one year include no amounts in respect of pensions 31 December 2003: nil.
In addition to the normal funding the Group made a further contribution of 10 million in 2004 to the ITV scheme and this extra funding will be kept under review.
significant changes to the Groups structure in 2000 had a material impact on the level of funding of the Groups pension scheme.
As a result the directors determined at that time that the pension fund prepayment should be written off in order for the accounts to show a true and fair view.
Under a normal application of SSAP 24, any difference between that prepayment and the surplus would have been recognised over the remaining service lives of the remaining employees in the scheme.
Had the prepayment not been written off, the pension charge for the 12 months ended 31 December 2004 would have been 40 million 15 months ended 31 December 2003: 40 million.
FRS 17 disclosures The Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 17 Retirement Benets on 30 November 2000.
Full implementation of the new standard has been delayed until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
Pension costs for the year have been accounted for under the existing accounting standard SSAP 24.
However, the Group has also made the disclosures required by the transitional arrangements governing the move to the new accounting standard, FRS 17.
The following gures exclude the Groups contributions to the dened contribution sections of the schemes.

This produces a volatile gure for any surplus or deficit as it is largely dependent on the levels of stock markets on one particular date.
The principal cause for the actuarial loss in the period is a change in the mortality rates used.
This reects an industry wide recognition that mortality rates have reduced.
ITV has used PA 92 tables with mortality projected to 2015 for pensioner members and to 2030 for non-pensioner members.
This is in line with the expected improvements in mortality, as per the most recent mortality investigation data published during the year, in conjunction with the results of an investigation into the mortality experience of scheme members.
The pension schemes are funded on a long term basis and therefore the FRS 17 disclosures are not relevant to the ongoing funding of the schemes.
The latest actuarial valuation of the schemes, including the funding level on an ongoing basis, is shown in the table at the start of this note which shows the percentage funding on an ongoing basis.

The share options in the 15 months ended 31 December 2003 are antidilutive because they reduce the loss per share.
Therefore diluted earnings per share for the 15 months ended 31 December 2003 are the same as basic earnings per share.

This is because of the durability and long term profitability of the broadcasting business and the strength of the underlying brand.
Therefore the directors consider it appropriate to depart from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and do not amortise digital goodwill in order to give a true and fair view.
If such goodwill had been amortised over a 20 year useful life in line with the rebuttable presumption in FRS 10 operating profit before exceptional items for the 12 months ended 31 December 2004 would have decreased by 135 million 15 months ended 31 December 2003: 62 million and capitalised goodwill at 31 December 2004 would have been 197 million 31 December 2003: 62 million lower than reported.
As required by FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets a formal impairment review was carried out at 31 December 2004 in relation to the digital goodwill.
No charge was considered necessary.
As a result of an impairment review on goodwill attached to the learning business an impairment of 4 million has been recognised within exceptional items.

21 Financial instruments Treasury operation and policy The most significant treasury exposures faced by ITV are raising finance, managing interest rate and currency positions and investing surplus cash in high quality assets.
Treasury policies have been approved by the Board for managing each of these exposures including levels of authority on the type and use of financial instruments.
Transactions are only undertaken if they relate to underlying exposures.
The treasury department reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board and treasury operations are subject to periodic independent reviews and internal audit.
Financing ITVs nancing policy for long term funding is to use debt instruments with a range of maturities.
It is substantially funded from the UK and European capital markets and has bank facilities from the UK syndicated market.
Interest rate management ITVs interest rate policy is to be between 30% and 70% xed on its forecast net indebtedness over the medium term in order to provide a balance between certainty of cost and benefit from low oating rates.
ITV uses interest rate swaps and options in order to achieve the desired mix between xed and oating.
Currency management ITVs foreign exchange policy is to hedge foreign currency denominated costs at the time of commitment and to hedge a proportion of foreign currency denominated revenues on a rolling 12 month basis.
It is also the Groups policy to hedge major balance sheet exposures.
The policies signicantly reduce the Groups earnings and balance sheet exposures to changes in exchange rates.
Investment in cash ITV operates strict investment guidelines with respect to surplus cash and the emphasis is on preservation of capital.
Counterparty limits for cash deposits are largely based upon long term ratings published by the major credit rating agencies.
Deposits longer than three months require the approval of the Management Committee of the Board.
The disclosures set out below exclude trading related short term debtors and creditors as permitted under FRS 13 Non-interest Derivatives and other Financial Instruments, other than as set out in the currency risk disclosure below.
a Interest rate risk prole Theinterest rate and currency prole of financial instruments at the period end are as follows: Financial assets 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 Non-interest Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total m m m m m m m m Currency Sterling 435 106 89 630 99 72 160 331 Euro 32 32 22 US dollar 77 33 Other 2 59 61 99 476 106 148 730 113 72 160 345 Fixed rate financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of 5.4% 31 December 2003: 5.3% and have a weighted average term of 14 years 31 December 2003: 11 years.
The cash and short term deposits, where interest bearing, attract interest at oating rates based on LIBID for periods of up to one month.
The non-interest bearing financial assets principally comprise investments and the Group has made no decision to dispose of them.
Financial liabilities 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 Non-interest Non-interest Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total m m m m m m m m Currency Sterling debt 607 289 59 955 5517 72 Other debt 11 66 Preference shares 88 607 297 60 964 5523 78 54 ITV plc Annual report 04 Notes to the accounts 21 Financial instruments continued Sterling xed rate liabilities Sterling xed rate liabilities comprise Carlton Communications Limited Preference Shares see note 21b, the 200 million Eurobond note 20 and finance lease creditors note 20.
The liabilities have a weighted average interest rate of 7.6% after taking account of interest rate swaps 31 December 2003: 5.0% and have a weighted average term of six years 31 December 2003: nine years.
Sterling oating rate liabilities Interest rate swaps matched against the 200 million Eurobond are described below: In April 2003 the 200 million Eurobond was swapped such that the Group receives the bond coupon of 7.625% and pays six month sterling LIBOR plus 3.19%.
The bank has the option to cancel the swap for nil value at each six monthly rate xing date.
In May 2004 the Group entered into a one year swap for 75 million, a two year swap for 75 million and a three year swap for 50 million under which it receives six month sterling LIBOR plus 3.19% and pays xed rates of 8.41%, 8.65% and 8.68% respectively.
The Group also has a further swap matched against this Eurobond which was dormant as at 31 December 2004.
Under the terms of this dormant swap if six month dollar LIBOR exceeds 3.75% the Group receives the bond coupon of 7.625% and pays the higher of six month dollar LIBOR plus 0.75% set in arrears or in advance payable in sterling or six month sterling LIBOR minus 0.1% set in arrears or in advance.
If six month dollar LIBOR set in advance sets above 6.5% a further 1% margin for that period is payable.
This swap is not designated as a hedge for accounting purposes and as such the Groups policy is to provide to the extent that the swap represents an onerous contract.
As at 31 December 2004 there was no provision against this swap.
Sterling oating rate cost of borrowing mainly comprises the post swap costs of various debt instruments described below: The Z639 million Exchangeable bond was swapped with effect from May 2002 from its xed rate cost of 2.25% into a oating rate cost of one month sterling LIBOR minus 2.81% on a notional amount of 395 million until January 2005.
In September 2004 the Group repurchased Z158 million of the Exchangeable.
In December 2004 1125 million of the bonds were put for settlement in January 2005.
At this time the Group entered into a forward starting two year swap commencing January 2005 whereby it receives 2.25% annually matched to the remaining Z356 million bonds and pays three month sterling LIBOR minus 0.23% on a notional 252 million.
The 250 million Eurobond was swapped in July 2003 with subsequent amendments in May 2004 and December 2004 from its xed rate coupon of 5.625% into the higher of six month sterling LIBOR set in arrears plus 1.045% or the payment rate used in the previous six month period.
Under the terms of this dormant swap if six month dollar LIBOR exceeds 3.75% the Group receives the bond coupon of 5.625% and pays the higher of six month dollar LIBOR plus 0.75% set in arrears or in advance payable in sterling or six month sterling LIBOR minus 0.1% set in arrears or in advance.
Yen 2 billion of private placement notes were swapped in September 2001 into sterling LIBOR plus 0.48% on a notional amount of 11 million.
6 million of loan notes were issued in consideration for repurchasing Carlton Communications Limited Preference Shares which pay a coupon of LIBOR minus 0.5%.
b Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The estimated fair value of the Groups financial instruments is set out below: 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2004 2004 2003 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial assets Fixed asset investments 140 152 157 183 Cash and other liquid funds 582 582 185 185 Debtors due after more than one year 88 33 730 742 345 371 Financial liabilities Loans 896 908 58 58 Preference shares 8 8 Creditors due after more than one year 60 60 20 17 964 976 78 75 Derivatives Interest rate swaps and options, and foreign exchange contracts 910 4 6 Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are detailed in note 14.
Joint ventures and associated undertakings have been excluded as required under FRS 13.
The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.
Cash and other liquid funds The carrying value approximates to fair value because of the short maturity of the instruments.
Debtors and creditors due after more than one year The fair value is based on estimates of likely cash receipts and payments.
Loans The 200 million and 250 million Eurobonds have book values of 208 million and 249 million respectively based upon their mid market valuations at merger and straight line amortisation to par over their remaining lives.
The fair value of these bonds discounting at LIBOR was 212 million and 257 million respectively.
Similarly the book value of the Yen 2 billion loan note was 11 million at 31 December 2004 which compares to its fair value calculated by discounting at LIBOR of 10 million.
The book value and the fair value of the Exchangeable bonds at 31 December 2004 was par on the basis that the holders of these bonds did not exercise their put option in December 2004.
The fair value of all other loans and finance leases were the same as book value at 31 December 2004.
Preference shares The fair value of the Carlton Communications Limited Preference Shares was not materially different from the book value at 31 December 2004 due to the proximity of the issuers call option on 30 April 2005.
55 21 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps and options The interest rate swaps and options that were held by Carlton Communications Limited at merger and which were still outstanding at 31 December 2004 have an aggregate book value provision of 24 million based upon their mid market valuations at merger and straight line amortisation over their remaining lives.
The fair value of these contracts along with new contracts entered into post merger on the basis of termination cost totalled 22 million at 31 December 2004.
Foreign exchange contracts Foreign exchange contracts are valued at the 31 December 2004 spot rate of exchange to match the treatment applied to the item hedged.
c Gains losses on hedging contracts The table below details gains losses on hedging contracts at 31 December 2004: Deferred Unrecognised Gains Losses Net Gains Losses Net m m m m m m Gains losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 2 2 Gains losses provided for on combination 3 38 35 Losses gains arising in previous years that were recognised in 2004 3 14 11 1 1 Losses gains arising in 2004 that were not recognised in 2004 6 3 3 Losses gains on hedges at 31 December 2004 24 24 6 4 2 Of which: Losses gains expected to be recognised in 2005 6 6 2 2 Losses gains expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 18 18 4 2 2 d Currency risk It is ITVs policy to hedge trading activities in non-functional currencies into the functional currency at the time of commitment.
After taking such hedges into account, ITV had no material financial exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses on monetary assets and monetary liabilities in non-functional currencies at 31 December 2004.

This results in a 5 million difference between Granada plcs closing profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2003 and the opening profit and loss reserve in these accounts arising from the difference between the 25 million dividend declared to be paid by Granada plc to ITV plc in respect of the three months to 31 December 2003 and the 20 million paid by ITV plc to shareholders in respect of the same period.
Of the prior period adjustments, 25 million is a balance sheet reclassication as a result of the implementation of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOPTrusts.
The remaining 10 million would have impacted prior periods retained profits so is reected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Of this amount 6 million is as a result of the implementation of UITF 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes, while 4 million relates to a harmonisation of accounting policies between Carlton and Granada for international distribution.
In accordance with UITF 38, included within the profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2004 is a 39 million 31 December 2003: 46 million deduction for investments held in ITV plc shares.
The cumulative amount of goodwill written off to reserves resulting from acquisitions made in earlier financial years, net of any goodwill attributable to subsidiary undertakings or businesses subsequently disposed of, is 1,248 million 31 December 2003: 1,248 million.
Were these businesses to be disposed of this goodwill would be taken to the profit and loss account to form part of the profit on disposal.

These were previously held within xed asset investments as joint ventures and associates.
The most material acquisition accounted for in the period results from the acquisition accounting of the combination with Carlton Communications Plc on 2 February 2004.
Consideration comprised 1,308 million ordinary shares and 124 million convertible shares in ITV plc.
The fair value of this consideration at the date of merger was 1,899 million.
The last audited accounts of Carlton prior to the merger was for the 15 months ended 31 December 2003.
The loss after tax and minority interests disclosed in these accounts was 239 million.
The unaudited summarised profit and loss account for Carlton from 1 January 2004 to the date of merger shows turnover, operating loss, loss before tax and taxation of 55 million, 3 million, 2 million and nil respectively.

The principal fair value adjustments were: Intangible xed assets: revaluation and accounting policy alignment of acquired ITC and Rank lm and programme libraries to value at amortised replacement costs.
Tangible xed assets: acquired properties stated at market value.
Investments: revaluation of xed asset investments to estimated market value.
Stocks: written down to net realisable value and alignment with ITVs accounting policy.
Assets held for resale: expected net sale proceeds of certain assets held for sale discounted to their present value at date of acquisition.
Creditors: revaluation of financial instruments to market value and provisions for properties.
Pensions: inclusion of pension deficits on acquisition as calculated in accordance with SSAP 24.
Taxation: deferred taxation provided on acquisition accounting adjustments as appropriate.
The adjustments made to reect the fair values of the GMTV and GSkyB acquisitions in 2004 were as follows: Book value Other Fair value before acquisition Revaluations adjustments to ITV plc m m m m Fixed assets 33 Stocks 7 6 1 Debtors 14 3 2 13 Cash 19 19 Creditors 29 3 32 Total net assets liabilities 14 12 2 4 Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, GSkyB, ITV2, LNN, ITFC and ITV News Channel were accounted for as associated undertakings and GMTV was accounted for as a joint venture.
In accordance with FRS 2, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of shares, being the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the Companies Act requirement to use the statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date the Company became a subsidiary undertaking.
The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Groups share of the Companys retained reserves during the period that it was an associated undertaking or joint venture being recharacterised as goodwill.
If the statutory method had been adopted an additional 70 million of goodwill would have been recognised with a corresponding increase in reserves.
The subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year contributed 103 million to the Groups net operating cash ows, received 3 million from equity accounted investments, paid 29 million in respect of returns on investment and servicing of finance, paid 11 million taxation, received 194 million from capital expenditure and financial investment and paid 189 million in respect of nancing.
In the 15 months ended 31 December 2003 there were no acquisitions.
During the period the Group disposed of The Moving Picture Company Holdings Ltd and Carlton Books Ltd which were classied as assets held for resale for respective gross considerations of 59 million and nil.
In the 15 months ended 31 December 2003 the interactive operations of Granada Business Technology Ltd were disposed of for 12 million.
The net assets associated with this disposal were 12 million.
60 ITV plc Annual report 04 Notes to the accounts 26 Contingent liabilities Under a Group registration, the Company is jointly and severally liable for VAT at 31 December 2004 of 49 million 31 December 2003: 18 million.
The Company has guaranteed certain finance and operating lease obligations of subsidiary undertakings.
There are contingent liabilities in respect of certain litigation and guarantees and in respect of warranties given in connection with certain disposals of businesses and in respect of certain trading and other obligations of certain subsidiaries.
In the opinion of the directors, adequate allowance has been made in respect of these matters.
27 Operating lease commitments At 31 December 2004 the Groups operating lease commitments for the year to 31 December 2005 are 17 million for the year to 31 December 2004: 11 million, analysed by expiry date as follows: 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 Other Other Land and operating Land and operating buildings leases Total buildings leases Total m m m m m m Within one year 11 11 Between two and five years 415 314 More than five years 11 11 66 16 1 17 10 1 11 28 Capital and other commitments There are no capital commitments at 31 December 2004 31 December 2003: none.
There are commitments in respect of forward foreign exchange contracts entered into in the ordinary course of business.
ITV has entered into a contract with Arsenal Holdings plc Arsenal under which ITV has agreed to acquire, for 30 million, 4.99% of the enlarged ordinary share capital of Arsenal together with certain commercial rights.
An accrual of 25 million is carried within creditors less than one year to reect the shortfall against market value.
29 Post balance sheet events 1125 million of the Exchangable bond was repaid in January 2005.
30 Accounting for mandatory exchange transaction in 2001 On 1 February 2001 Granada plc issued shares to the 20% minority interest shareholders in Granada Media plc in exchange for that interest.
Under the terms of the original issue of Granada Media shares to the minority, this transaction was required by the Articles of Granada Media plc once the demerger of the Groups Hospitality business, as Compass, took place.
Under FRS 2, Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings, in the event of an increase in a Groups interest in a subsidiary, the identiable assets and liabilities of the subsidiary should be revalued to fair value and goodwill arising on the increase should be calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration given the shares in Granada plc and the relevant proportion of the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary Granada Media plc.
In the opinion of the directors such a treatment would fail to give a true and fair view, as the substance of the transaction was not an acquisition of the minority interest, but a reorganisation of the interests in the underlying businesses of the Group such that all external shareholdings were held through Granada plc: no shareholders interest in the Group has been affected by the exchange and accordingly it would be inappropriate to record goodwill on the transaction or to show its net effect as ultimately being other than equivalent to a share issue by Granada plc.
Instead, the overall effect of the approach taken to accounting for these transactions was that the difference between the proceeds of original issue of the minority shares and the book value of the net assets attributable to the minority at 1 February 2001 was included as a gain in shareholders funds.
The effect of the departure from standard accounting practice on the Groups results for the periods ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 and its balance sheets at those dates cannot reasonably be quantied, and the directors believe that it is of no relevance to shareholders in the circumstances described above.
The fair value of the consideration given, based on the closing share price of Granada plc on 31 January 2001, amounted to 1,154 million which, under FRS 2, would have been allocated between the fair values of the share of separable net assets and of goodwill acquired.
In the opinion of the directors the expense and delay required to evaluate the fair values of the assets and liabilities of Granada Media plc at exchange was completely out of proportion to any value that shareholders might have derived from the information.
