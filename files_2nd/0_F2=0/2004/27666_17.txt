3 EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated based upon the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders.
The directors view is that adjusted operating earnings per share, derived from adjusted operating profit or loss after tax and minority interests, provides a better indication of the underlying performance of the Group.
For life assurance and general insurance businesses, adjusted operating profit is based on a long term investment return and includes investment return on own shares held in policyholders funds.
For banking business, adjusted operating profit excludes the loss on disposal of investment in Dimension Data Holdings plc, restructuring and integration costs and the transitional impact of the change in credit provisioning methodology.
For all businesses, adjusted operating profit excludes goodwill amortisation and impairment, and fines and penalties.
Adjusted operating earnings per share is similarly based, but is stated after tax and minority interests, with the calculation of the weighted average number of shares including own shares held in policyholders funds.
A table reconciling operating profit on ordinary activities after tax and minority interests to adjusted operating profit after tax and minority interests is set out below: m Rm Year to Year to Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December Notes 2004 2003 2004 2003 Profit on ordinary activities after tax and minority interests 484 273 5,704 3,381 Goodwill amortisation and impairment net of minority interests 83 128 971 1,581 Loss on disposal of investment in Dimension Data Holdings plc net of tax and minority interests 3 30 Restructuring and integration costs net of tax and minority interests 5 d ii 8 13 92 160 Change in credit provisioning methodology net of tax and minority interests 5 d iii 31 376 Fines and penalties net of tax 11 41 499 Short term fluctuations in investment returns net of tax and minority interests 162 95 1,907 1,170 Investment return adjustment for own shares held in policyholders funds 5 b iv 94 12 1,115 148 Non-operating items net of tax and minority interests 17 b 26 32 312 404 Adjusted operating profit after tax and minority interests 574 373 6,786 4,614 Notes to the Financial Statements | 73 3 EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE continued p c Year to Year to Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 2004 2003 Basic earnings per share after tax and minority interests 14.1 8.0 166.2 99.1 Impact of inclusion of own shares held in policyholders funds in weighted average number of shares 1.2 0.7 14.0 8.4 12.9 7.3 152.2 90.7 Goodwill amortisation and impairment net of minority interests 2.2 3.4 26.0 42.4 Loss on disposal of investment in Dimension Data Holdings plc net of tax and minority interests 0.1 0.8 Restructuring and integration costs net of tax and minority interests 0.2 0.3 2.5 4.3 Change in credit provisioning methodology net of tax and minority interests 0.8 10.1 Fines and penalties net of tax 1.1 13.3 Short term fluctuations in investment return net of tax and minority interests 4.3 2.5 50.9 31.3 Investment return adjustment for own shares held in policyholders funds 2.5 0.3 29.7 4.0 Non-operating items net of tax and minority interests 0.7 0.9 8.3 10.8 Adjusted operating earnings per share after tax and minority interests 15.3 10.0 181.1 123.8 Basic earnings per share is calculated by reference to the profit on ordinary activities after tax and minority interests of 484 million R5,704 million for the year ended 31 December 2004 2003: 273 million R3,381 million and a weighted average number of shares in issue of 3,432 million 2003: 3,411 million.

The dividend will be paid on 31 May 2005 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 22 April 2005, being the record date for the dividend.
As a consequence of the exchange control arrangements in place in South Africa and other relevant African territories, dividends to shareholders on the branch registers in those countries or in the case of Namibia, the Namibian section of the principal register are settled through dividend access trusts established for that purpose.
The dividend payable by the Company represents only the proportion of the Group dividend payable to shareholders on the principal register other than its Namibian section and is calculated based on the directors estimate of the number of shares that will be on that register on the record date for the dividend.
Indicative only the actual amount of the dividend per share in Rand will be determined by reference to the exchange rate prevailing on 31 March 2005 and announced by the Company on 1 April 2005.

The revised methodology requiring the discounting of future cash flows on advances is acceptable under UK GAAP reporting and was therefore adopted in preparation of the Groups financial statements, resulting in a one-off increase in opening specific provisions due to the discounting effect.
This adjustment has been taken to the profit and loss account in the Groups financial statements, but excluded from adjusted operating profit.

For the South African and Namibian long term business, the return is applied to an average value of investible shareholders assets.
For general insurance business, the return is an average value of investible assets supporting shareholders funds and insurance liabilities.
For the US long term business, the return earned by assets, mainly bonds, has been smoothed with reference to the actual yield earned by the portfolio.
Short term fluctuations in investment return represent the difference between actual return and long term investment return.
The long term rates of investment return for equities and other investible assets are as follows: Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 South Africa and Namibian long term and general insurance businesses weighted average return 12.5% 13.0% Equities 14.0% 14.0% Cash and other investible assets Rand denominated 11.0% 12.5% Cash and other investible assets other currencies 8.0% 9.0% United States 6.00% 6.04% The long term rates of return are based on achieved real rates of return adjusted for current inflation expectations and consensus economic investment forecasts, and are reviewed annually for appropriateness.
The directors are of the opinion that these rates of return are appropriate and have been selected with a view to ensuring that returns credited to operating earnings are not inconsistent with the actual returns expected to be earned over the long term.

90 | Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued 11 FINES AND PENALTIES On 21 June 2004, one of the Groups US asset management affiliates, Liberty Ridge Capital Inc. formerly known as Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd PBA, reached agreements with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the office of the New York State Attorney General NYAG which settle all charges brought by these authorities against PBA in relation to market timing in the US Mutual Fund business.
PBA agreed to pay US$40 million in disgorgement of past fees, as well as US$50 million in civil penalties.
This has resulted in a charge of 49 million R596 million for the year, which has been taken to the profit and loss account in the Groups financial statements, but excluded from adjusted operating profit.
Tax deductions have been recognised on the disgorgement of past fees, resulting in a tax credit of 8 million R97 million.
In addition PBA will reduce fees to investors by approximately US$10 million over the next five years.
There are several related private lawsuits arising from the conduct alleged in the civil suits filed by the SEC and NYAG.
These class action lawsuits were consolidated into a single lawsuit along with all other cases against US parties alleging market timing and late trading violations.
Proceedings in this case are at a preliminary stage and it is not possible to say, at this time, whether or not the amount of the ultimate liability to be borne by the Group will be material.
As a result, no amount has been recognised for additional fines or other penalties that may arise, as significant uncertainty remains over the quantum of any settlement.

These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs and contributions relating to defined benefit schemes are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Actuarial advice confirms that the current level of contributions payable to each pension scheme, together with existing assets, are adequate to secure members benefits over the remaining service lives of participating employees.
The schemes are reviewed at least on a triennial basis or in accordance with local practice and regulations.
In the intervening years, the actuary reviews the continuing appropriateness of the assumptions applied.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups pension schemes vary according to the economic conditions of the countries in which they operate.
The last full actuarial valuations were performed for the various schemes between 30 June 2002 and 31 December 2004 and, in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17, have been updated by either internal or external actuaries at 31 December 2004.
The major assumptions used in these valuations were: At 31 December 2004 At 31 December 2003 At 31 December 2002 South South South African UK African UK African UK schemes schemes schemes schemes schemes schemes Inflation assumption 4.0% 2.753.0% 5.0% 2.02.5% 6.5% 1.82.5% Rate of increase in salaries 5.5% 5.04.75% 6.5% 4.04.5% 7.58.0% 3.54.5% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 4.0% 2.73.0% 4.8% 2.03.0% 11.0% 1.83.1% Discount rate 8.5% 2.252.3% 9.5% 5.35.5% 11.011.5% 5.56.5% The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of and expected return on the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Expected long term rate of return m Rm South African UK Value of Value of schemes schemes assets assets At 31 December 2004 Equities 11.5% 7.5 8.3% 129 1,399 Bonds 8.5% 4.55.3% 91 987 Insurance policies and annuities 6.5% 5.3% 150 1,627 Cash 9.5% 4.754.8% 12 130 Total market value of assets 382 4,143 Present value of liabilities 364 3,949 Net pension surplus 18 194 Associated deferred tax asset 1 16 Net pension surplus after deferred tax 17 178 92 | Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued 14 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued Expected long term rate of return m Rm South African UK Value of Value of 14 a Employee pension plans continued schemes schemes assets assets At 31 December 2003 Equities 12.5% 7.5% 103 1,229 Bonds 9.5% 4.85.5% 67 797 Insurance policies and annuities 9.5% 4.85.3% 155 1,850 Cash 7.5% 3.84.8% 4 48 Total market value of assets 329 3,924 Present value of liabilities 324 3,867 Net pension surplus 5 57 At 31 December 2002 Equities 12.014.0% 7.5% 103 1,423 Bonds 9.012.0% 4.55.5% 50 691 Insurance policies and annuities 12% 4.57.5% 123 1,699 Cash 10% 3.54.5% 20 276 Total market value of assets 296 4,089 Present value of liabilities 299 4,130 Net pension deficit 3 41 Notes to the Financial Statements | 93 14 EMPLOYEE BENEFITS continued m Rm Year to Year to Year to Year to Year to Year to 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 31 December 14 a Employee pension plans continued 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Movement during the year Net surplus deficit in schemes at beginning of year 5 3 24 57 41 423 Disposed operations 12 148 Acquired operations 4 55 Contributions 8 44 94 49 55 Current service cost 2 4 3 24 49 41 Finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 27 31 23 319 383 318 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 25 28 18 295 346 249 Actuarial gain loss 2 13 46 24 161 635 Foreign exchange translation 3 69 19 74 33 Net surplus deficit in schemes at end of year 18 5 3 194 57 41 The actuarial gain for the year to 31 December 2004 represents 0.6% 2003: actuarial loss, 4.0%: 2002: actuarial loss, 15.4% of the total present value of scheme liabilities.
The actual return on pension scheme assets was 11 million R130 million more than the expected return 2003: 6 million R75 million less, representing 3.0% 2003: 1.8% of the total scheme assets.
Experience gains arising on scheme liabilities were 0.2 million R2 million 2003: 2 million R25 million.
Changes in the assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities resulted in an actuarial loss of 9 million R106 million 2003: 9 million R111 million.
At 31 December 2004, the provision for pension contributions included in other provisions and charges in the Groups balance sheet amounted to 55 million R597 million 2003: 53 million R632 million.
The charges to the technical and non-technical accounts represent the regular pension cost, offset by the investment return on the surplus scheme assets, and variations from regular cost arising from the schemes surplus being amortised on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees.
An analysis of the charge is presented below.

This means that the assumptions used for valuing liabilities are based on realistic expectations of future experience, plus prescribed margins for prudence and further discretionary margins to ensure that profits are released appropriately over the term of each policy.
The assets and liabilities have been valued on bases that are consistent with each other.
Where applicable, liabilities include provisions to meet financial options and guarantees.
Certain individual life mortality assumptions were reduced to better reflect ongoing mortality experience.
These were largely offset by an increase of 75 million R819 million in mortality discretionary margins so that profit continues to emerge over the terms of those policies.
Where applicable, allowance has been made for bonuses already declared, as well as future bonuses still to be declared at rates consistent with the assumed valuation interest rates.
These bonuses include both vested bonuses and non-vested terminal bonuses.
The valuation is sensitive to the rate of interest used to discount the liabilities for non-participating policies, assumed future mortality experience of policyholders and the level of discretionary margins.
The principal assumptions used at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 for the long term business are set out below: Rates of interest gross of tax and charges Mortality tables used Non-profit annuities Discounted on appropriate spot yield curve RMV92 with a percentage of CMI improvements adjusted for own experience With-profit annuities Interest rate on which premiums were based PA90 adjusted in line with own experience Assurances 11.0 per cent.
per annum Tables derived from own experience with allowance 2003: 11.0 per cent.
per annum for increasing AIDS claims 114 | Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued 31 TECHNICAL PROVISIONS continued The gross interest rates were reduced as follows, where applicable: to allow for tax: to allow for the minimum margin of 0.25 per cent.
per annum, as prescribed by the ASSA: in the case of smoothed bonus business, by an additional margin equal to the excess over the 0.25 per cent.
of the capital charges applicable to the business.
This second-tier margin is incorporated to ensure that the value of capital charges emerge as profit over the full duration of the policy: and in the case of certain non-profit annuities to allow for imperfect matching of assets and liabilities.
For assurances, the above underlying mortality rates were further increased by the prescribed ASSA margin of 7.5 per cent.
For annuities, the mortality rates were reduced by the prescribed ASSA margin of 7.5 per cent.
Renewal expenses Renewal expense assumptions including renewal commissions have been based on recent experience, inflating at 8.0 per cent.
In terms of the prescribed ASSA margins, the underlying expense assumption was increased by 10.0 per cent.
and the expense inflation assumption was increased to 8.8 per cent.
2003: 8.8 per cent.. Surrenders lapses Where appropriate, allowance has been made for surrenders and lapses at rates consistent with past experience.
The underlying lapse rates were increased by the prescribed ASSA margin of 25 per cent.
Surrender rates were increased or decreased by the prescribed ASSA margin of 10 per cent.
depending on which alternative gave rise to an increase in liabilities.
UNITED STATES Valuation methods and assumptions The valuation was performed using the applicable standards for US GAAP products in keeping with the applicable professional guidance notes issued by the American Academy of Actuaries.
This means that the assumptions used for valuing liabilities are based on realistic expectations of future experience to ensure that profits are realised appropriately over the term of each policy.
The valuation is sensitive to the rate of interest used to discount the liabilities, assumed future mortality experience of policyholders and assumed policyholder lapse experience.
The principal assumptions used for long term business are set out below.
Rates of interest gross of tax and charges Mortality tables used All products 2004: 5.0 per cent.
per annum 75-80 SU Table with appropriate modifiers 2003: 6.4 per cent.
per annum The gross interest rates were reduced for investment default assumptions and investment expenses.
Renewal expenses Renewal expense assumptions including renewal commissions have been based on projected costs with assumed inflation rate of 3 per cent.
Surrenders lapses Where appropriate, allowance has been made for surrenders and lapses at rates consistent with past experience.
UK AND REST OF WORLD Valuation methods and assumptions Technical provisions have been calculated using generally accepted actuarial methods for the territory in question, and using interest rates and actuarial tables appropriate to the territory in question.

In all other cases, in the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise as a result of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
On 21 June 2004, one of the Groups US asset management affiliates, Liberty Ridge Capital Inc. formerly known as Pilgrim Baxter & Associates, Ltd PBA, reached agreements with the US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC and the Office of the New York State Attorney General NYAG which settle all charges brought by these authorities against PBA in relation to market timing in the US mutual fund business.

134 | Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued 46 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued 46 f Market risk historical value-at-risk VaR 99%, one day by risk type This risk measure estimates the potential loss in pre-tax profit over a given holding period for a specified confidence level.
The VaR methodology is a statistically defined, probability-based approach that takes account of market volatilities as well as risk diversification by recognising offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.
The one day 99% VaR number represents the overnight loss that has less than a 1% chance of occurring under normal market conditions.
While VaR captures the banking businesss exposure under normal market conditions, scenario analysis and, in particular, stress testing are used to add insight to the possible outcomes under abnormal market conditions.
The banking business uses a number of stress scenarios to measure the impact on portfolio values of extreme moves in markets, based on historical experience as well as hypothetical scenarios.
The stress test methodology assumes that all market factors move adversely at the same time and that no actions are taken during the stress events to mitigate risk, thereby reflecting the decreased liquidity that frequently accompanies market shocks.
Key to the effectiveness of the scenario analysis programme is the timely review of the continued applicability of the scenarios, and this is built into the risk management process.
