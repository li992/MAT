The assets of the scheme are held independently from the companys finances and are administered by a trustee company.
Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary following triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
This scheme is no longer offered to new employees of the company.
A valuation of this scheme was carried out as at March 31 2001.
The assumptions having the most significant effect on the pension costs reported under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs are shown in the following table: Price inflation 2.5% p. a.
The surpluses or deficits identified from the valuation of the scheme are amortised over a period of 11 years using the straight line method.
The results of the triennial valuation of the scheme as at March 31 2004 have not yet been finalised.
However, interim valuations carried out as at March 31 of each year have highlighted the impact on the scheme of changing market conditions and falling investment returns.
As a result, the company agreed with the trustees to increase cash contributions to the Scheme from 12% to 15% of pensionable salaries from October 1 2003.
Additionally, pending completion of the 2004 actuarial valuation, it has been agreed to increase the pension cost charged in these accounts to 15% of pensionable salaries for the scheme, in line with the cash contribution rate.
The contribution rate paid by employees in the scheme is 5% of pensionable salaries.
The effect of UITF 6 Accounting for Post-Retirement Benefits other than Pensions, is not material.
Euromoney Pension Plan The Euromoney Pension Plan is a defined contribution arrangement under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
From February 1 2003 this plan was merged with the DMGT Pension Trust, an umbrella trust under which DMGT UK defined contribution plans are held.
Insured death benefits are also held under this trust.
The plan is contracted-in to the State Second Pension S2P and its assets are invested under trust in funds selected by members and held independently from the companys finances.
Following a review by the trustees, the investment and administration of the plan has been transferred from Scottish Widows to Fidelity Pension Management.
Overseas Pension Plans Institutional Investor Inc. contributes to a 401 k savings and investment plan for its employees which is administered by an independent investment provider.
Employees are able to contribute up to 15% of salary with the company matching up to 50% of the employee contributions, up to 5% of salary.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits As permitted by the transitional arrangements of FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the financial statements continue to be reported in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the defined benefit scheme since the scheme includes members from other companies within the Daily Mail and General Trust group.
Under FRS 17 the scheme will therefore be accounted for as a defined contribution scheme by the company.
Full disclosures in relation to the scheme are given in the accounts of the DMGT group.
Stakeholder Pensions The company provides access to a stakeholder pension plan for relevant employees who are not eligible for other pension schemes operated by the group.

No commitment or arrangement fees were paid to the banks in respect of the revolving credit facilities, but a fee is included within the 0.57% margin which is paid to the Daily Mail and General Trust plc.
This facility was due to expire on September 10 2005.
A new agreement was entered into in October 2004.
Euromoney is now one of a number of approved borrowers under a 300 million five year committed banking facility.
Interest is payable on this facility at a variable rate above US dollar LIBOR.
The variable rate is dependant on the groups net debt to EBITDA ratio and is within the range of 0.4% to 0.7%.
As at September 30 2004 there were 64.5 million of other uncommitted un-drawn facilities directly available to the group.

These comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the group which are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved, but exclude certain non-sterling borrowings which are matched by equivalent group assets or are treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.

These instruments take the form of forward exchange rate contracts to sell US dollars in exchange for sterling to meet the excess of sterling costs over sterling revenues as well as dividends in the parent company.
The group also uses interest rate swaps and interest rate cap and collar derivatives to minimize interest rate fluctuations.
Four new interest rate swaps have been entered into amounting to US$10 million, US$8 million, US$10 million and US$15 million each with Daily Mail and General Holdings Limited with effective dates October 1 2004, October 1 2004, April 1 2005 and September 30 2005.

The directors are of the opinion that based on recent and forecast trading, the level of profits in future years is more likely than not to be sufficient to enable the asset to be recovered.
A deferred tax asset of 1,258,000 has been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses 2003: nil.
A deferred tax asset of 6,600,000 has not been recognized in respect of overseas tax losses 2003: 9,700,000 as there is insufficient certainty in the current global market to be able to say that the group will be more likely than not to generate sufficient suitable overseas taxable profits.
The group is able to obtain tax relief in the US for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Utilization of the available tax relief in the US gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing difference will only reverse on a sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the group there is currently no intention to sell them.
The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the groups other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.
