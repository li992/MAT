We have reviewed the balances relating to the global Slim Fast business in light of the significant decline in the weight management category in North America during the second half of 2004.
Over the last few years, consumer tastes in this category have changed frequently, featuring low-calorie, low-carbohydrate, low-salt, low-sugar and other products.
The business declined in 2004 but maintained leadership of the category by refreshing its product range and offering a broader diet plan.
The impairment review determined the value in use using a discounted cash ow methodology for a period of 10 years.
The projections covered 10 years as management considers that this period more fairly reects the long-term value in this highly dynamic category.
The discount rate used was based on a pre-tax weighted average cost of capital and was 11%.
The result of the review indicated that a goodwill impairment charge of 591 million was necessary.
