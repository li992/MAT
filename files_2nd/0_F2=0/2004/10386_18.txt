54 MITIE GROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS for the year ended 31 March 2004 26 Pensions continued The Scheme is subject to triennial valuation by independent actuaries.
The last valuation was at 31 December 2003 and used the projected unit method, in which the actuarial liability makes allowances for projected earnings.
The following were the principal actuarial assumptions applied: Investment returns 5.65% per annum Pension increases 2.50% per annum At the last actuarial valuation date, the value of the assets of the Section was 299,000 and, in the opinion of the actuary, this value was sufficient to cover 144% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits As stated above, the Group operates two principal defined benefit pension schemes and contributes to the Executive Group Shared Cost Section of the Railway Pension Scheme.
The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosure have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at 6 April 2002, updated to 31 March 2004 by a qualified actuary.
As required by SSAP 24, the figures included in the Accounts in respect of the Group pension schemes are based on actuarial valuations carried out at 6 April 2002 and this does not take into account any impact of the movement in general stock market values since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next SSAP 24 triennial valuation as at 6 April 2005, based upon which subsequent pension costs will be determined until the adoption of FRS 17.
The figures currently used for accounting purposes as regards pension costs are likely to change significantly as and when FRS17 is adopted.
The costs of death-in-service benefit for members of the Scheme are fully insured by the schemes.
The projected unit valuation method has been used.
