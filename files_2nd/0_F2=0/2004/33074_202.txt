30 Share-based compensation plans As at 31 December 2004, the Group had a number of share-based compensation plans: i All-Employee Option Plans Local All-Employee Option Plans have been set up in 16 countries to enhance employee involvement with Unilever and its performance by providing a potential financial benefit linked to the Unilever share price.
There are no individual performance targets to be met.
The plans are aimed at participation by permanent employees in the country where the relevant plans apply.
ii Executive Option Plans The Executive Option Plans were introduced in 1985 to reward key employees throughout the world for their contribution to the enhancement of the Groups longer-term future and their commitment to the Group over a sustained period.
The grant is dependent on performance of the Group and the individual.
iii Share Matching Plans If managers invest part of their annual bonus in Unilever shares, the company will match this with the same number of shares on the condition that they keep all shares for an agreed number of years and will still be employed by Unilever on the vesting date.
iv The TSR Long-Term Incentive Plan This plan was introduced in 2001 and, depending on the TSR ranking see page 80 of Unilever in comparison with its peer group, it will potentially award top executives on the vesting date three years later with between 0% and 200% of the original conditional award.
v The North American Performance Share Plan A long-term incentive plan for North American managers, awarding Unilever shares if company performance targets are met over a three-year period.
vi The Restricted Share Plan Restricted shares have been awarded to a select number of executives for special performance.
After the agreed number of years the awards will vest provided the executives are still employed by Unilever at that time.
vii Other plans A cash-settled share-based retention plan was introduced in 2004 for a number of key executives.
Unilever will not grant share options in total in respect of executive share-based plans for more than 5% of its issued ordinary capital, and for all plans together, for more than 10% of its issued ordinary capital.
The Boards do not apportion these limits to each plan separately.
In recent years we have met the obligations under our share option and award plans by purchasing shares in advance and transferring them, in return for the exercise price, to Executive Directors and employees as the options are exercised or the awards vest.
The numbers in this note include those for Executive Directors shown in the Remuneration report on page 79 to 81.
No awards were made to Executive Directors in 2004, 2003 or 2002 under the North American Performance Share Plan, the Restricted Share Plan or the cash-settled share-based retention plan.
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any of the share-based compensation plans.
