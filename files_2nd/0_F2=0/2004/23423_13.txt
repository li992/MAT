Accounts Directors Responsibilities for Preparing the Accounts Company law requires the Directors to prepare accounts for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the Group as at the end of that year and of the net revenue and gains of the Group for that year.
In preparing those accounts the Directors are required to: select appropriate accounting policies and then apply them consistently on the basis of judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Accounts: prepare the Accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that proper accounting records are kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and of the Group and to enable them to ensure that the Accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them for safeguarding the assets of the Company and of the Group and for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements.
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
For this reason they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Accounts.
