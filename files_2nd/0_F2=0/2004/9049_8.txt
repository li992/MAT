The information has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulatory Accounting Guidelines issued by the Director General of Water Services.
These common services costs were recharged to an associate company as turnover then subsequently charged back as part of a contract.
This is not consistent with the statutory accounts presentation.
The accounting policies set out on pages 13 to 16 apply to the historical cost regulatory accounting information, with the exception of the accounting for infrastructure assets explained in Note 15 on page 54 and the investment in The York Waterworks Ltd explained in Note 1 on page 40.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES - CURRENT COST INFORMATION The current cost information has been prepared for the Appointed Business of Yorkshire Water Services Ltd in accordance with guidance issued by the Director General of Water Services for modified real terms financial statements suitable for regulation in the water industry.
Profitability is measured on the basis of real financial capital maintenance in the context of assets which are valued at their modern equivalent asset value to the business.
The accounting policies used are the same as those adopted in the statutory historical cost accounts, except as set out below.
Infrastructure assets As noted on page 34, FRS 12 has not been implemented in the regulatory accounts and the difference between planned and actual expenditure on infrastructure renewals is shown as a provision within working capital in the current cost balance sheet.
Tangible fixed assets Assets in operational use are valued at the replacement cost of their operating capability.
To the extent that the regulatory regime does not allow such assets to earn a return high enough to justify that value, this represents a modification of the value to the business principle.
Also, no provision is made for the possible funding of future replacements of assets by contributions from third parties and, to the extent that some of those assets would on replacement be so funded, replacement cost again differs from value to the business.
Redundant assets are valued at their recoverable amount.
The modern equivalent asset values arising from the last Periodic Review are incorporated in the 2003 04 Regulatory Accounting Information.
- Land and buildings Non-specialised operational properties are valued on the basis of open market value for existing use and have been expressed in real terms by indexing using the Retail Price Index RPI.
Specialised operational properties are valued at the lower of depreciated replacement cost and recoverable amount, restated annually between periodic Asset Management Plan AMP reviews by adjusting for inflation as measured by changes in the RPI.
The unamortised portion of third party contributions received is deducted in arriving at net operating assets as described below.
- Infrastructure assets Mains, sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls are valued at replacement cost, determined principally on the basis of data provided by the AMP.
Values now reflect the AMP carried out at the last Periodic Review.
A process of continuing refinement of asset records is expected to produce adjustments to existing values when periodic reviews of the AMP take place.
In the intervening years, values are restated to take account of changes in the general level of inflation, as measured by changes in the RPI over the year.
39 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information - Other fixed assets All other fixed assets are valued periodically at depreciated replacement cost.
Between periodic AMP reviews, values are restated for inflation as measured by changes in the RPI.
- Surplus land Surplus land is valued at recoverable amount, taking into account that part of any proceeds to be passed on to customers under Condition B of the Instrument of Appointment.
Grants and other third party contributions Grants, infrastructure charges and other third party contributions received since 31 March 1990 are carried forward to the extent that any balance has not been credited to revenue.
The balance carried forward is restated for the change in the RPI for the year and treated as for deferred income.
Real financial capital maintenance adjustments These adjustments are made to historical cost profit in order to arrive at profit after the maintenance of financial capital in real terms: - Working capital adjustment This is calculated by applying the change in the RPI over the year to the opening total of trade debtors and stock less trade creditors and the provision for liabilities and charges.
- Financing adjustment This is calculated by applying the change in the RPI over the year to the opening balance of net finance, which comprises all monetary assets and liabilities in the balance sheet apart from those included in working capital.
Investment in York Waterworks The intangible assets and investments accounting policy on page 14 of the accounts outlines the treatment of the transfer of the trade and net assets of The York Waterworks Ltd to Yorkshire Water Services Ltd.
In the regulatory accounts, the investment figure and compensating inter-company creditor of 16.6m have been netted to provide suitable comparisons with the previous year and consistency with the approach agreed with OFWAT.
RING FENCING In the opinion of the Directors, the company was in compliance with paragraph 3.1 of Condition K of the Instrument of Appointment at the end of the financial year.
This relates to the availability of rights and assets in the event of a special administration order.
40 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information 3.
APPOINTED AND NON-APPOINTED BUSINESS The historical cost accounting information shows separate figures for Appointed and Nonappointed Business.
The Appointed Business is defined to be the regulated activities of the Appointee, i. e. those necessary to fulfil the functions and duties of a water and sewerage undertaker.
The Nonappointed Business encompasses those activities for which Yorkshire Water Services Ltd is not a monopoly supplier or the activity involves the optional use of an asset owned by the Appointed Business.
DIRECTORS CERTIFICATE CONDITION F The Directors declare that the company will have available, for at least the next 12 months, sufficient financial resources and facilities to enable it to carry out its regulated activities and sufficient management resources to enable it to carry out its functions.
This assessment is based on the net worth of the company as shown in the accounts and on its Business Plan for the forthcoming year.
The Directors also declare that all contracts entered into with Associated Companies, and any arrangements made with any relevant authority for the discharge of any of the Appointee's sewerage functions, include all necessary provisions and requirements concerning the standard of service to be supplied to ensure that the company is able to meet all its obligations as a water and sewerage undertaker, as required in Section 6A.
2A 3 of Condition F of the Instrument of Appointment.
This opinion has been formed following examination of the documents in question.
DISCLOSURE OF TRANSACTIONS WITH ASSOCIATES Allocation of costs All direct costs are allocated immediately to the activity to which they relate.
Indirect costs and overheads are apportioned on an appropriate basis to reflect the incidence of such costs.
Indirect costs include administrative expenses and the provision of common services.
Direct costs attributable to the provision of services other than the Appointed Business are separately allocated and identified as 'Non-Appointed'.
Indirect costs, relating to nonappointed activities, are recovered as a fixed percentage of direct costs based upon the analysis of operating costs.

Total turnover for the year increased to 605.2m in 2003 04 2003: 583.7m, which represents an increase of 6.6% 3.7% after adjusting for inflation compared with the 6.3% overall increase in charges from 1 April 2003.
The impact of the tariff reduction of 13.1% in 2001 can be seen in the 2001 turnover numbers.
Operating expenditure adjusted for inflation has decreased steadily over the five year period due to continuing cost reductions and efficiency improvement but increasing capital maintenance costs arising from the large capital programme have led to an increase in overall operating costs in 2003 04.
Net interest payable has increased each year reflecting the company's increasing net debt level.
There has been a reduction in the overall tax charge for 2004.
The current year tax charge has increased by 7.4m to 19.0m, due to a higher taxable profits and reduced capital allowances.
The deferred tax charge has reduced by 22.2m to 12.2m reflecting a fall in the interest rate used for discounting purposes.
This 52 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information has been included in the accounts to comply with FRS 19 and its calculation is described in Note 8 of the statutory accounts on page 22.
Comparative figures prior to 2001 have not been calculated as this is not a requirement for statutory accounts.
Details of the dividend paid in the year and the underlying dividend policy are disclosed in the Directors' Report on page 6 of the statutory accounts.
The 2001 figure included an efficiency dividend of 98m.
53 Notes to the Regulatory Accounting Information The value of tangible fixed assets and related third party contributions have increased significantly over the five year period reflecting the substantial capital investment programme.
The operating review on page 1 of the statutory accounts describes the 2003 04 programme in detail.
Working capital increased significantly between 2002 and 2003 due to an increase of 243.0m in loans to the parent company which then reduced by 104.0m in 2004.
This is offset however by increases in net debt which occurred in 2003 and is included within creditors due over one year.
Fluctuations in the level of capital creditors have also affected working capital, particularly in 2000 and 2002, when figures were high.
The level of the infrastructure renewals provision has also decreased from 66.6m in 1999 to a prepayment of 5.5m in 2004.
The increase in creditors due over one year reflects the increase in net debt over the five year period.
Fluctuations in non-trade creditors due within one year are also mainly attributable to short term borrowings.
A deferred tax provision has been included in the accounts to comply with FRS 19 and its calculation is described in Note 18 of the statutory accounts on pages 27 and 28.
Deferred tax charges have been included for the current and previous years to comply with FRS 19.
Prior years' figures have not been calculated, as this is not a requirement for statutory accounts.
"RECONCILIATION OF BALANCE SHEETS IN STATUTORY AND REGULATORY ACCOUNTS In the preparation of its statutory accounts, the company has followed common industry practice and adopted the infrastructure renewals accounting basis as set out in FRS 15 ""Tangible Fixed Assets""."

It is not appropriate for us to assess whether the nature of the information being reported upon is suitable or appropriate for the Regulators purposes.
Accordingly, we make no such assessment.

56 Auditors Report on the Regulatory Accounting Information Basis of audit opinion We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board, except as noted below.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the regulatory accounts.
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the regulatory accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the regulatory accounts are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.
However, as the nature, form and content of Regulatory Accounts are determined by the Regulator, we did not evaluate the overall adequacy of the presentation of the information, which would have been required if we were to express an audit opinion under Auditing Standards.
Our opinion on the Regulatory Accounts is separate from our opinion on the statutory accounts of the company on which we report, which are prepared for a different purpose.

In these circumstances, to the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume any responsibility to anyone other than the company and the companys members as a body, for our Statutory audit work, for our Statutory audit report, or for the opinions we have formed in respect of that Statutory audit.
