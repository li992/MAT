54 54 Pr Premier Oil emier Oil Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Annual Report & Accounts 2004 22 Group pension schemes The group operates a defined benefit pension scheme in the UK The Premier Oil plc Retirement and Death Benefits Plan the Scheme.
The Scheme was closed to new members aside from the provision of insured death in service benefits in 1997 and a new scheme, providing benefits on a defined contribution scheme, was started.
Both schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to separately administered trust funds.
As a consequence of being closed to new entrants, the current service costs of the Scheme under the FRS 17 valuation will increase as the members approach retirement.
The pension costs for the Scheme are determined with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The last formal valuation was undertaken as at 1 January 2002 using the attained age method and market related funding basis, of which the principal financial assumptions were investment return: 6.8 per cent pa, salary growth: 4.5 per cent pa and pension increases: 2.5 per cent pa.
The market value of the Scheme assets was 7.9 million.
On the method and the assumptions adopted at the time, the assets covered 89 per cent of the members accrued benefits based on projected pensionable salaries.
During 2004, the employer contributed to the Scheme at the rate of 26.0 per cent of pensionable salaries.
Based upon the method and assumption adopted for the valuation after taking into account a lump sum contribution of 0.9 million paid in 2002, the new contribution rate was projected to eliminate the deficit over the future working lifetime of the Schemes active membership.
The ratio of the Schemes assets to its liabilities under the Minimum Funding Requirement MFR was 92.0 per cent as at 1 January 2002.
The principal financial assumptions adopted for this actuarial valuation were: % Rate of investment return 6.8 pa Rate of salary increases 4.5 pa Rate of pension increases 2.5 pa The group accounts for pension schemes in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs, and has not yet adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in full.
The following additional disclosures have been prepared, in compliance with the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of the membership data current as at 31 December 2004.

In practice, the Scheme invests in both equities and bonds and the future funding of the Scheme will continue to have regard to the statutory obligations in respect of the MFR and to conventional funding assessments.
In respect of the former, the Scheme actuary has confirmed his opinion that the ratio of the Schemes assets to its liabilities under the MFR at 31 December 2004 is approximately 100 per cent.
In addition, the group is paying unfunded pensions to two former directors of the company in regard to which annual increases and reversionary spouses pensions apply on the same basis as to pensions paid under the Scheme.
No payments were made in respect of unfunded pensions other than those disclosed in the Remuneration Report.
On the same actuarial basis as used to assess the Schemes pension costs, the present value as at 31 December 2004 of the future payments projected to be made in respect of the unfunded pensions currently in payment is US$1.7 million 2003: US$1.6 million.
