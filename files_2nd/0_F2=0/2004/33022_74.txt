At 31 December 2004 $22,923m 31 December 2003 $25,032m of the profit and loss account reserve was not available for distribution.
The majority of this non-distributable amount relates to profit arising on the sale of Astra AB to a subsidiary in 1999, which becomes distributable as the underlying receivable is settled.
During 2004, $2,109m of the profit was realised by repayment.
Subsequent to the year end, a further $1,625m was repaid on 25 January 2005, resulting in additional distributable reserves not included in the figures above.
Included in other reserves is a special reserve of $157m, arising on the redenomination of share capital in 1999.
