Contingent liabilities are either possible obligations that will probably not require a transfer of economic benets, or present obligations that may, but probably will not, require a transfer of economic benets.
It is not appropriate to make provisions for contingent liabilities, but there is a chance that they will turn into an obligation in the future.
Examples of the first type of contingent liability arise in respect of litigation against group companies, investigations by competition, regulatory and scal authorities and obligations arising under environmental legislation.
The estimated total of such contingent liabilities at 31 December 2004 was some 275 million 2003: 384 million.
Examples of the second type of contingent liability are guarantees issued by group companies.
At 31 December 2004 these amounted to some 143 million 2003: 166 million.
Guarantees given by parent or group companies that relate to liabilities already included in these consolidated accounts are excluded from this total.
The total value of guarantees which arose or were revised in 2004 was 80 million.
The fair value of guarantees is not material.
26 Acquisition and disposal of group companies Acquisitions The net assets and results of acquired companies are included in the consolidated accounts from their respective dates of acquisition.
The following tables set out the effect of acquisitions of group companies in 2004 on the consolidated balance sheet.
Acquisition accounting purchase accounting has been applied in all cases.
The fair values currently established for all acquisitions made in 2004 are provisional.
The goodwill arising on these transactions has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years in accordance with our declared accounting policies as set out on page 97.
During 2004 an additional investment into Langholm Capital Partners Fund was made and classied as an acquisition.
We also purchased some minority interests in subsidiary companies.
In 2003 the principal transaction was the acquisition at the end of March of the remaining shares in Asian food businesses from our joint venture partner Ajinomoto of Japan.
These businesses are now consolidated as subsidiaries.
