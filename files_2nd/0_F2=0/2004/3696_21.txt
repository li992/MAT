This adjusted tax charge is lower than the prevailing rates principally because part of the goodwill charge is an allowable expense for tax purposes and some Group expenditure on research and development qualifies for additional tax credit.
The tax assessed for the year is different to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2003 - 30%.
The differences are explained below: m 2004 2003 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 125.9 54.5 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate in the UK 30% 2003 - 30% 37.8 16.3 Effects of: Tax disallowed items 2004 primarily goodwill amortisation: 2003 primarily exceptional loss and goodwill amortisation 3.5 21.3 Capital allowances for year in excess of depreciation 1.0 0.2 Other timing differences 3.4 4.9 Overseas tax rates higher than UK rates 2.7 2.0 Expenditure qualifying for additional R&D tax deduction 1.1 0.7 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years 2.1 0.5 Current tax charge for the year 36.4 33.3 Factors that may affect future tax charges: The Groups effective rate of current tax on underlying profits is expected to be lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK primarily because of timing differences arising on fixed assets and because some of the goodwill amortisation is an allowable deduction for tax purposes.
The group expects that this will remain broadly unchanged in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value.
Also, no deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures as no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.

From 1 January 2003, new employees in the UK have only been able to join the defined contribution scheme.
In the USA, both the Carleton Technologies and Stanley Aviation defined benefit schemes have been closed to new members from 31 December 2003 and 31 January 2004 respectively.
Since the majority of the defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are closed to new entrants, the age profile of the schemes in service membership will increase over time.
Under the funding method prescribed by FRS17, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.

Parent Company The contributions paid by the company are accounted for as a defined contribution scheme, as the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme.
The cost of contributions to the Group scheme for 2004 amounted to 1.8m 2003 - 0.9m, comprising 0.2m 2003 - 0.2m of funding related to benefits accruing in the year and 1.6m 2003 - 0.7m of additional funding in order to reduce the scheme deficit.
Contributions for current benefit accruals represent 18.8% of pensionable salary 2003 - 12.5%.

The amount accrued in the financial statements in respect of deferred consideration payable in future years in respect of acquisitions made in 2004 is 0.4m.
A summary of all the undertakings acquired showing book values and fair value adjustments is as follows: FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS m BOOK VALUES REVALUATIONS ACCOUNTING POLICY TOTAL Tangible fixed assets 3.0 3.0 Intangible fixed assets 1.3 1.3 Stocks 9.4 0.5 8.9 Debtors 7.9 7.9 Cash at bank and in hand 0.8 0.8 Creditors and provisions 5.2 1.0 6.2 Loans 1.0 1.0 Pension liability 0.2 0.7 0.9 14.4 2.2 1.3 10.9 Goodwill note 10 49.9 60.8 Satisfied by: Cash and borrowings undertaken including expenses of acquisition note 24c 60.4 Deferred consideration 0.4 60.8 Included within the 10.9m fair value of assets acquired are assets relating to the Spectronic acquisition of 2.6m for which the valuation is provisional.
This provisional valuation is due to the size of the acquisition and its proximity to the year end.
As a result, further fair value adjustment may be required in 2005.
Fair value adjustments Revaluations The adjustments to stocks represent the increase in provisions against excess stocks and demonstration stocks.
The adjustment to creditors and provisions reflects accruals for dilapidation expense and provision for warranty claims offset by the deferred tax implications of the fair value adjustments made.
The adjustment to pension liabilities reflects pension deficits acquired.
Accounting policies The adjustment to intangible fixed assets reflects the write-off of items in line with Group policy.
26 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Set out below are the narrative disclosures relating to financial instruments.
The numerical disclosures are set out in notes 27 to 30.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption available under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments not to provide numerical disclosures in relation to short term debtors and creditors, other than currency risk disclosures.
Financial instruments The Group primarily finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and borrowings.
The Group does not use complex derivative financial instruments.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and to raise finance for the Groups operations.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group also uses forward foreign currency contracts to manage transactional currency risks arising from the groups operations and interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risks.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
ANNUAL REPORT & ACCOUNTS 2004 69 26 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
The policies have remained unchanged throughout the year.
Foreign currency risk The Group, which is based in the UK and reports in sterling, has significant investment in overseas operations in the USA, with further investments in other EU countries, Australia, Canada, South Africa and Asia.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
The Groups policy is to reduce, or eliminate where practicable, both structural and transactional foreign exchange risk.
Where significant, currency denominated net assets are partially hedged by currency borrowings.
Currency exposures are reviewed regularly and all significant foreign exchange transactions are approved by the parent company.
The pound US dollar exchange rate is the most important as far as Cobham is concerned, particularly given the level of US dollars which the subsidiaries expect to receive from their normal business activities.
In addition to the longer term borrowing structure, a number of financial instruments are used to manage the foreign exchange position, such as forward contracts.
As at 31 December 2004, US$221m of forward contracts were in place and stretching out to 2014.
These contracts are at an average exchange rate of $1.68: 1.
It is the Groups current belief that the net dollar receipts from its subsidiaries will exceed the level of the outstanding commitment.
The Group has transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures arise from sales and purchases by operating units in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The Groups policy is to minimise trading in subsidiaries non operating currencies.
However, where this is impractical the Group will seek to reduce its exposure through the use of forward contracts.
The Group does not hedge balance sheet and profit and loss translation exposures.
Generally, borrowings are arranged in local currencies to provide a natural hedge against overseas assets.
Interest rate risk The Group has various long and short term borrowings principally in sterling and US dollars at fixed and floating rates of interest.
The Group is continually monitoring its exposure to movements in interest rates in order to bring greater stability and certainty with respect to borrowing costs.
Group policy is to assess borrowings with regard to fixed or variable rates of interest depending on prevailing market conditions, including instances where interest rate swaps are used.
Surplus funds are placed on short term deposit.
These deposits have floating rates of interest, and thus there is some modest exposure to interest rates.
Liquidity risk The Group has a strong cash flow and where practicable the funds generated by operating companies are managed on a regional basis.
For short term working capital purposes in the UK, most operating companies utilise local bank facilities within an overall Group arrangement.
In the USA a central treasury function is maintained which all US subsidiaries use.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
As regards liquidity, the Groups policy has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long term borrowings with their lenders.
The private placement of Cobham guaranteed senior notes which raised US$225m in October 2002 enabled the Group to reduce short term and increase long term borrowings.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
Details of the year end position, which is in accordance with this policy, are given in note 29.
It is, in addition, the Groups policy to maintain undrawn committed borrowing facilities in order to provide flexibility in the management of the Groups liquidity: details are also given in note 29.
70 COBHAM PLC Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27 FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
Except where the exposure is hedged, foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group companies and the Group.

Hedges of foreign currency transactions As described above, it is the Groups policy to partially hedge foreign currency denominated net assets by currency borrowings.
As these are not formally matched, the Group recognises all gains and losses on these in the period they are incurred.

In addition provisions for liabilities and charges of 23.9m 2003 - 23.3m and long term creditors of 7.0m 2003 - 5.7m have been excluded as they do not meet the definition of a financial liability under FRS 13.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
For floating rate loans, fair values closely approximate to cost.
