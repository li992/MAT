Notes to the accounts YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES BASIS OF ACCOUNTING The accounts of the group are prepared under the historical cost convention in compliance with the requirements of the Financial Services Authority, all applicable accounting standards Financial Reporting Standard FRS, Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP and Urgent Issues Task Force abstract UITF and with the detailed accounting provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 18.
The directors consider that the accounting policies set out below remain most appropriate to the companys circumstances, have been consistently applied and are supported by reasonable and prudent estimates and judgements.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION The accounts of the group include the results of the company, its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
The results of undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the group profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES In the accounts of the groups companies, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date, or if appropriate, at the forward exchange rate.
Profits and losses on both individual foreign currency transactions during the year and monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
On consolidation, the profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the year and the balance sheets at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The exchange differences arising as a result of translating profit and loss accounts at average rates and restating opening net assets at closing rates are taken to reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance the groups equity investments in its foreign subsidiaries are taken to reserves only to the extent of the exchange differences arising on net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary is calculated using exchange rates applicable at the date of acquisition and is not subsequently re-translated at the balance sheet date.
TURNOVER Turnover comprises charges to customers for water and waste water services, excluding value added tax, together with the proceeds from the sale of commercial and residential properties to third parties.
PENSIONS The cost of providing retirement pensions and related benefits is charged to the profit and loss account over the period benefiting from the employees services in accordance with SSAP 24.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURE Research and development expenditure is written off in the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on fixed assets relating to research and development projects is written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
TIONAXAT The taxation charge in the profit and loss account is based on the profit for the year as adjusted for disallowable and non taxable items using current rates and takes into account tax deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, subject to the following: provision is made for gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets only where, at the balance sheet date, there is a commitment to dispose of the replacement assets, provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated that tax will arise based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred tax assets and liabilities.
43 KELDA GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the accounts YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid for a business, an associate or a joint venture over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which normally will not exceed 20 years.
Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
A useful economic life in excess of 20 years, or an indefinite life, is assigned to goodwill if the directors are satisfied that its durability can be demonstrated and that it is capable of continued measurement.
Goodwill with a useful economic life in excess of 20 years, or an indefinite life, is reviewed for impairment at each financial year end.
Prior to 1 April 1998, the groups policy was to charge the cost of goodwill directly to reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill originally charged against reserves remains eliminated against reserves, to the extent that it has not been charged to the profit and loss account on the disposal of the business to which it relates.
INFRASTRUCTURE ASSETS In the UK regulated water services business, infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams and sea outfalls.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets to increase capacity or enhance the network and to maintain the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service is treated as a fixed asset addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network based on an independently certified asset management plan.
Infrastructure assets in the US water services business are accounted for as for other tangible fixed assets.
OTHER TANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS Other tangible assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Finance costs incurred in respect of the construction of other tangible fixed assets are not capitalised.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is charged on other tangible fixed assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, or the estimated useful economic lives of their individual major components, from the month following commissioning.
Useful economic lives are principally as follows: Buildings 25 60 years Fixed plant 5 40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 3 10 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
LEASED ASSETS Assets which are financed by leasing agreements that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee finance leases are capitalised in tangible fixed assets and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor in borrowings.
Depreciation is generally charged to the profit and loss account over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the term of the lease.
If the operational life of an asset is longer than the lease term, and the agreement allows an extension to that term, the asset may be depreciated over its operational life.
The capital element of lease payments reduces the obligation to the lessor and the interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
All other leases are operating leases and the rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
44 KELDA GROUP PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the accounts YEAR ENDED 31 MARCH 2004 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED GRANTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS Grants and contributions in respect of tangible fixed assets, other than in respect of infrastructure assets as described below, are deferred and credited to the profit and loss account by instalments over the expected economic lives of the related assets.
Grants and contributions in respect of expenditure enhancing the infrastructure network are applied in reducing that expenditure.
This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985, which requires tangible fixed assets to be shown at cost and hence grants and contributions as deferred income.
The presentation is adopted because infrastructure assets do not have determinable finite lives and, therefore, such grants and contributions would remain as liabilities in perpetuity.
The directors consider that the groups presentation shows a true and fair view of the investment in infrastructure assets.
Grants and contributions received in respect of expenditure charged to the profit and loss account during the year are included in the profit and loss account.
INVESTMENTS Investments in associated undertakings in the group accounts are accounted for using the equity method of accounting where the directors consider that the group exercises significant influence over the associate.
Significant influence is generally presumed to exist where the groups effective ownership is 20% or more.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity basis where the company exercises proportionate control under a contractual arrangement.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the groups share of the operating results, interest, pretaxation results and taxation of the associates and joint ventures for the relevant reporting period.
The consolidated balance sheet includes the groups share of the net assets of the associates and joint ventures at the balance sheet date, including any goodwill on acquisition less any provision for impairment in value.
Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Kelda Group plc shares held in an employee share ownership trust ESOT are carried at cost as other fixed asset investments, less any provision for diminution in value under UITF 13.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
STOCKS Stocks are stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials and an appropriate proportion of overheads.
PROVISIONS Provision is made in accordance with FRS 12 for self insured third party liability claims incurred but not reported, and other known liabilities which exist at the balance sheet date.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DEBT INSTRUMENTS Debt instruments are included in borrowings at the net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs and any discount on issue.
Discounts and issue costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount.
Realised gains and losses that occur from the early termination of debt instruments are taken to the profit and loss account in that period.
ARDORW EFXCHANGE CONTRACTS Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast payments and receipts in foreign currencies.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities outstanding at the balance sheet date are re-translated at the forward exchange rate in appropriate cases.
INTEREST RATE SWAPS Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the groups exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings.
The amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are accounted for on an accruals basis through adjustments to the interest expense of the corresponding liability.
CURRENCY SWAPS Currency swaps are used to hedge exposures on foreign currency borrowings and foreign currency assets arising from fluctuations in exchange rates.
Borrowings hedged through currency swaps are shown in the groups balance sheet re-translated at the swap exchange rate.
The group uses hedge accounting in respect of its interest rate swaps only where the financial instrument does not exceed the underlying debt, the interest characteristics of the debt are altered and the contractual maturities do not exceed the maturities of the debt.
Hedge accounting is used in respect of currency swaps only where they relate to an existing asset, liability or firm commitment, and move inversely in relation to the foreign currency exposures of the groups activities.

Advantage has been taken of the exemption available under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present a profit and loss account for the company alone.
The parent company profit and loss account was approved by the board on 26 May 2004.

9 EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The ordinary shares held in the ESOT are excluded from the weighted average number of shares for this purpose.
For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year.

The goodwill can be demonstrated to be durable and is capable of continued measurement as defined by FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
In accordance with FRS 10 impairment reviews were carried out at 31 March 2004, which showed that the carrying value of the goodwill was not more than its recoverable amount.
This accounting treatment is a departure from the requirements of paragraph 21 of Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 and is adopted in order to present a true and fair view of the groups results.
If the goodwill arising on the US acquisitions had been amortised over 20 years, the amortisation charge for the period ended 31 March 2004 would have been 11.2m and the net book amount of this goodwill at 31 March 2004 would have been 183.1m 2003: 194.3m.
Goodwill in respect of the groups other acquisitions since 1 April 1998 has been assigned a useful economic life of 20 years.
Grants and contributions received relating to infrastructure assets are deducted from the cost of tangible fixed assets.
The groups accounting policy in respect of grants and contributions is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 requirements and is adopted as explained in note 1, in order to show a true and fair view of the investment in infrastructure assets.
As a consequence, the net book amount of tangible fixed assets is 259.3m lower than it would have been had this treatment not been adopted.

Provision has been made for all deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances and other material timing differences.
These deferred tax assets and liabilities have been discounted to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable in the foreseeable future.

F CURRENCY EXPOSURES The group may borrow in appropriate foreign currencies in order to mitigate the effects of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas.
The foreign exchange exposure on the translation into Sterling of the net assets of Aquarion, which are denominated in US dollars, is hedged by a mixture of US dollar currency swaps and forward contracts.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
There are no currency exposures on short term debtors and creditors or monetary assets and liabilities giving rise to a profit and loss account charge.
