Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2004 1.
Principal accounting policies Basis of preparation The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have been applied consistently throughout the current year and preceeding years with the exception of those described under Changes in accounting policy below.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards.
Changes in accounting policy and prior year adjustments a.
Interest in own shares As a result of the adoption of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the Groups interest in own shares, which was previously held within investments, is now presented as a deduction from equity shareholders funds.
The balance sheets at 31 December 2003 have been restated accordingly.
There was a 1.6 million reduction in net assets at 31 December 2003 as a result of adopting UITF Abstract 38. b.
Payments for media advertising A major part of the Groups business involves the purchase of media advertising from supplies on behalf of clients.
Payment for such liabilities frequently straddles the end of an accounting period.
This makes it necessary to assess which payments, some of which may be in transit or process, are to be treated as reducing the Groups cash balance at the period end, and which should be treated as paid subsequent to the year-end.
The Group has historically adopted the practice of treating as a payment, certain transactions for which payment was due prior to the period end but for which the formal transfer of funds took place after the end of the accounting period.
The Groups auditors have advised that, in their opinion, this treatment, although showing a prudent view of the cash balance at the balance sheet date is not an appropriate practice.
The Group has therefore decided to treat as paid only those transactions for which instructions to the Groups bankers for payment have been issued.
The effect of this change on the prior periods Group balance sheet has been to increase the amount shown as cash, and increase the amount shown as liabilities, by 117.2 million at 31 December 2003. c. Company balance sheet The Company has made an adjustment to its balance sheet as at 31 December 2003 to write down its investment in eVerger on a basis consistent to that presented in the published 2003 consolidated Group accounts.
The effect of this change on the Companys balance sheet at 31 December 2003 is to decrease other fixed asset investments and net assets by 13.2 million and also to increase the Companys loss for the year ended 31 December 2003 by 13.2 million.
There is no impact on the consolidated Group accounts.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the results, cash flows and net assets of Aegis Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings.
Where subsidiaries are acquired in the year, their results and cash flows are included from the date of acquisition up to the balance sheet date.
All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated.
The financial statements also include the Groups attributable share of associated undertakings and joint ventures results for the year and of their net assets liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Goodwill Prior to 1 January 1998, it was the Groups policy to write off purchased goodwill immediately to reserves and charge it to the profit and loss account only on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, the Group has elected to continue with this accounting policy.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10, goodwill arising on each acquisition on or after 1 January 1998 is capitalised as an asset in the balance sheet.
The directors review the estimated useful economic life of goodwill arising on each acquisition and, where this is considered finite, the goodwill is amortised over this period on a straight line basis not exceeding 20 years.
Following the first full year of ownership of an acquired business, the goodwill capitalised is reviewed for impairment.
The carrying value of goodwill may also be reviewed at any time if there is a new event or change in circumstance which may impact upon its recoverable amount.
Deferred consideration on acquisitions is provided based on the directors best estimate of the liability at the balance sheet date.
The liability is discounted and an imputed interest charge is included in the profit and loss account.
50 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Upon settlement, monetary assets and liabilities are re-translated at the rate ruling on the settlement date.
Monetary assets and liabilities at the year end are re-translated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon re-translation at the settlement date or balance sheet date are taken to the profit and loss account.
Short-term forward exchange contracts are used to hedge transactions with material foreign currency exposures.
Assets and liabilities denoted under such contracts are translated at the contracted rate.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation of foreign currency borrowings used to provide a hedge against foreign currency investments are taken directly to reserves.
For consolidation purposes, profit and loss accounts and cash flows in foreign currencies, arising in foreign subsidiaries, are translated into sterling at average exchange rates.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising upon consolidation are taken directly to reserves.
Financial instruments The costs of issue of capital instruments such as the issue costs of new debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument.
The Group has entered into a swap agreement to convert interest payable on its US dollar Loan Notes from fixed into floating rate based upon the US dollar six month LIBOR rate.
Under the terms of the agreement, the Group remits or receives the differential between the fixed and variable rate calculated by reference to the notional principal amount.
This differential is charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year to which it relates.
Turnover and revenue Turnover represents amounts invoiced for media handled by the Group on behalf of clients, together with fees invoiced for media and research services provided, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Media turnover is recognised when charges are made to clients, principally when advertisements appear in the media.
Fees are recognised over the period of the relevant assignments or agreements.
For the market research business, turnover is recognised either on completion of a project or on the satisfactory completion of a specific phase of a project.
Provision is made for losses on a project when identified.
Invoices raised during the course of a project are booked as deferred income on the balance sheet until such a time as the related revenue is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Revenue is the value of media and research fees and commission earned by the Group.
Research and development Research expenditure is written off as incurred.
Development expenditure is capitalised where the directors are satisfied as to the technical, commercial and financial viability of individual projects.
In such cases, the identifiable expenditure is deferred and amortised over the period during which the Group is expected to benefit.
This period is usually between three and five years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of all fixed assets, except freehold land, to their residual value over their expected useful lives.
It is calculated on the historic cost of the assets at the following rates: Freehold buildings 1%-5% per annum Leasehold buildings Over the period of the lease Leasehold improvements 10%-20% per annum or over the period of the lease, if shorter Office furniture, fixtures, equipment & vehicles 10%-50% per annum Leased assets Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
51 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 1.
Principal accounting policies continued Subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiaries are held in the Company balance sheet at cost less any provisions for impairment.
Associated undertakings and joint ventures Companies in which the Group has a participating interest and over whose operating and financial policies it exercises a significant influence are treated as associated undertakings.
Investments in associated undertakings are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less provision for impairment in value plus attributable post-acquisition retained profits or losses and amortisation of goodwill.
Attributable profits or losses are included in the Group profit and loss account in the year.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Amounts are included in the consolidated balance sheet at cost less provision for any impairment, plus attributable post-acquisition profits or losses.
In the case of the Groups joint venture in eVerger, no account is taken of the trading results of eVergers underlying investments.
Other fixed asset investments The Groups other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost.
Provision is made for any impairment in value.
Investment in own shares Investments in own shares, held through the Aegis Group Employee Share Trust, are shown as a deduction from shareholders equity at cost in accordance with UITF 38.
The costs of administration of the Trust are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Work in progress Work in progress comprises directly attributable costs on market research projects and is held in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Where leasehold properties remain unutilised by the Group and have not been sublet, provision is made in full for the outstanding rental payments together with other outgoings for the remaining period of the lease.
This provision takes into account any future sublet income reasonably expected to be obtained.
Future rental payments are charged against this provision in the period in which they are made.
Current taxation Current tax, including UK and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation Full provision is made for timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Pension costs Retirement benefits for employees are principally provided by defined contribution schemes which are funded by contributions from Group companies and employees.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is the contribution payable in the year.

Deferred consideration and other commitments Deferred consideration, which has been provided for in creditors, may be paid to the vendors of certain subsidiary undertakings in the years to 2009.
Such payments are either fixed under the terms of the acquisition or are contingent on future financial performance.
The directors estimate that, at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, the liability at 31 December 2004 for payments that may be due is as follows: 2004 2003 m m Within one year 48.6 19.3 Between one and two years 35.1 22.6 Between two and five years 6.2 10.7 89.9 52.6 The minimum liability is 13.9 million and the maximum is 106.8 million.
Put options held by outstanding minority interests There are put options held by certain minority interest shareholders in respect of Group companies in Spain, France, Thailand, Israel, Japan and Singapore.
The directors estimate the value of these contingent liabilities, based upon the profitability of the individual companies, to be approximately 5.9 million 2003: 9.4 million.
Guarantees At 31 December 2004, the Company had issued bank guarantees of up to 40.8 million 2003: 31.0 million.

In the view of the directors, the Group has no unprovided liability in respect of outstanding litigation.
Related party transactions There are no related party transactions which require disclosure in 2004.

65 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 22.
Financial instruments The Group has established objectives concerning the holding and use of financial instruments which are discussed in further detail in the Treasury Management section of the Financial Review on page 9.
The key objective is to manage the financial risks faced by the Group, which are discussed below.
Formal policies and guidelines have been set to achieve this objective and it is the responsibility of Group Treasury to implement these policies using the strategies set out below.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments nor engage in speculative arrangements and it is the Groups policy not to use any complex financial instruments, unless, in exceptional circumstances, it is necessary to cover defined risks.
Management of financial risk The Group considers its major financial risks to be currency risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk and credit risk.
The Groups policies with regard to these risks and the strategies concerning how financial instruments are used to manage these risks are set out below.
Currency risk A significant portion of the Groups activities take place overseas.
The Group therefore faces currency exposures on transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and upon consolidation following the translation of the local currency results and net assets liabilities of overseas subsidiaries.
The Groups foreign currency management policy requires subsidiaries to hedge all transactions and financial instruments with material currency exposures.
This is achieved using short-term forward exchange contracts.
At the year end, the aggregate value of transactions and related hedges was not material.
It is the Groups policy not to hedge exposures arising from the translation of profits or net assets as these represent an accounting rather than cash exposure.
The Groups policy is to borrow locally wherever possible to act as a natural hedge against the translation risk arising from its net investments overseas.
A currency analysis of borrowings is given below.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective of ensuring that adequate funding is in place is achieved by having agreed sufficient committed bank facilities.
The Group also seeks to manage its working capital requirement by requiring clients to pay for media in advance whenever possible.
At 31 December 2004, the Group had net debt before finance lease obligations and issue costs of new debt of 51.9 million 2003: 35.4 million.
The Group had cash balances and liquid short term investments of 276.0 million at 31 December 2004 2003: 264.6 million and gross borrowings of 327.9 million 2003: 300.0 million.
Included within gross borrowings is 122.6 million 2003: 119.8 million of 2 per cent convertible bonds due in 2006.
These bonds were issued on 15 May 2002.
Also included within gross borrowings is 83.0 million US$160 million 2003: 89.5 million US$160 million of unsecured loan notes issued on 20 November 2000.
These notes are repayable in full between 2006 and 2008.
In addition to the net debt at 31 December 2004, the Group has undrawn committed facilities of 231.6 million 2003: 200.0 million.
Further details are given on page 68.
Interest rate risk The Groups borrowings, excluding the convertible bond but including the unsecured loan notes referred to above, are at floating rates.
The Group has entered into long-term hedging arrangements to swap the interest relating to the unsecured loan notes from fixed into floating rates.
The Group has in place cash pooling arrangements in a number of territories.
These enable the Gr0up to minimise the interest paid on short-term borrowings and overdrafts, whilst allowing net surplus funds to be invested in interest bearing accounts.
An analysis of the interest rate risk profile of the financial liabilities and assets of the Group is given opposite.
66 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 22.
Financial instruments continued Credit risk Trade credit risk is managed in each territory through the use of credit checks on new clients and individual credit limits, where considered necessary.
In some instances, clients are required to pay for media in advance.
Short-term debtors and creditors and currency disclosures Short-term debtors and trade creditors have been excluded from all disclosures provided in this note.
Group companies do not have material, unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currencies.
Hence, no currency risk disclosures have been provided.
Maturity profile of financial assets and liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities is set out in the table below: Bank loans Bank loans and overdrafts Other Total and overdrafts Other Total 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 m m m m m m Within one year or less or on demand 121.9 121.9 90.3 90.3 More than one year but not more than two years 0.4 137.3 137.7 0.4 0.4 More than two years but not more than five years 68.3 68.3 209.3 209.3 Gross financial liabilities 122.3 205.6 327.9 90.7 209.3 300.0 The table above excludes obligations under finance leases of 0.2 million 2003: 0.2 million and issue costs of debt of 2.6 million 2003: 3.5 million.
The amounts disclosed above at 31 December 2004 include 60 million of bank borrowings due within one year drawn against the Groups 250 million Committed Revolving Credit Facility.
This borrowing can be extended under the terms of the facility, which matures in 2009.
With the exception of the Groups other fixed asset investments of 3.1 million, all financial assets have a maturity of less than one year.
Analysis of currency and interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities of the Group The currency and interest rate risk profile of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 December was: Fixed rate Floating rate Total Fixed rate Floating rate Total financial financial financial financial financial financial liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities liabilities 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 m m m m m m Sterling 81.4 81.4 64.5 64.5 Euro 121.7 13.8 135.5 118.2 0.9 119.1 US dollar 83.1 83.1 89.2 89.2 Other currencies 25.5 25.5 23.9 23.9 121.7 203.8 325.5 118.2 178.5 296.7 Interest is payable on the above floating rate financial liabilities excluding the US unsecured loan notes based on the inter bank offer rate in each country.
The weighted average interest rate for the year ended 31 December 2004 was 3.8% 2003: 3.3%.
The variable interest rate payable on the US unsecured loan notes is based on the prevailing US LIBOR rate.
Interest on the convertible bond, which comprises all of the fixed rate financial liabilities, is fixed at 2% with a 1.875% premium payable fixed until May 2006.
Issue costs to be amortised in respect of the convertible bond at 31 December 2004 are 0.9 million 2003: 1.6 million of which 0.7 million 2003: 0.7 million is included in creditors: amounts falling due within one year.
In addition to the liabilities above, the Group had creditors due after more than one year of 55.5 million 2003: 41.8 million which includes 41.3 million 2003: 33.3 million of deferred consideration on acquisitions, on which generally no interest is paid.
67 Aegis Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued For the year ended 31 December 2004 22.
Financial instruments continued Analysis of the currency and interest rate risk profile of financial assets of the Group The currency and interest rate risk profile of the financial assets of the Group at 31 December was: Cash at bank Cash at bank and in hand and in hand 2004 2003 m m Sterling 22.8 78.8 Euro 117.7 104.6 US dollar 71.2 37.3 Other currencies 64.3 43.9 276.0 264.6 The financial assets of the Group comprise cash balances and liquid short-term investments.
Floating rate cash earns interest based on the relevant national LIBID equivalent.
In addition to the financial assets above, the Group had other fixed asset investments of 3.1 million 2003: 2.5 million principally in US dollars, which do not yield an interest-related income and which do not have a fixed maturity date.
Fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities With the exception of the Groups 3.1 million other fixed asset investments principally in Harris Interactive Inc and the interest rate swap on the Groups US$ loan notes which is not included in the balance sheet, there are no material differences between the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets or liabilities.
The fair value of the Groups investment in Harris Interactive Inc at 31 December 2004 was 4.5 million based on that companys listed share price.
The fair value of the swap at 31 December 2004 was 7.2 million based on a discounted cash flow model and yield curves applicable 2003: 12.1 million.
This fair value represents unrecognised profits which the Group expects to realise as a result of lower variable interest payments under the swap compared with the fixed interest rate applicable on the underlying loan notes.
3.5 million of this unrealised profit is expected to be realised in 2005.
Borrowing facilities The Group had the following undrawn, committed bank borrowing facilities available at 31 December in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date: 2004 2003 m m Expiring within one year 100.0 Expiring between one and two years 41.6 Expiring between two and five years 190.0 100.0 231.6 200.0 On 23 August 2004, the Group entered into a new five-year revolving credit agreement replacing the existing revolving credit facility.
The new facility comprises a 250.0 million multi-currency revolving credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks.
Drawings under the facility bear interest at between 0.35% and 0.75% above LIBOR as periodically determined by reference to certain agreed financial ratios.
Of the amounts disclosed above at 31 December 2004, 41.6 million expiring between one and two years, being the undrawn amount of the Asian Bilateral Facilities, may be extended annually by the Group until 2008.
Market risk At 31 December 2004, it is estimated that a general simultaneous parallel shift of 1% in interest rates would reduce the Groups reported profit by approximately 0.3 million.
It is also estimated that a strengthening of Sterling by 1% would reduce 2004 profit before tax by approximately 0.7 million.
Currency exposures No Group companies have material unhedged monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than that of the local functional currency.
Hedges of future transactions At 31 December 2004 and 2003, there were no material foreign exchange contracts to hedge against future transaction flows.
