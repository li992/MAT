6 We begin our review of the year by reporting on our financial results.
Earnings The income we make on the Companys assets, after deduction Earnings of tax and expenses, constitutes the earnings of the Company.
In the year to 31 January 2004, our earnings rose to 75.40 Dividend pence per ordinary stock unit.
This increase, on earnings last year of 71.63 pence per ordinary stock unit, reflects dividend growth in the portfolio generally and investment of most of our Capital cash balances, but also receipt of some significant one off dividends, for example from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Company Record Mitchells and Butlers.
Such one off dividend receipts are not predictable and distort the underlying, sustainable, income flow.
The strength of Sterling against overseas currencies, particularly the US Dollar, reduced underlying earnings for the year.
Our total expense ratio is less than 0.3% of net assets or less than 0.2% after tax relief.
There is, however, an increase in operating expenses compared to last year.
The Company incurred significant non-recurring recruitment and restructuring costs in management succession planning and in making investment for continuing development.
Dividend In the interim announcement in August 2003, we referred to the fact that we had been gradually reducing the disparity between the interim and final dividends and had decided to take this a step further by raising the interim dividend to a level closer to 50% of the anticipated recommended final dividend.
Accordingly, an interim dividend of 35 pence per ordinary stock unit was paid in October 2003.
The directors are now recommending payment of a final dividend of 35.5 pence per ordinary stock unit.
If approved by the stockholders at the Annual General Meeting, this will make a total dividend for the year to 31 January 2004 of 70.5 pence, an increase of 1 pence on the previous period.
We anticipate being able to maintain a cautiously progressive dividend policy funded from recurring income, rather than special receipts.

In the US, where Source: Thomson Financial Datastream we have close to 21% of our assets, the depreciation of the US Dollar by nearly 11% against Sterling reduced stock market returns on a currency adjusted basis, from 32% to just 19%.

The figures investment we maintained our focus on companies better placed refer to capital performance only and make no allowance for income.
The in terms of management, market position, cash flow and FTSE All-Share Index is not used as a benchmark by the Company.
The companies which had been most exposed by the last downturn were those which performed best for much of the year.
With hindsight, we were too cautious about two areas in particular: Japanese banks, where we had no exposure, and IT hardware, where our exposure was limited.
This adversely affected our relative performance.
During the year the discount at which the stock price stands to the Companys net asset value narrowed to as low as 5% and ended the year at 10.8%.
