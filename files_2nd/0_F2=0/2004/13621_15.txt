36 Rotork Notes to the Financial Statements Annual Report 2004 for the year ended 31 December 2004 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS for the year ended 31 December 2004 Except where indicated, values in these notes are in 000 1.
Accounting policies The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements of the Group and of the Company.
Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention supplemented by the revaluations explained in note 11 to the financial statements and have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The Group has fully implemented FRS17, Retirement Benefits and UITF Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP trusts in these financial statements.
The comparative figures have been restated accordingly and the impact is explained further in notes 12, 20, 23 and 24.
Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the year to 31 December 2004.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the separable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries is amortised on a straight line basis over 20 years.
Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year and the results and cash flows of foreign subsidiary undertakings are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary undertakings, and from the translation of the results of those undertakings at average rate, are taken to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other foreign exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
Depreciation and amortisation Freehold land is not depreciated.
Long leasehold buildings are amortised over fifty years or the expected useful life of the building where less than fifty years.
Other assets are depreciated by equal annual instalments by reference to their estimated useful lives and residual values at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% Short leasehold buildings period of lease Machinery, plant and equipment 10% to 30% Leases Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements, which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital, which reduces the outstanding obligation so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding lease obligations.
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged as incurred on a straight line basis in arriving at the operating profit.
Notes to the Financial Statements Rotork 37 for the year ended 31 December 2004 Annual Report 2004 continued Stocks and work in progress Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost on a first in, first out basis and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all production overheads and the attributable proportion of indirect overhead expenses.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full, without discounting, on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, except for the items explained below.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the assets or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries where there is no commitment to remit those earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Turnover Turnover represents gross sales made and services supplied in engineering, excluding value added tax and returns and allowances.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development of the Groups products is written off against profits in the year in which it is incurred.
Pensions The Group operates a number of pension arrangements worldwide.
These include both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.
The assets of all the arrangements are held separately from the assets of the Group in independently administered funds.
The amounts charged against profits in respect of defined contribution arrangements are the contributions payable to those arrangements in the accounting period.
For the defined benefit arrangements the assets are measured at market values.
The liabilities are measured on the Projected Unit method, discounting at the current rate of return of a high quality corporate bond of the appropriate term and currency to the liability, as required under FRS17.
Defined benefit scheme deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
The movement in the deficit is split between operating charges, financing items and actuarial gains and losses in the statement of recognised gains and losses.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses forward exchange contracts to reduce its exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised in the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction is recognised.

Earnings per share Earnings per share is calculated for both the current and previous years using the profit attributable to the ordinary shareholders for the year.
The earnings per share calculation is based on 85.8 million shares 2003 restated: 85.7 million shares being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year.
The adjusted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholders before the amortisation of goodwill.
The adjusted numbers provide a more consistent measure of operating performance.
Diluted earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the ordinary shareholders and 86.4 million shares 2003 restated: 86.1 million shares.
The number of shares is equal to the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year and contingently issuable shares awarded under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

Pensions The Group operates a number of pension plans in the UK and overseas, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The assets of these schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The total pension cost for the Group was 2,035,000 2003 restated: 1,934,000 of which 1,039,000 2003: 878,000 related to the overseas schemes.
Included in the total pension cost is 533,000 2003: 412,000 in respect of defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension cost relating to the principal scheme that covers the majority of UK employees is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method, under which the current service cost per member will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The latest actuarial valuation of the principal UK scheme was as at 31 March 2004 and, for the purposes of accounting for FRS17, this has been adjusted to reflect the position at 31 December 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment return would be 5.1% on post-retirement related investments and 7.2% on investments for pre-retirement liabilities, that salary increases would average 3.7% per annum and that present and future pensions would increase at a rate of 4.5% on service accrued until May 2000 and at 2.7% for service after that date.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the assets of the principal UK scheme was 48.8 million excluding members Additional Voluntary Contributions.
The actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 84% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
This deficiency should be eliminated by 2013 by increasing the employers deficit contribution rate to 1.2 million per annum.
In addition, an ongoing employer contribution rate of 11.2% has been set for funding future service benefits.
The pension costs of the other defined benefit scheme that covers US employees have been determined in accordance with advice from an independent qualified actuary.
The Company is a member of a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS17 Retirement benefits the scheme has been accounted for, in these financial statements as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme.

The US scheme accounts for approximately 4% of the total liability.
The Company has a subsidiary in the Netherlands, the employees of which are members of an industry-wide pension scheme and any surplus or deficit cannot be associated with a particular employer.
Therefore, this has not been included in the results.
The total contribution to this scheme over the year was 58,000.
Analysis of the movement in deficit in the schemes during the year: Deficit in the schemes at 1 January 19,503 16,600 Contributions paid 7,040 1,897 Current service cost included in operating profit 1,502 1,500 Other finance charge 79 300 Actuarial loss 5,899 3,050 Currency gain 107 50 Deficit in the schemes at 31 December 19,836 19,503 Notes to the Financial Statements Rotork 55 for the year ended 31 December 2004 Annual Report 2004 continued 24.
Prior year adjustments As set out in note 1, Accounting policies, the Group has adopted FRS17 in full in these financial statements.
The full adoption this year of FRS17 has had the following impact on the accounts: 2004 2003 Increase in operating profit 633 397 Inclusion of pension finance cost 79 300 Increase in tax on profit on ordinary activities 137 30 Increase in retained profit 417 67 Increase in deferred taxation debtor 5,951 5,850 Inclusion of pension liabilities 19,836 19,503 Decrease in net assets 13,885 13,653 The impact of the prior year adjustment on the net assets as 31 December 2003 represents the inclusion of the FRS17 liability, net of deferred tax, of 13,653,000.
The impact of the prior year adjustment on the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2003 represents the reversal of the SSAP 24 net pension charges of 1,897,000 and inclusion of the net pension charges and associated tax under FRS17 of 1,830,000.
The impact on net assets at 31 December 2004 and on the profit and loss account for the year then ended represents the difference between the actual position following adoption of FRS17 and the position which would have been reported had SSAP 24 continued to be applied on the same basis as at 31 December 2003.
Note 1, Accounting policies, also states that the Group adopted UITF 38 in these financial statements.
The adoption of UITF 38 has had the following impact on these accounts: Decrease in investments 330 341 Decrease in reserves 330 341 The impact of the prior year adjustment on the net assets at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 represents the change in presentation of own shares held in the ESOP from requiring them to be recognised as an investment to requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
There was no impact on the profit and loss account of either year.

Derivatives and other financial instruments Financial risk and treasury policies The treasury department maintains liquidity, manages relations with the Groups bankers, identifies and manages foreign exchange risk and provides a treasury service to the Groups businesses.
Treasury dealings such as investments, borrowings and foreign exchange are conducted only to support underlying business transactions.
The Group has clearly defined policies for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate risk.
Group treasury is not a profit centre and, therefore, does not undertake speculative foreign exchange dealings for which there is no underlying exposure.
Exposures resulting from sales and purchases in foreign currency are matched where possible and the net exposure may be hedged by the use of forward exchange contracts.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in Financial Reporting Standard 13: Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures FRS13.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary and associated companies are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
As permitted by FRS13, short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the currency disclosures.
