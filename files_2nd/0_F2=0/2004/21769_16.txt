Change in Accounting Policy a Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes revised and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts The Group has implemented the requirements of UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes revised in 2004.
As a result, the charge to the profit and loss account in respect of shares and share options granted to employees that are expected to be met from shares held by employee share trusts is now based on the difference between the value on the date of grant and the exercise price.
Previously where shares were purchased to meet these obligations the charge was based on the carrying value of shares.
The Group has also implemented the requirements of UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts in 2004.
As a result, holdings of ordinary shares in Bradford & Bingley plc owned by the Groups employee share ownership trusts, are now shown as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Previously they were shown as own shares in the Balance Sheet with a charge to the Profit and Loss Account for costs of shares acquired above their eventual realisable value.
Purchases and sales of Bradford & Bingley plc ordinary shares are now accounted for as movements in shareholders funds.
These changes in accounting policy which have been accounted for as a prior year adjustment have a cumulative impact on opening reserves at 1 January 2003 of a decrease of 21.7m.
The effect is also to decrease administrative expenses and increase profit before tax by 1.0m in 2003.
The cumulative impact on profit attributable to shareholders is 2.9m.

Derivatives and other financial instruments a Financial instruments and risk management The Groups core business is to provide its customers with financial products appropriate to their needs, from mortgages and savings accounts to longterm investment products and insurance products.
The Group uses wholesale financial instruments to invest in liquid assets and to raise funds from wholesale money markets in support of its retail savings and mortgage operations.
These instruments also allow it to manage the risks arising from these business activities.
The Group has a well established formal structure for managing risks which includes formal risk policies, risk limits, reporting structures, mandates and control procedures.
The Groups approach to risk management and control is set out within the Financial Review on pages 16 to 17.
The Board delegates the management of all aspects of market and liquidity risk to the Asset and Liability Management Committee ALCO.
Financial instruments used by the Group for risk management purposes include off-balance sheet or derivative instruments.
Such instruments are used only to limit the extent to which the Group will be affected by changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
As part of its responsibilities, ALCO approves the use of specified off-balance sheet instruments within approved limits and business activities.
The Group does not undertake transactions for trading or speculative purposes and consequently all off-balance sheet financial instruments are classified as hedging contracts.
The principal off-balance sheet instruments used by the Group in managing its balance sheet risk exposures are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, interest rate futures, cross currency interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts.
These are used to protect the Group from exposures arising principally from fixed and capped rate mortgage lending, fixed rate savings products, deposit funding, foreign currency exposure and investment activities.
The duration of off-balance sheet contracts is generally short to medium-term and their maturity profile reflects the nature of exposures arising from underlying business activities.
At the year end the Group had no net material exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations or changes in foreign currency interest rates.
b Interest rate sensitivity gap A positive interest rate sensitivity gap exists when more assets than liabilities re-price during a given period.
Although net interest income tends to benefit from a positive gap when interest rates are rising and a negative gap when rates are falling, the actual effect will depend upon a number of factors, including the extent to which repayments are made earlier or later than the next reset or maturity date.

Where a market exists, market values have been used to determine the fair value of debt securities issued and held.
Where no market exists, discounted cash flow techniques have been used to determine the fair value using market interest rates for the relevant assets.
The fair values of off-balance sheet financial instruments have been determined using market interest rates in discounted cash flow techniques.
Fair values of interest rate caps and collars have been calculated using option-pricing models.

The above table shows the gains and losses on off-balance sheet derivative instruments used for hedging by the Group.
The gains and losses therefore do not represent absolute gains and losses expected by the Group as they will be substantially offset by corresponding losses or gains from on-balance sheet instruments.

Retirement benefits a Pension schemes The Company operates a funded defined benefit staff pension scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Staff Pension Scheme the principal scheme, administered by trustees, which is a closed scheme.
The fund is independent from those of the Company.
The normal pension age of employees in the scheme is 60 years.
Pension costs in the principal scheme are assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 October 2003.
The aggregate actuarial value of the schemes assets was sufficient to cover 110% of the aggregate benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The aggregate market value of the schemes assets held at 31 October 2003 was 352.6m.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The rate of return on investments has been assumed to exceed the rate of salary increases by 2.75% per annum and to exceed the rate of present and future pensions increase by 3.25% per annum.
This latter assumption is different from that used by the Company and Trustees in determining the contribution rate to the scheme where the investment return is assumed to exceed the rate of pension increase by 2.25% per annum.
The pension charge takes account of the surpluses disclosed, which are amortised over a period of 11.5 years, being the estimated average remaining service life of pension scheme members.
The Group also operates one further defined benefit scheme which is not material.
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme, the Bradford & Bingley Group Pension Plan.
The total pension cost for the Group was 11.1m 2003: 12.8m.
There were no liabilities or prepayments associated with the defined contribution scheme at the year end 2003: Nil.
b Other post-retirement benefits The Company provides concessionary rate mortgages and health care benefits to some of its pensioners.
The cost of health care benefits is provided for in accordance with the stated accounting policy.
The cost of concessionary rate mortgages is not significant and is recognised in the Profit and Loss Account as it is incurred.
c FRS 17 Retirement Benefits Whilst the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, the following transitional disclosures are required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.8 4.8 4.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.8 2.8 2.4 Discount rate 5.3 5.4 5.5 Inflation assumption 2.8 2.8 2.4 70 Bradford & Bingley plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 Notes to the financial statements 35.
Retirement benefits continued c FRS 17 Retirement Benefits continued The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 October 2003 has been updated by the actuary on an FRS 17 basis at 31 December 2004.
The demographic assumptions have not been changed from the ones used in the 31 October 2003 valuation.
In particular, the mortality assumptions have not been updated to reflect the latest available projections.
In respect of the pension scheme, more than one employer contributes to the scheme.
As the Group is unable to identify the share of the underlying assets and liabilities of all subsidiaries in the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and as prescribed by FRS 17, it has elected the multi-employer exemption.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: Expected Value at Expected Value at Expected Value at rate of 31 December rate of 31 December rate of 31 December return 2004 return 2003 return 2002 %m %m % m Equities 7.0 223.8 7.3 209.9 7.0 189.8 Gilts 4.5 118.4 4.8 106.4 4.5 43.6 Property 7.0 59.1 7.3 50.1 7.0 46.4 Bonds 5.3 26.3 5.4 19.3 5.5 48.6 Total market value of schemes assets 427.6 385.7 328.4 Present value of schemes liabilities 494.4 450.0 368.3 Deficit in the schemes 66.8 64.3 39.9 Related notional deferred tax asset 20.0 19.3 12.0 Net pension deficit 46.8 45.0 27.9 Under the FRS17 transitional rules, the following disclosure is provided on the performance statements for the years ended 31 December: 2004 2003 m m Analysis of amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 12.9 11.8 Total operating charges 12.9 11.8 Analysis of amount credited to other finance income Expected return on pension scheme assets 24.8 20.6 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 23.4 21.1 Net return 1.4 0.5 Analysis of amount recognised in the statement of recognised gains and losses STRGL Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 17.6 29.3 Experience gains and losses arising on scheme liabilities 6.9 3.0 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of scheme liabilities 11.4 56.1 Actual loss recognised in STRGL 0.7 23.8 Movement in deficit during the year Deficit in scheme at 1 January 64.3 39.9 Current service cost 12.9 11.8 Contributions 9.7 11.7 Other finance income 1.4 0.5 Actuarial losses 0.7 23.8 Deficits in scheme at 31 December 66.8 64.3 71 Bradford & Bingley plc Annual Report & Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 35.

Interest rates used for transfer pricing have been determined to retain the interest rate risk within Treasury.
Costs have been assigned to each segment based on resources consumed.
Transfer pricing in respect of mortgage origination by the Distribution segment has been determined on the basis of market rates for such activity.
b Exceptionals have not been allocated across business segments since they are the consequence of Group level decisions.
c For the purposes of segmental information, net assets have been allocated to Lending, Savings and Distribution on the basis of the regulatory capital framework.
The segments are not allocated capital during the normal course of business, therefore segmental profits do not relate to these net assets.
d The Group operates entirely within the retail financial services sector and accordingly no segmental analysis of turnover has been presented.
Please refer to the Financial Review for more information on segmental performance.
