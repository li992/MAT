52 P&O Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to these accounts.
Basis of preparation of accounts The accounts have been prepared on the historical cost basis, modied to include certain land and buildings at market value, and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 except as stated under land and buildings and properties held for development and sale.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards, and on a consistent basis except that the Group has adopted UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and its consequential changes to UITF abstract 17 Employee share schemes for the first time in its 2004 results.
Shares purchased through Employee Share Option Plan ESOP trusts are taken as a deduction in arriving at stockholders funds.
Previously these were held within investments.
The Group and Company balance sheets as at 31 December 2003 have been restated to reect this change in accounting policy, resulting in a reduction in stockholders funds of 13.0m at 31 December 2003, comprising a reduction in investments of 13.8m and a reduction in creditors of 0.8m.
The impact on the profit and loss account in the current and prior year is immaterial.
The Group has continued to follow the transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets in these accounts.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December each year.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
An associate is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest, usually from 20 per cent to 50 per cent of the equity voting rights, and over which it exercises significant inuence.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of associates is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the turnover and profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their assets and liabilities is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
Goodwill arising on consolidation Purchased goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously deducted from reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Goodwill is amortised to nil on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, which can be up to 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the Groups acquisition of its joint ventures and associates less accumulated amortisation is included in the carrying amount for the joint ventures and associates.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Investments In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates are stated at cost less any impairment in value.
Where merger relief provisions of the Companies Act 1985 apply, investments of the Company are accounted for on the basis of the nominal value of shares issued as purchase consideration.
Other investments are stated at historical cost net of provisions for impairment.
Land and buildings Land and buildings are included in xed assets at their latest valuations plus subsequent additions at cost, and surpluses and deficits on valuation are included in the revaluation reserve.
Land and buildings are valued at least every five years by external valuers.
profits and losses on sale of land and buildings are calculated by reference to their net carrying amounts.
In the case of freehold buildings and leasehold land and buildings annual depreciation is provided on a straight line basis.
Freehold buildings are written off over 50 years and leasehold land and buildings are written off over the remainder of the lease period.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Provision for any impairment in value of land and buildings held as xed assets is made in the profit and loss account, except in the case of land and buildings which have previously been revalued upwards, when the provision is made to the revaluation reserve to the extent of the previous revaluation.
Included in land and buildings are assets under construction, which are held at cost.
These assets are depreciated from the date on which they come into use.
Interest incurred in respect of assets under construction is capitalised into the cost of the asset concerned.
P&O Annual Report 2004 53 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Ships and other xed assets These assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Assets acquired under finance leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, the future capital payments being included in loans.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of these assets to estimated residual value, on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of the asset concerned.
Generally for ships this is between 10 and 35 years, and for other xed assets reported within plant and machinery, xtures and ttings various periods of up to 40 years, the most significant of which are cold storage facilities up to 40 years, port equipment, such as cranes and straddle carriers up to 25 years and other port equipment, such as forklifts, tractors and trailers 5 to 10 years.
Provision for any impairment in value of ships and other xed assets is made in the profit and loss account.
Assets constructed by the Group are depreciated from the date on which they come into use.
Properties held for development and sale Properties held for development and sale are included in current assets at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
For properties previously held for investment, which the directors have decided are to be developed or sold and which are reclassied as properties held for development and sale, cost is considered to be the latest valuation prior to their reclassication.
This treatment is a departure from the Companies Act 1985 which would normally require current assets to be carried at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The directors consider that compliance with this requirement would fail to give a true and fair view of historical revaluation surpluses, which remain unrealised by the Group until disposal.
Interest and other outgoings less income receivable are charged to the profit and loss account during development, except in respect of certain overseas properties where the development period is extensive, when such amounts are included in cost.
In certain subsidiaries, realised capital profits on the sale of properties are not ordinarily available for distribution and accordingly these capital profits are transferred to other reserves.
These capital profits can be distributed by the passing of a special resolution by the subsidiary.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year.
Turnover Turnover comprises amounts derived from the provision of goods and services to third parties excluding VAT and similar sales taxes and includes rent receivable from properties.
Turnover from the provision of goods includes sales of properties held for development and sale, recognised when contracts become unconditional.
Turnover from the provision of services is recognised on the delivery of those services, which for Ports is once the relevant throughput has taken place, for Ferries is on provision of carriage and for P&O Nedlloyd is on completion of the shipping or transport operation.
For Cold Logistics storage revenue is recognised over the period during which storage is provided and for its handling and transport operations on completion of the service.
Leases Ships, plant and machinery and land and buildings nanced by leasing agreements giving rights approximating to ownership are capitalised as tangible xed assets at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The capital element of future lease payments is treated as a liability.
The interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the finance lease in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
All other leases are classied as operating leases with the lease rentals payable being charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis.
Pension schemes Contributions for ongoing benefit accruals paid to schemes in respect of dened benefit pension schemes are calculated as a percentage, agreed on actuarial advice, of the pensionable salaries of employees.
The cost of providing dened benefit pensions is charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the periods benefiting from the services of employees.
Differences between the amounts charged to the profit and loss account and payments made to the pension schemes are treated as assets or liabilities.
Contributions including lump sum payments in respect of dened contribution pension schemes and multi employer dened benefit schemes, where it is not possible to identify the Groups share of the scheme, are charged to the profit and loss account when they are payable.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet dates except in respect of revalued xed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, gains on sale of assets which are rolled over into replacement assets and the remittance of taxable subsidiary, associate or joint venture earnings where no commitment has been made to the remittance of those earnings.
54 P&O Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Derivatives and other financial instruments Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised within the interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Noninterest bearing amounts due after one year are discounted at a rate approximating to current interest rates.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
profits and losses of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates which have currencies of operation other than sterling are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange except for material exceptional items which are translated at the rate ruling on the date of transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the year end exchange rates.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net assets of subsidiaries, branches, joint ventures and associates which have currencies of operation other than sterling and any related loans are taken to reserves together with the differences arising when the profit and loss accounts are translated at average rates and compared with rates ruling at the year end.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
On that date P&O disposed of its 50 per cent stake in P&O Nedlloyd for a consideration of e215m cash and a 25 per cent shareholding in Royal P&O Nedlloyd N. V. P&Os investment in Royal P&O Nedlloyd N. V. has been accounted for as an associate since that date.
The Groups goodwill amortisation charge relating to continuing operations was 14.1m 2003 13.8m.

During 2004, in view of the changed market conditions and the disappointing results for the Ferries division, the Group undertook a wide-ranging business review looking at the overall market and all aspects of the business.
On 28 September 2004 the Group announced the results of this fundamental business review, the central conclusion of which was that there would be a fundamental change in both the product offered to customers and the cost base of the business.
The review proposed to reduce the number of ships that P&O Ferries operates from 31 to 23 and to close four of its 13 routes and could result in a reduction of up to 1,550 jobs.
The outcome of the review indicated that the Group should perform an impairment review of the entire Ferries division.
The carrying values of the goodwill and xed assets of each of the Ferries divisions income generating units IGUs, being the Short Sea, Western Channel, North Sea and Irish Sea routes and Ferrymasters, were compared to their respective net recoverable amounts the higher of value in use to the Group and net realisable value.
The value in use for each IGU was calculated with reference to the net present value of the future cash ows projected to be derived from its assets, using cash ows to 31 December 2014 or shorter if the overall remaining life of the eet in service on the routes in the IGU was less.
These projection periods were used as management believes that the annual growth rate of the IGUs will be different from that of the average economic growth rates of the countries in which the business operates, which are within the European Union.
For periods beyond these dates the projections use a long term rate of growth less than the average long term rate of growth for the countries in which the business operates.
The discount rate applied to these projections was based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the division adjusted for the related underlying tax.
The effective pre-tax discount rate used was 10 per cent.
The impairment review indicated that the goodwill and xed assets of the Short Sea and North Sea routes and Ferrymasters were impaired resulting in an exceptional charge of 146.8m of which 145.7m has been charged to operating profit within the Ferries exceptional items see note 2 b and 1.1m shown as an amount written off investments.
As a result of the reorganisation arising from the Ferries fundamental business review, other tangible assets which are no longer required to service the routes have been written down by 36.4m and reorganisation costs of 83.9m are being incurred.
The reorganisation costs primarily comprise redundancies, costs relating to the lay up or sub charter of surplus ships and exit from port commitments.
These have also been charged to operating profit within the Ferries exceptional items see note 2 b.
On 24 January 2005 the Group announced that The HTC Hanseatic Trade Center GmbH & Co. Grundbesitz partnership HTC has sold the remaining four buildings of its ofce development in Hamburg to a consortium comprising afliates of Lehman Brothers Real Estate Partners, L. P. Tishman Speyer Properties and Quantum Immobilien AG.
Contracts for the sale have been exchanged with completion expected to take place during the first half of 2005.
The total net cash proceeds of sale, of approximately e200m 140m after costs, will be used to repay debt in the partnership.
The Group holds a 47.5 per cent equity interest in HTC.
When this transaction completes the Group will have exited all of its property interests in Hamburg.
Accordingly the Group has conducted an impairment review of its net investment in HTC, which indicated that the net investment in HTC should be written down to the net proceeds from the property sale.
An impairment charge of 60.2m has been made of which 31.0m was charged to operating profit within the Property divisions exceptional items see note 2 b and 29.2m shown as an amount written off investments.
60 P&O Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts 4 Exceptional items continued Within the Cold Logistics division following a change in approach to supply chain management by certain retailers in Australia, the Group believes it is unlikely that some existing contracts which expire between 2006 and 2008 will be renewed in their current form.
The Group considers that the surplus capacity that will result at some sites IGUs can be managed effectively, however in light of this anticipated change the carrying value of the relevant facilities has been compared to their respective net recoverable amounts the higher of value in use to the Group and net realisable value.
The value in use for the affected sites was calculated with reference to the net present value of the future cash ows derived from the use of the site, using cash ows to 31 December 2029.
The projections use a steady long term rate of growth which is less than the average long term rate of growth for Australia.
The discount rate applied to these projections was based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital for the division adjusted for the underlying tax.
The effective pre-tax discount rate used was 10.8%.
The impairment review indicated that the xed assets of the affected sites were impaired resulting in an exceptional charge of 10.0m which has been charged to operating profit within the Cold Logistics exceptional items see note 2 b.
During the course of the year certain other goodwill and tangible assets, principally within the Ports division, have been impaired totalling 6.5m.
Exceptional income of 10.8m was received in the year by the Australian operation of the Ports division.
Other separately discloseable items consist principally of the loss on sale of P&O Nedlloyd 65.4m including 44.3m of recycled goodwill, the profit on sale of Australian resorts 25.2m, the profit on sale of La Manga Club 6.8m and losses arising on the sale of certain Irish Sea assets 6.5m.

The Groups overseas tax rates are typically a mixture of rates higher and lower than 30 per cent.
They include the effect of overseas tonnage tax applicable to shipping operations, and overseas tax benets available to some infrastructure projects.
The joint ventures and associates tax rates are typically a mixture of rates higher and lower than 30 per cent.
They include the effect of P&O Nedlloyd operating under the UK and Dutch tonnage tax regimes, and overseas tax benets available to some infrastructure projects.
62 P&O Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts 6 Taxation continued c Factors which may affect future tax charges The UK tax losses not utilised can only be carried forward against certain categories of non shipping UK income, including receipt of overseas dividends.
The Group is subject to ongoing routine audits and enquiries from tax authorities around the world.
The eventual outcome of these may result in further amounts of tax payable which are greater or less than the related provisions held in the balance sheet.
The UK tonnage tax regime referred to above includes provision whereby a proportion of capital allowances previously claimed by the Group may be subject to tax in the event of a significant number of ships owned at the time the Group entered tonnage tax being sold and not replaced.
This contingent liability diminishes to nil over the period to 31 December 2008.
At 31 December 2004, the Groups contingent liability in respect of this provision would be 7.4m 2003 29.5m on the assumption that all ships and related assets are sold at book value and not replaced.
In accordance with FRS 19, no deferred tax has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.

In such circumstances the stock will be redeemed with a 20p premium within six months of the date of termination.
On a liquidation they are entitled to receive, subject to the rights of preferential creditors, all unpaid dividends and the amount paid up on their stock.
Holders are entitled to one vote on a show of hands and on a poll to one vote for every 4 nominal of stock held.

25 Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The principal scheme, The P&O Pension Scheme the P&O UK Scheme, is located in the UK and is a funded dened benefit scheme which was closed to routine new members on 1 January 2002.
The assets of the scheme are managed on behalf of the trustee by independent fund managers.
The Group also operates a number of smaller dened benefit and dened contribution schemes and makes contributions to various industry schemes.
These generally have assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs The pension charge for the year was: 2004 2003 m m The P&O UK Scheme 15.2 14.9 Merchant navy pension schemes 8.2 6.2 Other dened benefit schemes 7.3 7.1 Dened contribution schemes 8.6 8.1 Other industry schemes 4.7 5.5 44.0 41.8 In addition to the above a total of 0.5m 2003 2.6m has been charged in respect of ill health, early retirement and other pension augmentations.
For the principal scheme and certain other material schemes the pension charge for the year has been based on valuations in accordance with SSAP 24.
Differences between the amounts charged and the amounts paid are included within prepayments or creditors as appropriate.
As at 31 December 2004, the total prepayments amounted to 10.1m 2003 2.8m and total creditors amounted to 2.6m 2003 6.5m, giving a net pension asset in the balance sheet of 7.5m 2003 net liability of 3.7m.
A summary of the main financial assumptions for the P&O UK Scheme for SSAP 24 purposes for 2004 is set out below: % Discount rate 6.5 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2 Rate of increase in pensions 2.5 Ination rate 2.7 Under these assumptions there is a deficit in the P&O UK Scheme which has resulted in a pension variation charge for the Group, excluding the Groups share of P&O Nedlloyd, of 7.3m.
P&O Annual Report 2004 75 Notes to the accounts 25 Pensions continued FRS 17 Retirement benets For the purposes of the accounting disclosure requirements of FRS 17, the latest valuation of the P&O UK Scheme and those of other material dened benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2004 by qualied independent actuaries.
The principal assumptions are included in the table below.
The less material dened benefit schemes have been aggregated and the assumptions are given in the form of weighted averages.
These other schemes are principally in the UK, Australia, the USA and the Netherlands.
The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The P&O UK Scheme Other schemes 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 % %% % %% Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities 5.3 5.4 5.8 5.6 6.0 6.2 Rate of increase in salaries 4.2 4.2 3.8 3.6 4.0 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions 2.5 2.5 2.3 2.7 2.7 2.5 Ination rate 2.7 2.7 2.3 2.7 2.9 2.7 Following the latest triennial valuation of the P&O UK Scheme, deficit payments were individually attributed by the trustee to all current contributing companies, including an allocation of 38.5 per cent to the Groups associate P&O Nedlloyd.
As a result, for the purposes of the FRS 17 disclosure, the underlying assets and liabilities of the P&O UK Scheme were adjusted to reect this allocation from 1 January 2003.
This gives a net pension liability under FRS 17 that is consistent and reasonable with reference to the companies deficit contributions.
It should be noted that, if P&O Nedlloyd is not able to make payments due from it to the P&O UK Scheme, the trustee may seek additional payments from Group companies to make good the shortfall, thereby allocating more of the schemes assets and liabilities back to the Group.
Subsequent to the year end, P&O Nedlloyd has formed its own UK scheme and 25 per cent of the assets and liabilities of the P&O UK Scheme are in the process of being transferred into the P&O Nedlloyd scheme.
In addition, P&O Nedlloyd is making an exit payment of 70.0m into the remaining P&O UK Scheme.
As a result of this transfer and the exit payment, on a pro forma basis using 31 December 2004 data, the Groups share of the FRS 17 deficit in the P&O UK Scheme has reduced to 199.9m compared to 221.3m, as set out in the table below.
Group cash deficit payments into the P&O UK Scheme will be increased to approximately 30.0m a year, from 12.5m, but there is no effect on the profit and loss account.
The allocation of the P&O UK Scheme deficit payments has principally been to shipping companies within the UK tonnage tax regime.
These companies benefit from operating in the tonnage tax regime, and so will not receive tax relief for the payments and hence a related deferred tax asset is not recognised in respect of the FRS 17 deficit arising on the scheme.

As set out on page 75, from 2003 the Groups share of the deficit on the P&O UK Scheme excludes those assets and liabilities attributed to its associated company P&O Nedlloyd.
The movement on disposals represents 25 per cent of the P&O UK Scheme deficit attributable to P&O Nedlloyd at the date of the P&O Nedlloyd transaction described in note 14 g. The Group provides dened contribution 401k plans for its US employees and some post-retirement healthcare benefit plans, principally in the US.
The cost of these post-retirement healthcare benefit plans is not considered material to these accounts.
P&O UK Scheme actuarial valuation for funding purposes Formal actuarial valuations of 100 per cent of the P&O UK Scheme are carried out triennially by qualied independent actuaries, the latest valuation report for the scheme being at 1 April 2003, using the Projected Unit valuation method.
At this date the market value of the P&O UK Schemes assets was 996m and the value of accrued benets to members allowing for future increases in earnings was 1,154m giving a deficit of 158m and a funding ratio of 86.3 per cent.
The principal long term assumptions in the P&O UK Schemes 2003 valuation were: Nominal % per annum Price ination 3.00 Investment return on existing assets 7.10 Investment return on future contributions 6.60 Earnings escalation 4.50 LEL escalation 3.00 Increases in pensions in excess of Guaranteed Minimum Pensions 2.75 As a result of this valuation the Group and P&O Nedlloyd are making additional cash contributions of 12.5m per annum and 7.5m per annum respectively, which were scheduled to continue until 31 March 2015 but with a review of the level of these contributions to be undertaken at the next funding valuation.
An initial nine month catch up payment of 15m was made in January 2004 by the Group and P&O Nedlloyd, with monthly payments totalling 1.7m thereafter.
The establishment of the new P&O Nedlloyd Scheme led to the funding valuation being brought forward and it will be nalised during 2005.
The deficit payments will be increased from 2005 as described on page 75.
Excluding the deficit reduction payments described above, the future service contribution rate for the P&O UK Scheme was an average of 19.3 per cent from 1 January 2004.
Industry schemes The Merchant Navy Ratings Pension Fund MNRPF and the Merchant Navy Ofcers Pension Fund MNOPF are industry wide dened benefit pension schemes.
The MNRPF is a dened benefit multi-employer scheme in which sea staff employed by companies within the Group have participated.
The scheme has a funding deficit and has been closed to further benefit accrual.
P&O Annual Report 2004 79 Notes to the accounts 25 Pensions continued As at 31 March 2002, the date of the most recent full triennial actuarial valuation carried out by an independent actuary, the scheme had assets with a market value of 506m, representing 84 per cent of the benets accrued to members allowing for future increases.
The scheme had however exceeded its minimum funding requirement at that date.
Approximately 66 per cent of the schemes assets were invested in bonds, 23 per cent in equities and 11 per cent in property and cash.
The valuation assumptions were as follows: % Discount rate 5.8 Rate of salary increases 4.0 Rate of pension increases where increases apply 2.5 Expected return on assets 5.8 As a result of this valuation a revised xed schedule of payments has been drawn up which remains in place until 31 March 2007.
Companies within the Group, along with other employers, are making these payments into the scheme under a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding to reduce the deficit.
The Group is making contributions in respect of subsidiaries that are current employers in the scheme and in respect of subsidiaries that have settled the relevant statutory debt obligations and are no longer current employers within the scheme.
Current contributions and voluntary payments by the Group to the scheme in 2004 totalled 5.6m, which included amounts previously provided for.
These payments are included within the merchant navy pension schemes charge on page 74.
P&O has appointed an independent actuary to estimate the deficit of the MNRPF as at 31 December 2004 using the same assumptions as applied for the FRS 17 valuation of the P&O UK Scheme as set out above.
Based on the share of current contributions to the scheme by P&Os Group companies, the Groups share of the estimated deficit could be between 5m and 10m.
The Group cannot identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the MNRPF on a consistent and reasonable basis and is therefore accounting for the MNRPF under both SSAP 24 and FRS 17 as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
The MNOPF is a dened benefit multi-employer scheme in which ofcers employed by companies within the Group have participated and continue to participate.
The scheme is divided into two sections, the Old Section and the New Section both of which are closed to new members and the latest valuation was carried out at 31 March 2003.
The Old Section has been closed to benefit accrual since 1978.
The schemes independent actuary advised that at 31 March 2003 the market value of the schemes assets for the Old Section was 1,316m, representing approximately 115 per cent of the value of the benets accrued to members on the valuation basis.
The assets of the Old Section were substantially invested in bonds.
As at 31 March 2003, the date of the most recent formal actuarial valuation, the New Section had assets with a market value of 1,168m, representing approximately 86 per cent of the benets accrued to members.
The valuation assumptions were as follows: % Discount rate 7.8 Rate of salary increases 4.0 Rate of pension increases where increases apply 2.5 Expected return on assets 7.8 At the date of the valuation, approximately 59 per cent of the New Sections assets were invested in equities, 28 per cent in bonds and 13 per cent in property and cash.
It is unclear how the deficit will be allocated between employers and there is currently a court case in progress to establish the principles for such allocation.
For FRS 17 purposes although the employers contributions to the MNOPF would be affected by a surplus or deficit in the scheme, the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.
The Group is therefore accounting for contributions to the MNOPF as if it were a dened contribution scheme.
Based on information provided by the Trustee, P&Os share of the deficit payments could be 18 per cent or 4 per cent, depending on the outcome of the court case, with these gures potentially increasing if payments from other employers are not forthcoming.
P&O has appointed an independent actuary to estimate the deficit of the MNOPF New Section at 31 December 2004 using the same assumptions as applied for the FRS 17 valuation of the P&O UK Scheme as set out above.
P&Os share of the deficit under FRS 17 is estimated at either 125m for an 18 per cent share or 30m for a 4 per cent share.
Other industry schemes are mainly overseas multi-employer schemes, in which the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis.

However, no specic allegations have been made about the Company to date and no formal communication has been received from the European Commission on the matter since 17 March 2004.
In any event, the Company would defend its position strongly were that ever to be necessary.
Included within amounts receivable relating to previous corporate disposals is an amount outstanding of 32.2m net of relevant provisions arising following the sale of Bovis Group plc in 1999.
Pursuant to the sale terms P&O is obliged to provide loan funding and partial indemnification for one of Bovis projects, the construction of which is now completed and is the subject of litigation.
Bovis has been awarded damages against the client and the clients material counter claims including speculative claims for lost profits have been dismissed in the principal proceedings.
These are now subject to appeal.
Other related litigation continues including counter claims for consequential losses.
The prior dismissal of similar claims has resulted in opinions by outside counsel that these claims do not represent a material risk.

P&O Annual Report 2004 85 Notes to the accounts 30 Financial instruments continued The following tables show the Groups currency exposures, being exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit concerned, excluding certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
The amounts shown take into account the effect of any forward contracts entered into to manage currency exposures.

Other loans include term loans and finance leases.
These are largely at variable interest rates and therefore the book value normally equates to the fair value.
The fair value of other investments is based on the year end quoted price for listed investments and the estimated recoverable amount for unlisted investments.
The fair value of deferred consideration and other creditors is based on the estimated recoverable and payable amounts.
The fair value of cash and bank overdrafts approximates to the book value due to the short term maturity of the instruments.
The fair value of non-equity stockholders funds, which relate to the preferred stock and concessionary stock, is based on the quoted market price.
The fair value of derivative financial instruments is discounted to the net present value using prevailing market rates and foreign currency rates at the balance sheet date.
