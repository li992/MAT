The Davis Service Group Plc 34 Report and accounts 2004 Notes to financial statements continued 8 Pension arrangements Within the United Kingdom, the group principally operates an approved dened benefit scheme The Davis Service Group Retirement Benets Scheme.
The group has also established stakeholder arrangements on behalf of its UK employees.
Overseas, the only significant pension arrangements are the dened benefit schemes operated by Spring Grove Services Limited in Ireland and Sophus Berendsen.
Under such schemes the group discharges its pension obligations through actuarially determined contributions to schemes administered by insurance companies or government agencies.
The groups pension cost for the year with respect to Sophus Berendsen was 7,100,000 2003: 7,801,000 of which 1,059,000 2003: 897,000 related to dened benefit schemes.
Each of the UK dened benefit schemes is funded in accordance with the advice of qualied actuaries, is subject to independent actuarial valuations every three years and, where applicable, has its assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Payments in respect of dened contribution schemes or similar arrangements are made in accordance with the rules of the relevant scheme or arrangement.
The group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs and the disclosures given in a are those required by that standard.
The disclosures required under the transitional provisions of FRS17 Retirement Benets, to the extent not given in a, are set out in b : these provide information which will be necessary for full implementation of FRS17.
a SSAP 24 Details of the most recent actuarial valuation of the principal scheme, which accounts for 36% of the groups total pension cost, are as follows: Effective date 1st February 2004 Valuation methods Projected unit four categories Attained age two categories Main assumptions Investment returns Pre-retirement 6.5% pa Post-retirement 5.9% pa Pensionable salary increases 4% pa Employers contribution level as a percentage of pensionable salaries 15.2% Market value of scheme assets at effective date 85,628,000 The actuarial value of the assets of the scheme was sufficient to cover 64% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for future salary increases.
The then deficit of 47,448,000 before tax is being amortised over 15 years and is being paid in addition to the percentage of pensionable salary contribution for future service, at a rate of 4,000,000 per annum.
b FRS17 The actuarial valuations of the principal scheme, referred to in a above, and of the six other dened benefit schemes operated by the group have each been updated as at 31st December 2004 by qualied actuaries using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS17.
The assets of the scheme are stated at their fair market value as at 31st December 2004.
The principal actuarial assumptions used to calculate the schemes liabilities as at 31st December 2004 were: 2004 2003 2002 Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Sweden and Projected unit Sweden and Projected unit Sweden and Projected unit Valuation method Germany UK and Ireland Germany UK and Ireland Germany UK and Ireland Rate of increase in salaries 2.68% 4.00% 2.66% 3.50% 3.00% 3.53% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions: Excess over GMP pre 1st February 1999 Davis RBS only 5.00% 5.00% 5.00% Other 1.95% 2.94% 1.94% 2.53% 2.00% 2.53% Ination rate 1.95% 2.97% 1.94% 2.49% 2.00% 2.50% Discount rate 5.22% 5.47% 5.00% 5.96% 5.00% 6.00% The Davis Service Group Plc 35 Report and accounts 2004 8 Pension arrangements continued The assets and liabilities of the schemes together with the expected rates of return on the schemes assets are shown below: 2004 2003 2002 Long-term Long-term Long-term expected expected expected rate of return Valuation rate of return Valuation rate of return Valuation % 000 % 000 % 000 Equities 7.75% 75,801 6.58 68,139 6.58 51,683 Bonds 4.92% 37,516 5.48 33,046 5.48 25,707 Cash and other assets 5.75% 728 5.75 483 5.50 602 Total fair value of assets 114,045 101,668 77,992 Present value of liabilities 173,742 134,614 118,437 Net deficit in schemes 59,697 32,946 40,445 Related deferred tax assets 17,723 9,564 11,774 Net pension liability 41,974 23,382 28,671 The following disclosures are required under FRS17 arrangements, the balances of which would be reected in the financial statements upon full disclosure of FRS17.
