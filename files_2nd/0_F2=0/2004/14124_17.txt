38 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1 Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and, except for the treatment of certain grants and contributions, comply with the requirements of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 the Act.
An explanation of this departure from the requirements of the Act is given in the policy on grants and contributions below.
There have been no new accounting standards adopted in the year.
The group continues to adopt the transitional provisions of FRS 17, requiring certain additional disclosures which are set out in note 23. b Basis of consolidation The financial statements include the results of Severn Trent Plc and its subsidiary, joint venture and associated undertakings.
The results of subsidiaries, joint ventures and associated undertakings are included from the date of acquisition or incorporation, and excluded from the date of disposal.
The results of joint venture undertakings are accounted for on a gross equity basis where the companys holding is 50% and the company exercises joint control under a contractual arrangement.
The results of associates are accounted for on an equity basis where the companys holding is 20% or more and the company exercises significant influence.
c Turnover Turnover represents the income receivable, excluding value added tax, trade discounts and intercompany sales, in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
Revenue is not recognised until the service has been provided to the customer, or the goods which the sale relates to have either been despatched to the customer or, where they are held on the customers behalf, title has passed to the customer.
In respect of long term contracts, revenue is recognised based on the value of work carried out during the year with reference to the total sales value and the stage of completion of these contracts.
Income includes an estimation of the amount of mains water and wastewater charges unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon a measure of unbilled water consumed by tariff, which is calculated from historical billing information.
Revenue is recognised for software licence agreements for general release software at the time of client acceptance of the software.
Where software modifications are integral to the overall contract, software licence revenue is recognised over the life of the modifications.
Software support and maintenance revenue is recognised over the period it relates to.
d Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets comprise: i Infrastructure assets Infrastructure assets comprise a network of systems being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams and sludge pipelines.
Expenditure on infrastructure assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancements of the network and on maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance with the defined standards of service is treated as an addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charged for infrastructure assets is the estimated, anticipated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network less the estimated, anticipated level of relevant annual grants and contributions, based on the companys independently certified asset management plan.
ii Landfill sites Landfill sites are included within Land and Buildings at cost less accumulated depreciation.
The cost of landfill sites includes the cost of acquiring, developing and engineering sites, but does not include interest.
The cost of the asset is depreciated over the estimated life of the site on the basis of the usage of void space.
iii Other assets Other assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Years Buildings 30-60 Operational structures 40-80 Fixed plant 20-40 Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 2-15 Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until commissioned.
39 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 e Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the assets are accounted for as if they had been purchased and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a finance charge, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor and the finance charge being written off to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed in the year in which they are incurred.
f Grants and contributions Grants and contributions received in respect of non infrastructure assets are treated as deferred income and are recognised in the profit and loss account over the useful economic life of those assets.
In accordance with industry practice, grants and contributions relating to infrastructure assets have been deducted from the cost of fixed assets.
This is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Act, which requires assets to be shown at their purchase price or production cost and hence grants and contributions to be presented as deferred income.
This departure from the requirements of the Act is, in the opinion of the Directors, necessary to give a true and fair view as, while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, these assets do not have determinable finite lives and therefore no basis exists on which to recognise grants and contributions as deferred income.
The effect of this departure is that the cost of fixed assets is 362.6 million lower than it would otherwise have been 2003: 327.0 million.
Those grants and contributions relating to the maintenance of the operating capability of the infrastructure network are taken into account in determining the depreciation charged for infrastructure assets.
g Impairment of goodwill and fixed assets Impairments of goodwill and fixed assets are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of net assets of income generating units, including where appropriate, investments and goodwill and their recoverable amounts.
Recoverable amount is defined as the higher of net realisable value or estimated value in use at the date the impairment review is undertaken.
Net realisable value represents the net amount that can be generated through sale of assets.
Value in use represents the present value of expected future cash flows discounted on a pre-tax basis, using the estimated cost of capital of the income generating unit.
Impairment reviews are carried out if there is some indication that an impairment may have occurred, or, where otherwise required, to ensure that goodwill and fixed assets are not carried above their estimated recoverable amounts.
Impairments are recognised in the profit and loss account, and where material are disclosed as exceptional.
h Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less amounts written off.
i Stocks Stocks are stated at cost less provisions necessary to account for any damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and an element of overheads.
Development land and properties are included at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes the cost of acquiring and developing the sites.
The net realisable value of development land is based upon its value as a serviced site, after taking account of the cost of providing infrastructure services.
Turnover and attributable profits on properties under development are determined by reference to valuation of work carried out to date.
j Landfill restoration costs Provision for the cost of restoring landfill sites is made over the operational life of each landfill site and charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of the usage of void space.
Material restoration balances arising are discounted by applying an appropriate discount rate.
k Environmental control and aftercare costs Environmental control and aftercare costs are incurred over the operational life of each landfill site and may be incurred for a considerable period thereafter.
Provision for all such costs is made over the operational life of the site and charged to the profit and loss account on the basis of the usage of void space.
Material environmental control and aftercare costs are discounted by applying an appropriate discount rate.
l Insurance Provision is made for claims notified and for claims incurred but which have not yet been notified, based on advice from the groups external insurance advisers.
m Pension costs Costs of defined benefit pension schemes are determined by an independent actuary so as to spread the cost of providing pension benefits over the estimated period of employees average service lives with the group.
Costs of defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due.
40 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued n Foreign currency The trading results of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the year.
The net equity interests in overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
Exchange differences thus arising are treated as movements in reserves together with exchange differences on loans between group companies.
Exchange differences arising in respect of foreign exchange instruments taken out as hedges of overseas investments are also treated as movements in reserves.
All other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities of the company and its United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
In those instances where forward cover has been arranged, the forward rate is used.
Any exchange differences so arising are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency transactions arising during the year are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction.
All profits and losses on exchange arising during the year are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
o Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on tangible fixed assets relating to research and development projects is capitalised and written off over the expected useful life of those assets.
p Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is fully provided in respect of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes only to the extent that an entity has an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Material deferred taxation balances arising are discounted by applying an appropriate risk free discount rate.
For the purposes of discounting, the period over which accelerated capital allowances in respect of infrastructure assets reverse, is determined by the estimated annual cost of maintaining the operating capability of the network.
q Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on all acquisitions prior to 1 April 1998 remains eliminated against reserves.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is treated as an intangible fixed asset in the balance sheet and stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.
Capitalised goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
Useful economic lives are currently estimated at between 15 and 20 years, dependent upon the nature of the business and assets purchased.
r Euro costs Costs of preparing systems and other applications for the introduction of the Euro are written off to the profit and loss account as incurred, unless there is a significant enhancement to the system or application, in which case, the costs are capitalised and depreciated in line with the policy stated in d. s Derivatives and other financial instruments Debt instruments The financial costs of debt instruments are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Such costs include the cost of issue and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium arising on maturity.
Differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year on translation into sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term equity investments, are taken directly to reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Derivative financial instruments Financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and to a lesser extent currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the group and the financing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in financial instruments.
A review of how the financial risks are managed is included in the Financial review.
Financial instruments are accounted for as follows: Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity: Currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency investments.
The future currency exchange within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and any unrealised gain or loss is matched with that on the underlying asset or liability in reserves.
The interest coupon on such swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 17 to the accounts.
t Long Term Incentive Plan Shares in the company purchased for the Long Term Incentive Plan are held under trust and are initially recorded within investments in the balance sheet at cost.
The cost of the awards is taken to the profit and loss account over the period in which performance is measured.
u Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs incurred are written off as an expense, until such time as award of the contract becomes virtually certain.

This is further analysed below: Exceptional items in 2003 2004 comprise a 19.8 million profit from the disposal of fixed assets and a 2.7 million credit from the release of part of an exceptional charge made in 2001 2002, offset by a 10.9 million charge for Hales integration costs.
The exceptional profit on disposal of fixed assets during 2003 2004 of 19.8 million relates to the disposal of land and property by Severn Trent Water which is disclosed on the face of the profit and loss account see note 4 below.
Operating costs for 2003 2004 include a 10.9 million charge in respect of integration costs associated with the acquisition of Hales Waste 4.8 million in wages and salaries and 6.1 million in other operating costs.
This is offset by a 2.7 million release of part of the 25 million charge made in 2001 2002 in respect of certain Systems CIS Open Vision Contracts in the USA included in other operating costs.
Exceptional items in 2002 2003 comprise a charge of 46.8 million for the impairment of goodwill and tangible fixed assets in Services, offset by a 6.0 million credit from the release of an exceptional charge made in 2001 2002.
The 46.8 million impairment was determined in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
The impairment restated the relevant assets to value in use using a pre-tax discount rate of 10%.
42.5 million of this impairment charge was a write down of goodwill, the remaining 4.3 million was a write down of tangible fixed assets included in depreciation of owned assets.
The exceptional contract provision release of 6.0 million in 2002 2003 related to the release of part of a 25.0 million exceptional charge made in 2001 2002 in respect of certain systems CIS-OV contracts in the USA included in other operating costs.

4Profits on disposal of fixed assets Profits on disposal of fixed assets, expressed on a like for like basis, comprising only sales of land and property, have arisen as follows in the reported periods: 2004 2003 m m Profits on disposal of fixed assets 19.8 6.7 In the current period, profits on disposal of fixed assets amounting to 19.8 million have been shown separately as exceptional on the face of the profit and loss account, after operating profit, due to the materiality of the amounts involved.
In previous periods such profits on disposal shown above were not treated as exceptional and were reported within operating costs, given their relative magnitude.
Changes in analysis In prior periods, profits on disposal of fixed assets other than land and property were also reported within operating costs as part of a total figure for profits on disposals of fixed assets.
They are now regarded more appropriately as minor adjustments to depreciation.
A 1.2 million profit arising from such adjustments in the current year has been deducted from the depreciation charge.
A 0.2 million depreciation charge arose in 2002 2003.

c Factors affecting future tax charge The groups future current tax charge will be affected by the requirements of AMP4 which will impact both depreciation and capital allowances.
In addition the mix of profits from the different jurisdictions in which the group operates will have an impact on the effective rate of tax.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised on the US sub-group although these should be available to reduce the current tax charge in future years.
The estimated value of the deferred tax asset not recognised, measured at the UK standard rate of 30%, is 6.2 million.
The groups future deferred tax charge will be impacted by changes in interest rates.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.
Supplementary adjusted earnings per share figures are presented.

d Bank offset arrangements The banking arrangements of the company operate on a pooled basis with certain of its subsidiary undertakings.
Under these arrangements participating companies guarantee each others overdrawn balances to the extent of their credit balances.
Credit balances can be offset against overdrawn balances of participating companies.
23 Pensions and retirement benefits The group continues to account for pension arrangements in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Disclosures required under SSAP 24 are set out in note 23 a below.
SSAP 24 uses the results of the last formal actuarial valuation to determine the groups pension charge.
Thus the groups pension charge in 2003 2004 is based on formal actuarial valuations as at the dates set out below.
In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, which will replace SSAP 24.
Full adoption of FRS 17 is not required in the case of the Severn Trent group, until, at the earliest, the year ending 31 March 2006.
In the interim, certain additional disclosures are required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17, details of which are provided in note 23 b below.
a SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs disclosures The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes in the UK, covering the majority of UK employees.
The defined benefit schemes are fully funded to cover future salary and pension increases and their assets are held in separate funds administered by the trustees.
As the UK Waste Pension Scheme and the Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme are closed to new entrants, the age profile of scheme participants is expected to rise and hence service costs are also expected to rise in the future.
A formal actuarial valuation of each scheme is carried out at regular intervals by an independent professionally qualified actuary.
The UK defined benefit schemes and the date of their last formal actuarial valuation are as follows: UK defined benefit scheme Date of last formal actuarial valuation Severn Trent Water Pension Scheme STWPS 31 March 2001 Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme 31 March 2001 UK Waste Pension Scheme 6 April 2003 Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme 31 March 2003 The STWPS is by far the largest of the groups UK defined benefit schemes.
Benefits are also provided by the group on an unfunded, unapproved basis to a number of senior staff recruited since June 1989, whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Finance Act 1989 earnings cap.
Provision is made for such benefits by annual charge against the groups earnings totalling in the current year 1.8 million 2003: 1.2 million.
The group also operates defined contribution arrangements for certain of its UK and overseas employees.
In September 2001, the Severn Trent Group Pension Scheme an occupational defined contribution scheme was established to ensure compliance with stakeholder legislation and to provide the group with an alternative pension arrangement.
As from 1 April 2004, the STWPS has been amended with new defined benefit and defined contribution sections introduced.
As a result the schemes name has been changed to The Severn Trent Pension Scheme.
59 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 The most recent formal actuarial valuations of the groups UK defined benefit schemes were carried out using the projected unit method, except for the UK Waste Pension Scheme and the Severn Trent Mirror Image Pension Scheme, where the attained age method was applied, as both of these schemes are closed to new entrants.
The results of these valuations at the above dates including the unfunded arrangement for senior staff as at 31 March 2004 were as follows: STWPS Others Total m m m Market value of assets 793.7 133.3 927.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 744.8 172.1 916.9 Surpluses 48.9 48.9 Deficits 38.8 38.8 Net surplus deficit 48.9 38.8 10.1 Ignoring amounts which may or may not be recoverable and deferred tax.
The unfunded supplemental scheme is revalued each year using the assumptions used in the most recent formal actuarial valuation of the Severn Trent Senior Staff Pension Scheme.
The major assumptions used by the scheme actuary in the most recent valuation of the STWPS also the approximate weighted average of assumptions used for the most recent formal valuations of all group schemes were as follows: Price inflation 2.5% Salary increases 4.0% Pension increases in payment and deferment 2.5% Discount rate 5.7% Employers contributions to STWPS were increased from 1 April 2002 to 14.64%, 12.2% or 7.32% of pensionable pay previously 12.36%, 10.3% or 6.18% of STWPS members.
The contributions continued at this level in 2003 2004.
Employees contributions continue at the rate of 6%, 5% or 3% of pensionable pay.
Employers contributions to STWPS in the year to 31 March 2004 amounted on average to 13.9% of pensionable payroll.
The regular cost of STWPS to the group in the year to 31 March 2004 amounted to 13.9% of pensionable payroll or 10.9% after allowing for amortisation of surplus, which has been recognised in arriving at the pension charge for the year.
The total pension charge for all pension arrangements in the Severn Trent group accounts for the year ended 31 March 2003 after amortisation of surpluses and deficits amounted to 30.2 million 2003: 24.3 million.
28.2 million 2003: 23.0 million of this charge relates to the groups defined benefit schemes including unfunded charge and 2.0 million 2003: 1.3 million relates to the groups defined contribution arrangements.
Amounts carried in the balance sheet in respect of pension costs are not significant in the context of the group.
Formal actuarial valuations of the STWPS and the STSSPS are currently being undertaken as at 31 March 2004.
See Financial Review Pensions on page 16 for further information.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits additional disclosures The actuarial liabilities and the market values of the assets at 31 March 2004 of the groups defined benefit schemes and the unfunded arrangement for senior staff, details of which are provided above, have been assessed by the groups actuaries in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
The approximate weighted average of the major assumptions used by the actuary to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 31 March 2004 31 March 2003 31 March 2002 Valuation method Projected unit Projected unit Projected unit Price inflation 2.75% 2.25% 2.50% Salary increases 4.25% 3.75% 4.00% Pension increases 2.75% 2.25% 2.50% Discount rate 5.50% 5.25% 6.00% 60 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 23 Pensions and retirement benefits continued The assets and liabilities in the schemes and expected rates of return were: At 31 March 2004: Total fair Long-term rate value at of return 31 March expected at STWPS Others 2004 31 March 2004 m m m Equities 8.50% 595.8 90.3 686.1 Gilts 4.66% 92.4 47.0 139.4 Corporate bonds 5.50% 13.1 1.5 14.6 Property 6.58% 46.3 6.6 52.9 Cash 3.75% 38.3 5.5 43.8 Total market value of assets 785.9 150.9 936.8 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,098.9 205.4 1,304.3 Net deficit in schemes before deferred tax 313.0 54.5 367.5 Net group Total after Total deferred deferred deficit tax asset tax m m m Total schemes at 31 March 2004 367.5 110.3 257.2 At 31 March 2003: Total fair Long-term rate value at of return 31 March expected at STWPS Others 2003 31 March 2003 m m m Equities 8.25% 430.0 67.1 497.1 Gilts 4.53% 132.9 51.1 184.0 Property 6.39% 42.5 6.2 48.7 Cash 3.75% 12.5 3.7 16.2 Total market value of assets 617.9 128.1 746.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 898.2 172.9 1,071.1 Net deficit in schemes before deferred tax 280.3 44.8 325.1 Net Group Total Deferred total after deficit tax asset deferred tax m m m Total schemes at 31 March 2003 325.1 97.5 227.6 At 31 March 2002: Long-term rate Total fair rate of return value at 31 expected at 31 STWPS Others March 2002 March 2002 m m m Equities 7.75% 607.0 92.1 699.1 Gilts 5.15% 147.3 50.0 197.3 Property 6.45% 21.4 3.4 24.8 Cash 4.50% 10.4 2.9 13.3 Total market value of assets 786.1 148.4 934.5 Present value of scheme liabilities 758.0 146.0 904.0 Net surplus in schemes before amounts deemed irrecoverable and deferred tax 28.1 2.4 30.5 Less surplus deemed irrecoverable 12.4 12.4 Total recoverable surplus deficit in schemes before deferred tax 28.1 10.0 18.1 61 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Total Deferred Net group recoverable tax total after surplus liability deferred deficit asset tax m m m Schemes in surplus 34.1 10.2 23.9 Schemes in deficit 16.0 4.8 11.2 Total schemes at 31 March 2002 18.1 5.4 12.7 If the above amounts were recognised in the financial statements, the groups net assets and profit and loss reserve at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 would be as follows: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Reserves Net assets Reserves Net assets m m m m Excluding net pension surplus 1,802.1 2,219.3 1,808.4 2,219.8 Net pension liability surplus under FRS 17 257.2 257.2 227.6 227.6 Net liabilities already recognised in accounts under SSAP 24 net of deferred tax 2.4 2.4 2.2 2.2 Including net pension surplus 1,547.3 1,964.5 1,583.0 1,994.4 The weighted average employer contributions rates to all group defined benefit schemes expressed as a percentage of pensionable payroll were 14.9% in the year ended 31 March 2004 2003: 14.5%.
