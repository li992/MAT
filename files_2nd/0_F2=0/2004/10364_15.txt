The range of economic lives used for accounting purposes is in line with the asset lives typically used internationally by IT product companies for these types of acquisitions, which the Directors believe to be the most appropriate periods.
Goodwill capitalised on acquisitions totalled 45.6m in the year, 44.6m in respect of current year acquisitions and 1.0m in respect of prior year acquisitions.
In aggregate, 4.9m has been charged in relation to the acquisitions made in the year and 0.6m in relation to the disposals.
CURRENT YEAR ACQUISITIONS The Group has completed two acquisitions during the year which resulted in goodwill of 44.6m.
Within the Healthcare Division, the Group acquired the Patient1 product on 28 July 2003 for a consideration, including acquisition expenses, of $35.4m, of which $31.1m was paid in cash.
Within the Banking and Securities Division the acquisition of the Loan IQ product was completed on 7 January 2004 for a cash consideration, including acquisition expenses, of $43.7m.
These acquisitions have contributed turnover of 19.9m and an operating loss of 2.4m in the current year.
All acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The fair value table overleaf contains provisional numbers which will be finalised in the 2005 financial statements when further information will be available.
The analysis of the fair value of the net assets liabilities acquired for acquisitions during the year is shown in aggregate since no single acquisition is material in relation to the Group financial statements.

The accounting policy alignments primarily comprise the reversal of some of the ILF revenues that were being deferred over the life of the contract under US GAAP $13.4m.
The fair value adjustments primarily comprise the reassessment of the percentage of completion calculations on long term contracts $6.5m and the Directors valuation of amounts recoverable from debtors $4.9m and of the provisions in respect of obligations to perform development work $2.5m.
PRIOR YEAR ACQUISITIONS No further fair value adjustments have been made in relation to the acquisition of Crossmar Matching Service made in the prior year.
The fair values on the acquisition, on 12 September 2002, of Eagleye Solutions Limited and disclosed in the 2003 financial statements were considered provisional due to the uncertainty over the extent to which the maximum consideration of 15.0m would become payable.
During the year the fair value of the consideration that will be payable crystallised at 3.5m, 1.0m more than had been recognised previously.
As a result, goodwill capitalised has increased by 1.0m and additional goodwill amortisation of 0.2m has been charged in the current year relating to the period from acquisition to 31 May 2003.
62 18 Disposal and part disposal of operations CURRENT YEAR DISPOSAL AND PART DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS During the year the Group completed three transactions to dispose of all of the Misys Securities Trading Systems business and certain parts of the Misys Asset Management Systems business.
The disposals do not meet the criteria which would require them to be classified as discontinued operations on the face of the profit and loss account.
On 31 October 2003 the Group disposed of its 100% shareholdings in Misys Securities Trading Systems Limited and two smaller related companies.
On 20 November 2003 the Group disposed of its 100% shareholding in Misys Asset Management Systems Limited and, on 6 December 2003 it disposed of its 100% shareholdings in the remaining Misys Securities Trading Systems companies, primarily in the Asia Pacific region.
During the year these businesses contributed turnover of 13.3m 2003: 43.9m and operating profit before goodwill amortisation of nil 2003: 7.5m.
The aggregate consideration for the disposal of these businesses was 25.0m, before disposal costs of 6.0m.
Disposal costs include expenses and amounts in connection with onerous property provisions.
Consideration of 24.2m was received in cash, with the remaining amounts in the form of loan notes and deferred consideration.
The analysis of net assets liabilities disposed of for all of the above disposals during the year is shown below in aggregate since no single disposal is material in relation to the Group financial statements.

During the year, a total of 0.8m has been received, realising a profit of 0.8m.
Minority interests arising on the cumulative part disposal of AssureWeb Limited, together with a share of profit, have resulted in equity minority interests at 31 May 2004 of 2.9m 2003: 2.9m.
PRIOR YEAR DISPOSAL AND PART DISPOSAL OF OPERATIONS On 2 December 2002 the Group disposed of its 100% shareholding in Misys Claims Management Limited for a consideration of 0.6m, in the form of loan notes, producing a loss on disposal of 0.8m, net of disposal expenses.
As noted above, in 2002 the Group agreed to dispose of 40% of its equity in AssureSoft Limited over a three and a half year period.
In the prior year, a total of 1.8m was received, realising a profit of 1.1m.

No market exists for trading in these funds and they are held for long term growth.
The Directors have reviewed the Groups investments in certain entities that have previously been accounted for as associated undertakings.
During the current year these assets have been reclassified as investments as it is no longer believed that the Group has significant influence over these undertakings.

This was partly used to refinance existing indebtedness, with the balance available to finance future corporate activity.
The five year Eurobond is a 750m, fixed rate bond issued by Misys International Finance Limited and listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
The bond bears interest at 6.37%, but the net funding raised was converted into floating rate US dollar denominated debt through a series of interest rate and currency swaps.
J P Morgan Europe Limited contracted to subscribe on maturity of the bond or on its earlier redemption up to 750m for an issue of up to 750 million 1 preference shares by Misys International Finance Limited.
J P Morgan Europe Limited has sold its rights and obligations with regards to these preference shares to Interval Limited, a company that is independent of the Group.
Misys International SA, a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, paid 370m as an initial payment to Cordon Limited a wholly owned subsidiary of Interval Limited.
This figure represents the discounted price which will be supplemented by a further payment of 232m in December 2006, for the rights to the preference shares noted above.
Misys Finance Limited, also a wholly owned subsidiary within the Group, currently has a balance of 45m 2003: 130m deposited with Interval Limited at an interest rate of 4.63%.
This may be recalled at any time upon giving up to three days notice.
The Group has the ability to insist on a net settlement of the rights and obligations arising out of the above transactions.
There are no circumstances under which the Group would be obligated to redeem the bonds without being able to i offset the payment of 370m for the preference shares and ii recover the 45m deposit.
Accordingly the constituent elements of the above transactions have been offset in the Group balance sheet.
Similarly, as disclosed in note 6, the constituent elements have been offset in the profit and loss account.
Issue costs of 7.7m were included in the original carrying value of the debt.
The amounts in the balance sheet have been stated net of unamortised issue costs of nil 2003: 1.1m.
Finance costs are allocated to the profit and loss account over the expected term of the facility at a constant rate on the expected carrying value of the net debt.
The bonds are guaranteed by Misys plc and other companies within the Group.
The bank loans are unsecured, denominated in sterling, and currently bear interest at a rate of 5.02%.
The loans were drawn down against a revolving credit facility of $250m.
The facility commenced on 30 April 2004 with a maximum maturity of two years.
The Group is subject to certain financial covenants on its bank borrowings: these include a minimum ratio of operating profit, before depreciation and goodwill amortisation, to net interest: and a minimum ratio of operating profit, before depreciation and goodwill amortisation, to net debt.

During the year the amount of consideration for the acquisition of Eagleye Solutions Limited, made in the prior year, crystallised and is now held within creditors falling due within one year.
The property provisions comprise the net present value of the estimated future costs of vacant and sublet properties and the excess over market value for occupied properties of subsidiaries acquired in previous years.
The provision relating to vacant and sublet properties is expected to be utilised on average over the next five years and the excess over market value provision over the next eight years.
The IFA networks provision relates to the costs associated with lapse provisions of 25.2m 2003: 30.8m and regulatory review provisions of 12.1m 2003: 13.3m, which are expected to be utilised over the next three years.
The lapse provision is made for the expected value of the commissions reclaimable by product providers in respect of policies which may be cancelled during their indemnity period.
The regulatory review provisions include those for the FSAVC and pensions review processes, in addition to the costs in respect of the specific review outlined below.
These have been based on the average historical cost of redress payments, together with expected administrative costs and external fees.
The IFA network provisions are partly recoverable from members and through insurance cover, and are shown gross of the recoverable element, with the corresponding entry of 24.4m 2003: 32.0m held within debtors.
As highlighted in note 33, the general level of complaints made by consumers about advice given by their IFAs has continued to rise and our network members have not been immune from this trend.
The costs of handling these complaints, which are treated as an ongoing cost of doing business totalled 2.0m in the current year 2003: 1.0m.
Included in other provisions are amounts primarily in respect of litigation and non property related onerous contracts.
EXCEPTIONAL REGULATORY REVIEW COSTS An operating exceptional charge of 8.0m has been made this year for the estimated costs that will arise from the final stage of a specific review relating to a former network member.
The review is in respect of a specific type of product sold by this particular member more than four years ago.
Many of the sales were made before the former member became part of Sesame on the acquisition of Kestrel Financial Management Limited in 1999.
The initial review of a sample of cases was completed earlier this year and we are now well advanced in discussions with the FSA on what further work is required.
As a result we are now able to estimate the additional costs and redress payments that will arise.
As explained in note 34 of the 2003 Annual Report, this liability was contingent on the outcome of the initial review and the subsequent discussions with the FSA and as a result was previously disclosed as a contingent liability.
The charge has been treated as an operating exceptional item in the financial statements given its size and nature.

70 31 Post retirement benefits DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes covering the majority of its employees.
The costs of these pension schemes were 9.4m 2003: 11.7m and are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at either the beginning or the end of the financial year.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES Following consultation with the active members of the UK final salary scheme, and with the consent of the Scheme Trustees, the remaining active members of the UK scheme ceased to accrue benefits on the basis of their final salary during the year.
In future the benefits of the active members will accrue on a money purchase defined contribution basis.
As a result of this change, the final salary benefits of all members have crystallised and a one-off curtailment gain of 2.3m credited to operating profit.
The Group has also made special payments of 5.9m to address the current deficit of the scheme.
In addition, the Group operates a number of other smaller defined benefit arrangements.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the UK scheme was carried out as at 31 May 2002: this has been updated to 31 May 2004 by qualified independent actuaries.
The last full triennial actuarial valuations of the other Group schemes were carried out on a number of different dates: these have been updated to 31 May 2004 by qualified independent actuaries.

Included in the floating rate liabilities are 40.0m 2003: 40.0m drawn down under the revolving US dollar credit facility.
Fixed rate liabilities comprise property provisions and finance leases.
The liabilities on which no interest is paid comprise non interest bearing contingent consideration and property provisions.
These financial liabilities are disclosed in notes 25, 27 and 28.
Details of the Groups undrawn borrowing facilities at 31 May 2004 are given in note 27.
FINANCIAL ASSETS Financial assets primarily comprise cash deposits and fixed asset investments.
Cash which bears interest at nominal rates comprises 29.0m 2003: 40.2m denominated in sterling, 8.4m 2003: 9.6m in US dollars, 15.2m 2003: 10.1m in euros and 6.2m 2003: 5.6m in other currencies.
Cash deposits of 48.2m 2003: 44.3m denominated in sterling, accrue interest at rates based on LIBOR.
All cash and deposits are available on demand.
Fixed asset investments of 3.5m 2003: 2.8m primarily comprise contractual rights to receive financial assets from participating in US and European Technology Funds which are non interest bearing.
Full details of these assets are given in note 20.
In addition, the Group has a financial asset of 0.8m 2003: nil in respect of a debtor falling due in more than one year note 23.
73 Notes to the financial statements continued 32 Financial instruments continued FAIR VALUES OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Set out below is a comparison by category of book values and fair values of the Groups financial instruments.
The fair value is defined as the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidated sale, excluding accrued interest.
Market values, where available, have been used.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates with the exception of fixed asset investments.
Short term financial instruments are assumed to have a fair value equal to book value.
The book value is the amount recorded in the balance sheet.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been fair valued, based on the market price of comparable derivative financial instruments at the balance sheet date.
No market measure readily exists by which to assess the fair value of the Groups investments, primarily in the US and European Technology Funds, and future cash flows cannot be predicted.
As a result, a fair value cannot be established and therefore it has been assumed that their fair value is equal to book value.
The fair value of the WebMD warrants note 24 has been established using the Black Scholes model.

CURRENCY EXPOSURES To ensure compliance with the Groups treasury policy, as explained in the Financial Review, the Groups practice is to hedge currency exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
All the material assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation involved are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts, with the exception of foreign currency borrowings treated as a hedge against foreign net investments, and the initial payment of 370m made by Misys International SA MISA to Cordon Limited in 2002 note 27, the functional currency of MISA being US dollars.
Therefore, the Group has no material currency exposures requiring disclosure.
74 32 Financial instruments continued HEDGES Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off balance sheet unrecognised and on balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of forward foreign currency contracts used as hedges at the end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
Under the Groups accounting policy, foreign currency assets and liabilities which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward contract rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant asset or liability effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below.
UNRECOGNISED DEFERRED Gains losses all in millions Gains Losses Total Gains Losses Total At 1 June 2003 1.9 3.0 1.1 5.0 4.1 0.9 Less that arising in prior year recognised in the year to 31 May 2004 1.9 2.9 1.0 4.7 4.1 0.6 Arising in the year to 31 May 2004 not recognised at 31 May 2004 0.8 0.2 0.6 2.6 2.2 0.4 At 31 May 2004 0.8 0.3 0.5 2.9 2.2 0.7 At 31 May 2004 analysed as: Expected to be recognised within one year 0.8 0.3 0.5 2.9 2.2 0.7 Expected to be recognised in more than one year In addition to the amounts disclosed in the above table, as at 31 May 2004 the Group has unrecognised gains of 1.9m 2003: 1.4m in respect of cross currency swaps.
Any gains losses on these swaps will be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses in future years.
33 Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities which are quantifiable comprise property rental guarantees arising in the normal course of business, amounting to 7.3m 2003: 8.5m.
The Company has entered into a netting arrangement with its bankers, under which the Companys liabilities may be offset by the funds of other Group undertakings.
The Directors are of the opinion that this arrangement does not have a material impact on the results and financial position of the Company.
Within the Financial Services Division, the regulatory requirements governing the IFA network business receive significant attention.
Compliance with these regulations is subject to a process of ongoing review and appraisal by both the Financial Services Authority FSA and the Directors.
The general level of complaints made by consumers about advice given by their IFAs has continued to rise over the last year and our network members have not been immune from this trend.
This is due to increased consumer awareness and recent poor stock market conditions reducing investment values and likely returns.
In line with other networks and directly regulated IFAs we have again had to allocate additional resources to handle these complaints.
It is not possible to quantify if additional levels of redress to consumers will be required although in many cases these costs, if they arise, will be covered by insurance.
The costs of handling these complaints are treated as an ongoing cost of doing business.
The Groups subsidiaries and the Company can be parties to legal actions and claims arising in the ordinary course of business.
Whilst the outcome of current outstanding actions and claims remains uncertain, it is expected that they will be resolved without a material impact on the Groups financial position.

The goodwill written off to reserves was reduced by 65.7m in the year due to movements on exchange with the equal and opposite gain in the profit and loss reserve.
Included in net exchange adjustments are exchange losses of 9.6m 2003: 13.4m arising on borrowings denominated in, or swapped into, foreign currencies designated as hedges of net investments overseas.
During the year, the Company received nil 2003: 39,000 in respect of shares issued when savings-related options were exercised through the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST.
Employees paid nil 2003: 18,000 to the QUEST for these shares and the Company contributed nil 2003: 21,000.

The Company has 17.7m 2003: 17.7m of non distributable reserves.
PURCHASE OF OWN SHARES During the year, 45,408,995 2003: 25,155,566 ordinary shares were purchased by the Company, representing 8.1% 2003: 4.3% of the issued share capital of Misys plc, for a total cost, including expenses, of 94.5m 2003: 46.7m.
Of the total number of ordinary shares purchased: 1,708,995 2003: 21,862,445 shares were subsequently cancelled.
These cancelled shares were purchased at a cost, including expenses, of 4.6m 2003: 40.2m and represented 0.3% 2003: 3.8% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The nominal value of the shares was 17,000 2003: 0.2m which was transferred to a capital redemption reserve.
Profit and loss reserves were reduced by 4.6m 2003: 40.2m.
26,430,000 ordinary shares representing 4.7% of the issued share capital have been purchased for a total cost, including expenses, of 53.0m and held as Treasury shares, which was permitted from 1 December 2003.
These shares have not been cancelled but are held in a Treasury shares reserve within the profit and loss account reserve and represent a deduction from shareholders funds.
17,270,000 2003: 3,293,121 ordinary shares representing 3.1% 2003: 0.6% of the issued share capital have been purchased by the Misys Employees Share Trust and Employees Share Ownership Plan at a cost of 36.9m 2003: 6.5m.
MISYS EMPLOYEES SHARE TRUST MEST AND THE EMPLOYEES SHARE OWNERSHIP PLAN ESOP The MEST purchases shares in the market using funds contributed by the respective Group employer companies.
These shares are used to satisfy awards made under the Groups share incentive arrangements.
During the year it used shares with a cost of 8.2m 2003: 2.8m to satisfy share awards.
The Trustees of the MEST waived its rights to dividends.
The ESOP purchases shares in the market using funds loaned by the Company.
The share purchases are timed to ensure that the ESOP has sufficient shares to satisfy its requirements as and when its obligations fall due.
The Trustees of the ESOP waived its rights to dividends.
During the year the ESOP has used shares with a cost of 30,000 2003: 2.0m to satisfy its obligations.
PRIOR PERIOD ADJUSTMENT FOLLOWING THE ADOPTION OF UITF 17 AND UITF 38 UITF 38 was issued in December 2003 and requires shares held by ESOP Trusts to be treated as a deduction in shareholders funds, rather than as fixed asset investment.
