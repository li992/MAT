36 37 Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2004 1.
Accounting policies The Groups financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
Compliance with SSAP 19, accounting for investment properties, requires departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to depreciation and the explanation of the departure is given in Note 1 5.
The treatment adopted in respect of grants receivable relating to investment properties also represents a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 and is explained in Note 1 15.
The Groups principal accounting policies are set out below, together with an explanation of where changes have been made to previous policies on the adoption of new accounting standards in the year.
1 Changes in accounting policies The Group has adopted FRS 17, post retirement benefits, in these financial statements.
The full adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of adopting FRS 17 are given in Note 23.
2 Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of TBI plc and its subsidiaries, all of which are made up to 31 March 2004.
3 Turnover Turnover is recognised as the related services are provided.
Airport Ownership Turnover, excluding value added tax, represents income arising from the movement of aircraft and passengers, commercial income including income receivable in respect of various concession agreements and tenant income from rental arrangements.
Airport Services Turnover, excluding value added tax, represents income arising from the provision of services to airlines and airport operators.
Airport Management Turnover, excluding value added tax, represents income arising from management contracts operated on behalf of third party airports.
Other operations Turnover, excluding value added tax, comprises amounts receivable in respect of goods and services provided.
4 Tangible fixed assets at airports valuation policy On the acquisition of airports, tangible fixed assets are fair valued, normally by independent property consultants, on a basis consistent with the use of each of those assets.
Specialised property, including the airfield, runways, aprons, airport offices and other assets related to the landing and taking off of aircraft is valued on a depreciated replacement cost basis.
Non-specialised property is valued on an existing use basis.
Additions to specialised and non-specialised property, subsequent to acquisition, are included at cost.
These assets are depreciated in accordance with the policies set out in Note 1 6.
Property meeting the investment property criteria, and not occupied by the Company or its subsidiary companies, including certain terminal buildings and car parks together with other properties, is valued at open market value.
5 Investment properties In accordance with SSAP 19, accounting for investment properties, investment properties are revalued annually by independent property consultants and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to a revaluation reserve.
No provision is made for depreciation of investment properties.
This departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985, which requires all properties to be depreciated is, in the opinion of the directors, necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The depreciation or amortisation which would, had the provisions of the Act been followed, have reduced profit for the year is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount attributable to this factor cannot reasonably be separately identified or quantified.
Profits and losses on disposal of investment properties are included in the profit and loss account as part of the ordinary activities of the Group and are calculated as the difference between net sales proceeds and book value at the date of disposal.
TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 1.
Accounting policies continued 6 Depreciation The tangible fixed assets of the Group, excluding land, are depreciated on a straight line basis calculated to write down their cost to estimated residual values over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Airport operations Runways, taxiways and aprons 20-100 years Freehold buildings 50 years Car parks 20-50 years Plant and machinery 3-20 years Other operations Aircraft 10 years Hotel property 50 years fixtures and fittings 3-30 years Leasehold buildings are depreciated over the lower of 50 years and the remaining life of the lease.
In the case of tangible fixed assets relating to fixed term concession agreements, the above asset lives are subject to a maximum of the remaining life of the concession agreement.
Assets with an estimated useful economic life greater than 50 years are subject to annual review for impairment.
7 Leased assets Where the Group enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The present value of the minimum lease payments is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.
Rentals payable are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element which reduces the outstanding finance lease liability.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rentals charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
8 Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are included at cost less any provision for impairment.
9 Trade investments Trade investments are valued at cost less any provision for impairment.
10 Goodwill and other intangible assets In accordance with FRS 10, goodwill and intangible assets, since 1 April 1998 acquired goodwill is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life.
This has a maximum of 20 years and is subject to review for impairment.
Previously, goodwill arising on acquisition was written off directly to reserves at the date of acquisition.
Negative goodwill is credited to the profit and loss account over the useful economic life of the asset to which it relates, subject to any acceleration necessary in order to recognise an impairment of that asset.
The cost of other intangible assets is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the lower of 20 years or the minimum useful life of the related asset.
11 Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
12 Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities have not been discounted.
TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 38 39 Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2004 continued 1.
Accounting policies continued 13 Pension costs The Group operates defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes.
The pension costs in respect of the defined contribution pension schemes comprise contributions payable in respect of the year.
The assets of the defined benefit schemes are measured using closing market values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
The increase in the present value of the liabilities of the defined benefit schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities, arising from the passage of time, are included in net interest payable.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
14 Costs associated with the raising of finance Under the provisions of FRS 4, capital instruments, costs associated with the raising of relevant finance are accounted for as a deduction from the amount of consideration received.
The costs are then amortised over the life of the instrument.
15 Grants Grants receivable in respect of tangible fixed assets are credited to the profit and loss account over the expected useful economic lives of the relevant assets to which they relate.
Grants received but not yet released to the profit and loss account are included as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Grants receivable in respect of investment properties are credited directly to the cost of the asset.
This treatment is not in accordance with Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 which requires fixed assets to be shown at cost and grants as deferred income.
The treatment has been adopted in accordance with section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 in order to show a true and fair view as, in the opinion of the directors, it is not appropriate to treat grants on investment properties as deferred income.
Investment properties are not depreciated and accordingly no basis exists on which to recognise the release of deferred income to the profit and loss account.
The accumulated impact of this treatment is to reduce the deferred income and investment property costs by 1.4m 2003: 1.4m.
16 Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange prevailing at the end of the financial year and the results of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the year.
Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening investment in subsidiary companies, and from the translation of the results of those companies at the closing rate, are taken to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other foreign exchange differences on monetary items which are not effectively hedged in accordance with SSAP 20, foreign currency translation, are taken to the profit and loss account in the year in which they arise.
17 Capitalisation of interest Interest is capitalised on major development projects and capital works in progress where appropriate.
Capitalisation ceases when substantially all the activities necessary to get the asset ready for use are completed.
18 Financial instruments The derivative instruments utilised by the Group are currency swaps, currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps.
Currency swap and forward exchange contracts are translated at the rates prevailing in the contracts and the resulting gains or losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related assets and liabilities.
A derivative instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when it alters the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group.
Interest differentials on interest rate swaps are recognised by adjusting the net interest charge.

c During the year, the directors have reviewed the carrying value of the Groups Airport Services business given the slow recovery in this market sector post 11 September 2001.
As a result of this review and in accordance with FRS 11, impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, the directors have written down the carrying value of the goodwill attributable to this business by US$10.0m 5.9m.
d The Group has completed a refinancing of the project finance debt at London Luton with a repayment and cancellation of the previous facility.
The interest rate swap attached to the previous facility has also been cancelled resulting in a termination penalty of 2.0m after the release of a fair value provision of 3.9m.

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of goodwill associated with its Airport Services business, using discounted cashflows, in accordance with FRS 11.
This has resulted in a write down of US$10.0m 5.9m.
The discounted cashflows assume the following: A growth rate of 3% per annum A pre tax discount rate of 11% has been used to calculate the net present value of the expected future cashflows and has been based on the weighted average cost of capital of the Group as increased to reflect the particular circumstances associated with the Airport Services business TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 11.
The depreciation charge includes an amount of m nil 2003: m nil representing the depreciation of interest previously capitalised.
In addition, freehold land and buildings includes 17.6m 2003: 17.8m of land which is not depreciated.
The Group successfully agreed the establishment of a Ryanair base at Stockholm Skavsta with effect from April 2003.
The traffic profile arising from this base has completely changed the business fundamentals at the airport and is key to the future prospects of the business.
In March 2003, in accordance with good practice, a discounted cashflow model was developed to appraise the investment using assumptions relevant to the recent developments at the airport which is now used by the directors to confirm the carrying value of the tangible fixed assets.
This effectively replaced a discounted cashflow that had been prepared to evaluate the carrying value of the tangible fixed assets in March 2002.
Notwithstanding that the business has completely changed, in accordance with FRS 11, the Group is obliged to perform a look back test using actual cashflows for the period ended 31 March 2004 to replace the forecast cashflows for this period incorporated within the previous model.
This exercise identified the requirement to potentially write down the assets by some 10.0m at 31 March 2004 but the directors no longer consider the assumptions underlying the previous model to be appropriate in the circumstances.
By using the relevant discounted cashflow model prepared in March 2003, the directors have concluded that the potential write down identified by the look back test has reversed.
Included in the net book value of leasehold land and buildings above are long leasehold land and buildings with a cost at 31 March 2004 of 2.7m 2003: 2.6m and accumulated depreciation of 0.4m 2003: 0.3m.
The net book value of the Groups tangible assets includes 15.3m 2003: 11.0m Company: 0.3m 2003: 0.4m in respect of assets held under finance lease and hire purchase arrangements.
The depreciation charge on these assets amounted to 1.5m 2003: 1.5m Company: 0.1m 2003: 0.1m.
Other fixed assets comprise aircraft, plant and machinery, computers, motor vehicles and furniture, fixtures and fittings.
The tangible fixed assets of the Company relate to other tangible fixed assets as defined above.

Borrowings and financial instruments Treasury policy Treasury activity is managed centrally and is focused on monitoring working capital, managing external and internal funding and managing financial market risks in particular interest and currency exposures.
Treasury activity is not a profit centre and the Group neither enters into transactions of a speculative nature nor trades in financial instruments.
Treasury risk management policies are summarised below: Interest rate risk operations are financed through a mixture of bank borrowings, long term loans and hire purchase arrangements.
The Group borrows in appropriate currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and also uses interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest profile and to manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
It is the Groups policy to keep a proportion of its borrowings at fixed rates of interest and as at 31 March 2004 some 67% 2003: 70% was either at a fixed rate or subject to hedging arrangements.
Liquidity risk the Groups policy is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility.
As at 31 March 2004, 15% 2003: 36% of borrowings were due to mature in more than five years, and some 44% 2003: 13% were due to mature within two years.
Foreign currency risk overseas operations give rise to an exposure to currency rates.
Currency exposures arise on the translation of profits earned by overseas investments and on the translation of the net assets of overseas investments.
Profit translation exposures are not usually hedged as they are an accounting rather than cash exposure and the use of average exchange rates to account for currency profits results in a smoothing effect on short term currency movements.
The balance sheet translation exposure is managed primarily by matching currency assets with currency borrowings.
At 31 March 2004 the Group was 98% 2003: 81% hedged on that basis.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 March 2004, after taking account of the interest rate and currency swaps used to manage the interest and currency profile, was: Floating Fixed rate Non-interest Other Total Total rate financial bearing financial financial borrowings borrowings liabilities borrowings 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2003 m m m m m m Currency Sterling GBP 42.6 28.6 1.0 72.2 80.6 US Dollar USD 25.2 37.2 1.1 1.2 64.7 66.7 Canadian Dollar CAD 0.2 0.2 0.2 Euro EUR 5.7 5.7 6.4 Swedish Krona SEK 18.2 18.2 25.8 Total 86.2 71.5 1.1 2.2 161.0 179.7 The floating rate financial liabilities comprise: GBP denominated bank borrowings that bear interest at rates based on one month LIBOR USD denominated bank borrowings that bear interest at rates based on one month US LIBOR SEK denominated bank borrowings that bear interest at rates based on one month Swedish LIBOR CAD denominated bank borrowings that bear interest at rates based on one month CAD LIBOR Finance lease and hire purchase arrangements that bear interest at rates based on UK Base Rate No interest is payable on other financial liabilities.

The USD 20.0m GBP 11.0m cap and collar and USD 20.0m GBP 11.0m fixed rate swap were entered into as hedges against increases in USD interest rates.
Fair values of financial instruments In the table below the fair value of cash, other bank deposits and short term borrowings approximates to book values due to the short maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of long term borrowings has been determined by reference to prices available from the financial markets on which these borrowings are traded.
The fair value is calculated excluding any penalty clauses inherent in the financial instruments and will only crystallise if future interest rates remain at 31 March 2004 levels.
The fair value of the other financial liabilities is not significantly different from the book value.
The fair value of the interest rate and currency swaps is based on the market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.

It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss accounts.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.
In line with the Groups accounting policy, borrowings swapped into other currencies are translated at the contract rates and floating rate interest borrowings swapped into fixed rate borrowings are translated at the contract rates.
Consequently, the carrying value of the relevant borrowing effectively includes the gain or loss on the hedging instrument.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred for the purpose of the table below: Gains Losses Total net gains losses m m m Gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2003 3.2 3.2 Arising in previous years included in 31 March 2004 income 3.2 3.2 Gains and losses not included in 31 March 2004 income Arising in year ended 31 March 2004 0.5 0.5 Gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2004 0.5 0.5 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be included in 31 March 2005 income 0.1 0.1 Gains and losses expected to be included in 31 March 2006 income or thereafter 0.4 0.4 TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 54 55 Notes to the financial statements 31 March 2004 continued 20.

A fee is paid based on the throughput of passengers and cargo.
A commitment to pay a fee of 3m per annum representing the minimum annual concession fee under the terms of the concession agreement is included above.
Pension costs The assets of the defined contribution pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group, under independent administration.
The pension cost charge for these schemes represents contributions payable by the Group to the schemes in the year amounting to some 0.9m 2003: 0.9m.
There are no amounts included in creditors in respect of these pension costs in 2004 or 2003.
The Group operates three defined benefit pension schemes as follows: CIA and BIA The CIA and BIA defined benefit schemes which are closed to new entrants were merged on 30 June 2000 and the combined Scheme is called the TBI Group Final Salary Pension Plan TGFSPP.
The first valuation of the TGFSPP was carried out by the Schemes independent actuary on 30 June 2002.
The Schemes assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and contributions are assessed in accordance with the advice of the Schemes actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the Attained Age Method of Valuation.
Based on the findings of the actuary, the contribution rates were 25.0% with effect from 1 June 2003.
The Groups contributions for the year amounted to some 1.0m 2003: 0.9m.
At the time of the valuation, it was anticipated that this increased contribution rate would remove the deficit in funding over the average expected remaining service lives of the members.
The market value of the assets was some 23.2m at 30 June 2002.
An amount of some 0.1m 2003: 0.1m is included in creditors, being the contributions collected from the employees and CIA and BIA at the year end not yet paid over to the TGFSPP.
TBI Annual report and accounts 2004 27.
Pension costs continued LLAO The Group operates a defined benefit scheme, London Luton Airport Pension Scheme LLAPS, at LLAO.
The LLAPS assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to the LLAPS are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations.
The latest valuation of the LLAPS, prepared as at 31 March 2002, was based on the Projected Unit Method of Valuation.
The market value of its assets at 31 March 2002 was some 19.4m.
The contribution rates at LLAO were 11.9% of pensionable pay from 1 January 2003.
The Groups contributions for the year amounted to some 2.1m 2003: 1.4m.
An amount of some m nil 2003: 0.1m is included in creditors, being contributions collected from the employees and LLAO at the year end not yet paid over to the LLAPS.
TBIAM and AGI As explained in Note 5, there are employees working in AGI and TBIAM whose costs are fully reimbursed by third parties who retain the risks and rewards of employment.
All hourly employees of TBIAM and AGI, including those which are fully reimbursed but excluding those who participate in a union sponsored plan, participate in a defined benefit pension plan.
Contributions to the defined benefit pension plan, TBI US Inc Retirement Plan for Certain Hourly Employees TRPCHE, are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of annual valuations using the Entry Age Normal Cost Method.
At 31 March 2004 the value of the assets of the scheme was some 3.8m US$6.9m 2003: 3.4m US$5.4m.
The Groups contributions for the year amounted to some 0.3m US$0.5m 2003: 0.5m US$0.8m.
The Group has elected to account for defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with FRS 17.
As stated in Note 1 FRS 17 prescribes the basis for valuing defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities.
The prescribed basis for valuing the schemes liabilities differs from the basis used by the schemes actuaries in producing periodic valuations of the schemes.
The main financial assumptions used in the valuation of the pension schemes under FRS 17 are: Assumptions 2004 2004 2003 2003 2002 2002 UK US UK US UK US %%%%%% Inflation 2.8 n a 2.5 n a 2.5 n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.8 n a 3.5 n a 3.5 n a Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.8 n a 2.5 n a 2.5 n a Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.8 n a 2.5 n a 2.5 n a Discount rate 5.5 6.0 5.5 6.5 6.0 7.0 In respect of the US arrangements, the only relevant assumption is the discount rate given the nature of the benefits provided.
As explained in Note 5 there are people working within AGI and TBIAM whose costs are fully reimbursed by third parties.
