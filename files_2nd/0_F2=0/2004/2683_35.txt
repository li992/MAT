2 Historical cost profits and losses There is no difference between the Group results as reported and on the historical cost basis.
Accordingly no additional note of historical cost profits and losses has been prepared.
3 Turnover The Groups operations are all considered to fall into one class of business, namely telecommunications.
4 Segmental information Cable & Wireless is an international telecommunications company.
In the year ended 31 March 2004 the Group was operated on geographic lines.
The UK, European and Japanese businesses provide communications solutions to business and wholesale customers offering IP, data and voice products.
The National Telecommunications companies that are located in the Caribbean, Panama, Macau, the Middle East, South East Asia and in the Pacic, Indian and Atlantic Oceans provided a full range of telecommunications services to both consumer and business customers, including xed and mobile voice, data and IP.
Turnover is reported in the geography in which the services are delivered.
In previous periods revenue was reported in the geography in which customers were managed.
Turnover for 2002 and 2003 has been adjusted to reect where services were delivered.

8 Pensions Dened benefit schemes The Company and its principal subsidiaries operate pension and other retirement schemes that cover the majority of employees of the Group.
These schemes include both the dened benefit type, whereby retirement benets are based on the employees final remuneration and length of service, and dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets reect the accumulated value of agreed contributions paid by, and in respect of, employees.
With the exception of the unfunded, unapproved retirement benefit schemes, the remaining schemes are funded through separate trustee administered schemes.
Contributions to the dened benefit schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries who value the schemes at regular intervals, usually triennially.
An actuarial valuation of the principal United Kingdom dened benefit pension scheme the Scheme was prepared at 31 March 2002 for the purpose of UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The valuation of the Scheme disclosed a shortfall in the market value of the Schemes assets compared with the accrued liabilities.
This was principally due to the fall in the Schemes asset values following the fall in global equity markets between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2002.
Thus, with agreement from the actuary, the Company increased its contributions to the Scheme to 20 per cent of salary with effect from 1 April 2002, and made a one-off contribution to the Scheme of 47 million in December 2002 in respect of the shortfall.
The Scheme was valued using the projected unit method and the principal assumptions were that future investment returns on existing assets would, on average, be 3.2 per cent a year above the level of price ination, that the return on new investments would be 3.9 per cent a year above price ination, that general salary growth would be 1.7 per cent a year above price ination, and that ination related pension increases would generally be in line with price ination.
The market value of the Schemes investments at the valuation date was 1,401 million.
The Scheme also holds some insurance policies, which had an assessed value of 11 million.
The total value of the assets was 97 per cent of the value of the aggregate benets that had accrued to members of the Scheme, allowing for expected future earnings increases in the case of employees.
The assumptions used for calculating the pension cost for accounting purposes differ from the funding assumptions in that the assumed return on existing assets is 3.3 per cent a year above price ination.
In the Financial Statements, the deficit in the Scheme is spread over the remaining service lives of the employed members.
Under those assumptions as at 31 March 2002, the total value of the investments was 99 per cent of the value of the aggregate benets that had accrued to members of the Scheme.
Page 102 notes to the financial statements The principal pension costs as shown in Note 6 comprise: 2004 2003 m m Regular costs 17 22 Variation from regular costs including interest 7 9 24 31 Pension schemes other than the principal scheme are accounted for on the basis of local custom and practice.
Pension prepayments relating to the Scheme of 102 million 2003 112 million, 2002 72 million are included in other debtors Note 20.
Provisions for obligations to pay terminal gratuities on retirement to staff who are not members of the pension and retirement schemes are included in provisions for pensions Note 22.
Dened contribution schemes The pension cost for the year for the dened contribution schemes was 26 million 2003 19 million, 2002 10 million.
Disclosures in respect of FRS17 Retirement benets The above gures have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24.
FRS 17 has been published in the United Kingdom, however, its full introduction has been deferred.
The accounting requirements of FRS 17 are broadly as follows: r pension scheme assets are valued at market values at the balance sheet date: r pension scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality AA corporate bonds of equivalent term and currency to the liability: r for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 the pension scheme surplus to the extent it is considered recoverable or deficit will be recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet: and r the movement in the scheme surplus deficit will be split between operating charges, nancing items and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The transitional disclosures in respect of FRS 17 are set out below: Qualied independent actuaries, Watson Wyatt LLP, updated the actuarial valuations of the major dened benefit schemes operated by the Group to 31 March 2004.
The main financial assumptions in accordance with FRS 17 are as follows: At 31 March At 31 March At 31 March 2004 2003 2002 Rest of Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group UK Group %%%%%% Ination assumption 2.8 3.8 2.5 4.3 2.5 4.9 Rate of increase in salaries 4.6 5.4 4.3 5.6 4.3 6.3 Pension increases 2.8-3.0 3.5 2.5-3.0 3.6 2.5-3.0 3.6 Discount rate 5.5 6.4 5.5 6.9 5.8 7.5 Long term expected rate of return on: Equities 8.0 9.0 8.5 9.1 7.8 9.6 Bonds 5.0 6.6 5.0 7.1 5.5 7.3 Other 4.0 4.8 4.0 4.8 4.5 4.6 Page 103 notes to the financial statements The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The assumptions shown above for the Rest of Group represent a weighted average of the assumptions used for the individual funds.
The UK dened benefit scheme is closed to new entrants and under the projected unit method for closed schemes the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The assets and liabilities of the dened benefit schemes operated by the Group are as follows: At 31 March At 31 March At 31 March 2004 2003 2002 Rest of Rest of Rest of UK Group UK Group UK Group m m m m m m Equities 965 84 855 61 1,130 56 Bonds 353 56 246 56 262 54 Other 90 52 53 36 9 30 Total fair value of scheme assets 1,408 192 1,154 153 1,401 140 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,744 213 1,630 207 1,434 154 deficit in funded dened benefit schemes 336 21 476 54 33 14 deficit in unfunded dened benefit schemes 20 26 18 30 15 14 Total deficit in dened benefit schemes 356 47 494 84 48 28 No material deferred tax asset would be recognised at 31 March 2004 if this liability were reected in the Financial Statements.

These costs include 93 million in respect of redundancy costs in continuing businesses United Kingdom 48 million, Panama 7 million, Caribbean 25 million, Japan 5 million, Other 8 million, 92 million in respect of property costs principally relating to the United Kingdom and 24 million of other costs of restructuring incurred by the UK and European businesses.
Other exceptional costs include 13 million of customer acquisition costs no longer recoverable in light of circumstances that have given rise to certain xed asset impairments.
Page 107 notes to the financial statements Exceptional costs of restructuring the discontinued US business prior to its disposal totalled 22 million principally relating to employee costs.
ii The Group has carried out a review to determine whether there has been an impairment of its xed assets and goodwill.
The carrying values of xed assets of each of the Groups income generating units have been compared with their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
The charge has been determined in accordance with FRS11 Impairment of xed assets and goodwill which involved, amongst other factors, using discount rates of between 10.5 and 20 per cent depending on the cost of capital of the respective businesses.
The result of this assessment was a charge of 10 million in respect of goodwill in Jamaica and 526 million in respect of depreciation of xed assets throughout the Group.
Tax credits of 64 million are available on the National Telecommunications companies depreciation impairment charges.
The depreciation impairment charge arose in the United Kingdom 119 million, Japan 126 million, Caribbean 197 million, Panama 65 million and Macau and the Rest of the World 19 million.
iii On 8 December 2003 the Groups US business led for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection under the US Bankruptcy Code.
The effect of the ling for Chapter 11 together with the sale agreement with Gores was that the Groups ability to control Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. and their subsidiaries CW America was severely restricted.
Accordingly, the Group has deconsolidated Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc. and their subsidiaries from 8 December 2003.
The gain on the exit of the US business of 191 million reects the deconsolidation of third party net liabilities net of costs of exit.
In addition 57 million of accrued costs relating to disposals in previous years, principally the disposal of the consumer operations of Cable & Wireless Communications plc on 30 May 2000, have been released Discontinued 57 million.
A 2 million gain arose on the disposal of certain European businesses after taking account of the release of provisions relating to these businesses.
iv The gain on the disposal of xed assets comprises 16 million relating to the disposal of certain properties in the United States as part of the restructuring of the US business prior to deconsolidation, and 12 million principally comprising disposal of properties in the United Kingdom and the Caribbean as part of restructuring.
Year ended 31 March 2003 v The Group announced a restructuring in the United Kingdom, United States, Japan Asia and Europe on 13 November 2002.
Exceptional costs in the period of 248 million associated with this restructuring include 182 million in respect of property costs, 52 million in respect of redundancy costs and 14 million of other costs.
Other exceptional costs relate to integration costs of Digital Island and the business activities of Exodus of 31 million, redundancy costs of 38 million principally in the Caribbean, Panama and Macau, 44 million of provisions in respect of rentals on vacant properties and 81 million in respect of onerous network contracts and distressed carrier asset write offs.
vi The Group carried out a review to determine whether there had been an impairment of its xed assets and goodwill.
The carrying values of xed assets and goodwill of each of the Groups income generating units was compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
The charge was determined in accordance with FRS 11 which involved, amongst other factors, using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent after five years based on a nominal increase in GDP for the countries in which the Group operates and a discount rate of 14 per cent.
The resulting charge was 12 million in respect of goodwill and 1,479 million in respect of xed assets.
This charge was in addition to the charge of 2,713 million in respect of goodwill and 787 million in respect of xed assets recognised at the half year.
Exceptional depreciation also includes the write-off of redundant xed assets of 58 million.
Tax credits of 48 million were available on 191 million of the impairment charge, which was disclosed in the 2002 Group Financial Statements.
vii The Group has exited its US retail voice business, as announced on 15 May 2002.
The exceptional costs associated with this amount to 288 million and include exit costs of 200 million, redundant xed asset write downs of 57 million Page 108 notes to the financial statements included in the exceptional depreciation charge and other write downs of 31 million.
In addition, 84 million of accrued costs relating to disposals in previous years, principally the disposal of the consumer operations of Cable & Wireless Communications plc on 30 May 2000, have been released Discontinued 204 million.
viii The profit of 62 million on disposal of xed assets principally comprises a 54 million gain on the sale of part of the Groups interest in MobileOne Asia Pte Ltd. ix The current asset investments principally relating to PCCW Limited have been written down by 274 million to market value at 31 March 2003.
The shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust have been written down by 116 million to market value at 31 March 2003.
Year ended 31 March 2002 x Exceptional items included in other operating costs related principally to provisions in respect of ongoing obligations associated with businesses withdrawn from and redundant assets US discontinued operations 6 million, costs associated with the integration of the Web hosting businesses 44 million and redundancy and reorganisation costs incurred 48 million.
xi The Group carried out a review as at 31 March 2002 to determine whether there had been an impairment of its xed assets and goodwill.
The carrying values of xed assets and goodwill of each of the Groups income generating units were compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
In accordance with FRS 11, the value in use of each of the Groups income generating units was determined with reference to the Groups five year projections, which had been approved by the Board, using a growth rate of 2.5 per cent in the period beyond the Groups five year projections based on a nominal increase in GDP for the countries in which the Group operates, and an average discount rate of 11 per cent.
The resulting charge was 2,007 million in respect of goodwill and 1,780 million in respect of xed assets, including 87 million in respect of xed assets in discontinued operations.
In addition, 129 million of xed assets withdrawn from service were written off at 30 September 2001. xii The Group disposed of its interest in Cable & Wireless Optus Limited to Singapore Telecommunications Limited SingTel on 6 September 2001 resulting in a gain of 1,057 million.
The consideration received included shares and bonds issued by SingTel which were converted into cash.
xiii Current asset investments held in ntl Incorporated and CMGI, Inc. were written down to nil value and the investment in PCCW was written down to estimated realisable value.

Full conversion of the bonds would result in an additional 177,733,748 shares being issued.
After 16 July 2007, if Cable & Wireless share price exceeds an amount calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions for a specified number of days, Cable & Wireless has the right to give not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days notice that it will redeem all unconverted bonds still outstanding on a given date at par plus accrued interest.

The deferred tax balance relates to surplus capital allowances of 22 million Company 1 million and other timing differences 3 million Company nil.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
Due to the availability of losses and other reliefs, and the reinvestment of earnings, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
As at 31 March 2004, the Group had tax losses to carry forward of approximately 10.6 billion 2003 6.9 billion.
These principally arise in overseas holding companies where the opportunity to utilise benefit from these losses is considered remote.
Consequently no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of tax losses carried forward.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Included in debtors falling due after more than one year Note 20 are deferred tax debtors of 28 million relating to surplus capital allowances.
ii Pensions The Group operates various unfunded pension plans.
Provision is made for the expected cost of meeting the associated liabilities.
In view of their long term nature, the timing of utilisation of these provisions is uncertain.
Included within this provision is an amount of 12.1 million 2003 4.7 million to cover the cost of former Directors pension entitlements.
Page 122 notes to the financial statements iii Redundancy Provision has been made for the cost of redundancies announced during the year, which are expected to be utilised within 12 months.
iv Property Provision has been made for the lower of the best estimate of the unavoidable lease payments or cost of exit in respect of vacant properties.
Unavoidable lease payments represents the difference between the rentals due and any income expected to be derived from the vacant properties being sub-let.
The provision is expected to be utilised over the shorter of the period to exit and the lease contract life.
v Network Provision has been made for the best estimate of the unavoidable costs associated with redundant network capacity.
vi Other Group Other provisions include amounts relating to the disposal of the US discontinued businesses, which are expected to be utilised within 12 months and amounts relating to specic claims held against the Groups insurance subsidiary.
Page 124 notes to the financial statements The Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust The Cable & Wireless Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust is a discretionary trust which has been funded by loans from the Company to acquire shares in Cable and Wireless plc.
The cost of running the Trust is included in the profit and loss account.
The Trustees of the plan may notionally allocate Ordinary Shares in the Company annually to Executive Directors or other senior executives and other key staff.
Shares are held in trust until such time as they may be transferred to employees in accordance with the terms of the Performance Share Plan, the Restricted Share Plan, the Deferred Short Term Incentive Plan, details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report, and the Share Option Plan, details of which are given below.
The shares will be provided from existing Ordinary Shares in issue acquired by the Trustees.
The expected cost of all these shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the relevant scheme.
Surplus shares may be held to satisfy future awards.
The Trust has waived its rights to dividends.
At 31 March 2004, there were 6,029,721 shares under contingent awards in relation to the Performance Share Plan, 2,017,103 shares under restricted share awards in relation to the Restricted Share Plan, and 5,554,484 shares under options in relation to the Share Option Plan.
Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme Under the Cable & Wireless Savings Related Share Option Scheme SAYE scheme, UK employees can enter a savings contract with a bank to save regular monthly sums of between 5 and 250 for a period of either three or five years.
At the end of the savings contract, the participant receives interest from the bank on their savings.
The savings and the interest may then be used to exercise an option over Ordinary Shares of the Company which are issued at a discount of 20 per cent to the market value of the Companys Ordinary Shares at the date of grant.
The Company has extended the SAYE scheme to its overseas employees by the Cable & Wireless Global Savings Related Share Option Scheme GSAYE scheme.
The GSAYE scheme is offered throughout the Groups territories excluding the United Kingdom and it operates along similar lines to the SAYE scheme with local variances to accommodate local legal and tax considerations.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption contained in UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes not to recognise a charge to the profit and loss account in respect of its Inland Revenue approved SAYE scheme.
Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme and Cable & Wireless Senior Employees Share Option Scheme Prior to July 2001, Cable & Wireless granted share options under the Cable & Wireless Senior Employees Share Option Scheme SESOS and the Cable & Wireless Revenue Approved Share Option Scheme RESOS.
Options awarded under these plans between June 1999 and July 2001 are subject to performance conditions based on Cable & Wireless Total Shareholder Return TSR performance relative to the FTSE 100 Index, underpinned by real growth in EBITDA and turnover.
For full vesting, Cable & Wireless TSR must achieve at least upper quartile level against the FTSE 100 between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Half vesting applies for TSR at the median level, with a sliding scale between median and upper quartile.
If the performance conditions are not met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.
As at the date of this report, no such options have achieved their performance conditions.
Options granted under RESOS and SESOS before June 1999 became exercisable if growth in Companys published earnings per share excluding exceptional items measured over any period of three consecutive financial years, commencing not earlier than the financial year in which the option was granted, exceeded by not less than six per cent the percentage growth of the Retail Price Index over the same three year period.
All such options became exercisable in full.
No further grants will be made under the RESOS and SESOS plans.
Cable & Wireless Share Option Plan The Share Option Plan is the principal vehicle for long-term retention and incentivisation for the Executive Directors, other executives and key staff.
The level of any award is determined by the Remuneration Committee each year by reference to total remuneration within a market peer group, subject to an overriding annual limit of six times salary for the Chief Executive officer and four times salary for other Executive Directors.
The vesting of share options awarded to the Executive Directors and to all employees outside the United States is subject to relative TSR performance conditions.
Full vesting occurs only if the TSR performance of the Company meets or exceeds the Page 125 notes to the financial statements upper quartile between the third and fifth anniversaries of the date of grant.
Where TSR performance meets the median, 50 per cent of the initial award vests.
A sliding scale operates between median and upper quartile, and nothing vests for TSR performance below the median.
If performance conditions have not been met by the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, the options lapse.
With effect from May 2004 the re-testing of performance conditions for share options granted from that date will cease.
If performance conditions for such options have not been met by the third anniversary of the date of grant the option lapses.
Performance conditions are applied in determining the level of awards to employees in the United States, but do not normally apply to the vesting of such awards.
In addition, 25 per cent of awards to employees in the United States vest on the first anniversary of the date of the grant with a further 25 per cent on each subsequent anniversary.
These terms reect normal practice in the United States.
Cable & Wireless Employee Stock Purchase Plan The Company offered employees of its US subsidiaries the Cable & Wireless Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP which was a section 423 qualied plan under the US Internal Revenue Code 1986.
Under the ESPP, employees could save over a one year period sums of between US$10 and US$800 per payroll payment.
At the end of each period the employees had the option to purchase ADRs in the Company at a 15 per cent discount to the market price of an ADR at the date of grant.
Each ADR represents three Ordinary Shares in the Company.
The ESPP was terminated on 30 September 2003.
Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan The Company also offers its employees who are chargeable to income tax, under Section 15 Income Tax Earnings and Pensions Act 2003, the Cable & Wireless Share Purchase Plan the Plan which is a Revenue Approved Share Incentive Plan.
Under the Plan, employees can contribute up to a value of 1,500 or 10 per cent of salary each tax year, whichever is the lower to buy partnership shares in the Company.
Shares are held in a UK resident trust and can be withdrawn from the trust at any time, but there may be pay as you earn taxation and national insurance contributions payable in such events if the shares have not been held in the trust for five years.
Dividends on the partnership shares are reinvested in additional Dividend Shares.

The special reserve relates to the cancellation of share premium account approved by the Company at the 2003 Annual General Meeting and confirmed by the Court in February 2004.
It will be reduced from time to time by the amount of any increase in the paid up share capital and share premium account of the Company after 20 February 2004 resulting from the issue of new shares for cash or other new consideration.
However, the special reserve will not be treated as realised profits of the Company until any debt or claim against the Company outstanding as at 20 February 2004 has been repaid or remedied.
Exchange adjustments in the Group are net of exchange profits of nil 2003 20 million, 2002 27 million on foreign currency borrowings.
The cumulative amount of goodwill charged to reserves in prior years as a result of acquisitions, net of goodwill written back through the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses, amounted to 475 million 2003 475 million, 2002 475 million.
Of this amount 441 million 2003 441 million, 2002 441 million related to joint ventures and associates.
25 Financial instruments An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments is set out under Liquidity and Capital Resources and Disclosures about Market Risk within the Operating and Financial Review.
For the purpose of the disclosures that follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups operations have been excluded from financial assets and liabilities as permitted under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures except for currency risk disclosures.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial Page 127 notes to the financial statements instruments which play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk prole of the Group.
An analysis of the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table on page 131.
Interest rate management The interest rate prole of the financial liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2004, after taking account of interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps, is set out in the table below: NonNonFloating interest Floating interest rate Fixed rate bearing 2004 rate Fixed rate bearing 2003 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 121 653 774 121 667 788 US$ 46 81 127 104 119 449 672 Yen 15 15 74 74 Other 21 3 75 12 169 750 919 232 865 449 1,546 The oating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings bearing interest at rates xed in advance for periods ranging from one week to six months by reference to LIBOR for sterling and US dollar borrowings.
Subject to Cable & Wireless right to make a cash alternative election, each bond entitles the holder to: i convert the conversion amount of such bond into fully paid Ordinary Shares of 25 pence each at the rate of 457.930 Ordinary Shares for each 1,000 held at an initial conversion price of 1.45 per Ordinary Share: and ii to have redeemed the cash settled amount of such bond in accordance with the terms and conditions representing 231.724 Ordinary Shares for each 1,000 held at an initial conversion price of 1.45 per Ordinary Share, at any time prior to 9 July 2010.
After 16 July 2007 if Cable & Wireless share price exceeds an amount calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions for a specified number of days, Cable & Wireless has the right to give not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days notice that it will redeem all unconverted bonds still outstanding on a given date at par plus accrued interest.
If the bonds have not been converted, purchased or redeemed by 16 July 2010, they will be redeemed at par on that date.
The finance cost charged in the profit and loss account comprises the aggregate of the coupon and the proportion of issue costs that relate to the financial year.
The non-interest bearing financial liabilities reported in the prior year comprise 449 million of zero coupon exchangeable bonds, which were exchangeable into ordinary shares of PCCW.
The bonds were issued on 9 April 2001 at 100 per cent of their US$1,504 million principal amount.
Prior to redemption at par on 9 June 2003 the Group purchased US$800 million of the principal amount of the bonds at a discount to their face value.
Page 128 notes to the financial statements The weighted average interest rates for the xed rate financial liabilities of the Group at 31 March 2004, together with the periods for which the rates were xed, are set out in the table below: 2004 2003 Weighted Weighted average average Weighted period for Weighted period for average which rate is average which rate is interest rate xed interest rate xed Currency % Months % Months Sterling 6.9 116 7.9 95 US$ 5.4 76 5.4 82 Yen 3.5 80 3.7 62 Other 10.0 34 10.9 114 6.7 111 7.3 91 The interest and other similar income rate prole of the financial assets of the Group at 31 March 2004, after taking account of interest rate swaps, is set out in the table below: Non-interest Non-interest Floating rate bearing 2004 Floating rate bearing 2003 Currency m m m m m m Sterling 2,178 71 2,249 2,404 87 2,491 US$ 136 6 142 623 11 634 Yen 8 1 9 12 1 13 HK$ 2 17 19 1 254 255 Other 43 3 46 125 5 130 2,367 98 2,465 3,165 358 3,523 The oating rate financial assets principally comprise cash and short term deposits.
Of the total, approximately 92 per cent is held by the Groups central treasury operations as sterling and US dollar cash deposits with short term maturities based on LIBOR and maturities ranging between one and 12 months.
At 31 March 2004, the Group had no financial assets upon which xed income was earned during that year.
The non-interest bearing financial assets are held in the form of shares.
In the prior year the Company purchased 75 million of credit linked notes issued by an AA-rated bank and referenced to the 200 million bond maturing in 2012.
Two notes of 25 million and 50 million were purchased with maturities of September 2003 and July 2004 respectively.
The transactions have a similar economic effect to repurchasing the referenced bonds for the period of the investment.
The notes pay interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 151 basis points.
In return for receiving interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR the final redemption to be received by the Company is determined by certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the Company.
These circumstances arise if there has been a credit event as dened in the terms of the note, in which case the counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value.
A credit event arises in the event of any of the following circumstances in respect of Cable and Wireless plc only: r bankruptcy: r failure to make any payment due under any of its debt obligations, after expiration of any grace period and subject to a threshold of 25 million: and r restructuring of any of its debt subject to a threshold of 25 million.
Page 129 notes to the financial statements If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note is unlikely to be redeemed for cash.
Instead the Company is likely to receive its own bonds or debt obligations with a par value equivalent to that of the credit linked notes in settlement of redemption of the note.
In September 2003 the note of 25 million was redeemed at par.
Exchange risk management The following table shows the Groups currency exposures at 31 March 2004 on currency transactions that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating company involved.
Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities in m 2004 2003 Functional currency of the operating company US$ Sterling Euro Other Total US$ Sterling Euro Other Total Sterling 24 2 26 20 22 24 Yen 2 2 12 3 15 HK$ 3 1 4 33 6 Euro 2 1 1 1 4 1 4 Other 8 9 2 15 26 10 3 9 10 35 8 1 44 16 9 1 9 1 The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of any cross currency swaps, forward exchange contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these currency exposures.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity proles of the Groups financial liabilities, as listed in the fair value table below are disclosed in Note 21.
Borrowing facilities The undrawn committed facilities available at 31 March 2004, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met at that date, were as follows: 2004 2003 m m Expiring within one year 30 Page 130 notes to the financial statements Fair value The estimated fair value of the Groups financial instruments are summarised below: 2004 2003 Carrying Estimated Carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Trade investments 58 111 85 126 Cash 138 138 196 196 Short term deposits 2,217 2,217 2,958 2,958 Current asset investments 12 12 246 246 Loans and obligations under finance leases due within one year 44 44 376 378 Convertible bonds 252 300 449 447 Other loans and obligations under finance leases due after more than one year 623 656 721 681 Other creditors falling due after more than one year 86 86 Derivative financial instruments held to manage interest rate and currency exposure Forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps assets 3 liabilities 1 Cross currency swaps assets 11 liabilities 18 18 16 16 Forward exchange contracts 74 Trade investments Trade investments above are detailed in Note 17 but exclude ESOP shares carried at 41 million 2003 38 million with a fair value of 73 million 2003 38 million.
The fair value is based on year end quoted prices for listed investments and estimates of likely sales proceeds for other investments.
Cash at bank and in hand, short term deposits and short term borrowings The carrying value approximates to fair value either because of the short maturity of the instruments or because the interest rate on investments is reset after periods not greater than six months.
Current asset investments The fair value is based on market value or estimates of likely sales proceeds.
Convertible bonds and other long term debt The fair value is based on quoted market prices or, where these are not available, on the quoted market prices of comparable debt issued by other companies.
Forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate and cross currency swaps is the estimated amount which the Group would expect to pay or receive were it to terminate the swaps at the balance sheet date.
This takes into consideration current interest rates, current exchange rates and the current creditworthiness of the counterparties.
The nominal value of swaps at 31 March 2004 was 131 million 2003 2,146 million.
Forward exchange contracts The value of these contracts is the estimated amount, which the Group would expect to pay or receive on the termination of the contracts.
This takes into consideration current interest rates and current exchange rates.
At 31 March 2004 the Group had 78 million of such contracts outstanding 2003 406 million.
Page 131 notes to the financial statements Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging excluding hedges that have been accounted for by adjusting the carrying value of a xed asset recognised on the balance sheet, and on the underlying asset or liability, are as follows: 2004 2003 Net Net gains gains Gains Losses losses Gains Losses losses m m m m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges At 1 April 3 4 1 88 72 16 Recognised during the year 3 4 1 85 68 17 At 31 March 3 4 1 26 Commitments and contingent liabilities Commitments Capital commitments at the end of the financial year, for which no provision has been made, are as follows: Group Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Contracted 34 135 In addition to the capital commitments above the Group has a number of operating commitments arising in the ordinary course of the Groups business.
The most significant of these relate to network operating and maintenance costs.
In the event of default of another party, the Group may be liable to additional contributions under the terms of the agreements.
Contingent liabilities Contingent liabilities at the end of the financial year for which no disclosure has been made elsewhere in the Financial Statements are as follows: Group Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Trading guarantees 142 181 142 181 Other guarantees 14 353 489 156 181 495 670 Page 132 notes to the financial statements Trading guarantees principally comprise performance bonds or contracts issued in the normal course of business guaranteeing the Group will meet its obligations to complete projects in accordance with the contractual terms and conditions.
The guarantees also enable the customer to obtain repayment of any advance payment in the event of the relevant subsidiary failing to carry out its contractual obligations in full.
Some of these guarantees are uncapped.
The nature of contracts includes projects, service level agreements, installation of equipment, surveys, purchase of equipment and transportation of materials.
The guarantees contain a clause that they will be terminated on final acceptance of work to be done under the contract.
Other guarantees include guarantees in respect of the financial obligations of subsidiary undertakings principally in respect of leases, borrowings and letters of credit.
Pender Insurance Limited Pender, the Groups Isle of Man insurance subsidiary, has written policies in favour of the Group and third parties.
Potentially significant insurance claims have been made against Pender under certain of these third party policies.
Pender is currently taking legal advice and has notied its reinsurers where appropriate.
As certain of the insurance claims have not yet been fully quantied or substantiated by the claimants, it is not currently practicable to estimate their financial effects.
Other matters In addition the Company has given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years as is considered standard practice in such agreements.
Generally, liability has been capped at no more than the value of the sales proceeds, although some uncapped indemnities have been given.
In relation to the sale of CWC ConsumerCo, the Company gave a number of standard warranties and indemnities.
There is no time limit or cap that applies generally.
The Company also gives warranties and indemnities in relation to certain agreements including facility sharing agreements.
Some of these arrangements do not contain liability caps.

Page 135 notes to the financial statements 32 Liquid resources Liquid resources comprise short term deposits, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying value.
Included within liquid resources are amounts totalling 34 million 2003 48 million held by the Groups insurance subsidiary.
These assets are actively managed to meet insurance liabilities.
These assets are required to meet insurance solvency requirements and, as a result, are not all readily available for the general purposes of the Group.
Other short term deposits typically include bank deposits, excluding those which are repayable on demand, commercial paper and government securities.
These deposits have short maturities and a high turnover arising from rollover as part of the Groups treasury management activities.
33 Related party transactions Transactions with joint ventures and associates All transactions with joint ventures and associates arise in the normal course of business.
The aggregate transactions recorded by the Group with joint ventures and associates, which are considered to be material and which have not been disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements, are summarised below: 2004 2003 For the year ended 31 March m m Turnover 1 2 Outpayments 2 4 Dividends received 25 28 Amounts owed by joint ventures and associates are set out in Note 20.

34 Legal proceedings Class action litigation against Cable and Wireless plc Between December 2002 and February 2003, 10 shareholder class action lawsuits were led in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia naming Cable and Wireless plc and several of its ofcers and directors as defendants.
In March 2003, the Court consolidated all of the cases into one action, styled as In re Cable and Wireless plc Securities Litigation, Civil Action No.
In May 2003, the lead plaintiffs led a consolidated complaint that alleged violations of certain sections of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules promulgated thereunder.
A central allegation was that the defendants made false and misleading statements about the Companys financial condition by failing to disclose on a timely basis the existence of a tax indemnity and a ratings trigger to place money in escrow until any liability which the Company may have had under the tax indemnity was nally determined.
The indemnity and ratings trigger appeared in an agreement reached in 1999 between the Company and Deutsche Telekom for the sale of the Companys interest in the mobile telephone company that operated under the name One2One.
In addition to the allegations relating to the tax indemnity, the consolidated complaint also alleged that the defendants made false and misleading statements by: 1 failing to disclose certain lease liability commitments and 2 improperly recognising revenue received from sales of capacity to other carriers.
The plaintiffs sought unspecified money damages in their complaints.
Page 136 notes to the financial statements The Company and related individuals led motions to dismiss the class action complaint, which were heard on 31 October 2003.
On 17 March 2004, the Court issued orders in respect of the motions to dismiss.
The Court orders state in summary that: r the defendants motions including Cable and Wireless plc to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint are granted: r the motion of Sir Ralph Robins, the Companys former chairman, to dismiss the claims against him for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted: and r the defendants alternative motions to dismiss the claims of foreign non-US purchasers for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are denied.
On 5 May 2004, the Court issued a Memorandum Opinion which dealt solely with the motion of Sir Ralph Robins to dismiss.
The Opinion held that the Court has neither specic nor general jurisdiction over Sir Ralph Robins because his contacts with the United States were minimal.
However, the Company is unable to assess the effect of the other orders without a separate Court Memorandum of Opinion setting forth the reasons for these other orders.
The Court has indicated that these Opinions will be forthcoming although no time frame has been set.
If, upon receipt and analysis of the subsequent Court Memoranda of Opinion, the Companys motion to dismiss the class action complaint should prove not to have been completely successful, Cable & Wireless believes that it has meritorious defences to these claims and will continue to vigorously defend itself in this litigation.
Resolution of dispute with IBM UK Limited Disputes between 1 Cable and Wireless plc and IBM United Kingdom Limited, 2 Cable & Wireless USA, Inc. and International Business Machines Corporation and 3 IBM Japan Limited and Cable & Wireless IDC Incorporated collectively Cable & Wireless and IBM respectively arose out of a Global Framework Agreement GFA dated 20 December 2000, and related agreements, pursuant to which IBM agreed to supply to Cable & Wireless information technology services.
On 8 September 2003, an amicable resolution of the matters in dispute was agreed upon by Cable & Wireless and IBM the terms of which are condential following which, by consent, Cable & Wireless and IBM entered a Tomlin Order at the High Court of England and Wales.
The effect of that order was to stay the legal proceedings, which existed between Cable & Wireless and IBM in relation to the disputes.
On 31 December 2003, the terms of the GFA expired Cable & Wireless having given notice to terminate the same in June 2003 and in January 2004, all services previously provided by IBM under the terms of the GFA were insourced back to Cable & Wireless.
Class action securities litigation against Digital Island, Inc. Cable & Wireless and others Digital Island Inc. Digital Island, Cable and Wireless plc, Dali Acquisition Corp. Dali a former subsidiary of Cable & Wireless which subsequently merged with Digital Island to form Cable & Wireless Internet Services, Inc., and certain of the then present and former directors of Digital Island, were named as defendants in six separate putative class action lawsuits alleging various claims arising out of Cable & Wireless acquisition of Digital Island in August 2001.
Three of the lawsuits were led in the US District Court for the District of Delaware and three were led in the Delaware Court of Chancery.
The three federal lawsuits were consolidated into a single case.
The federal suit alleged that the defendants violated federal securities laws by failing to disclose on a timely basis that Digital Island had entered into certain business agreements with Bloomberg, L. P. and Major League Baseball.
It further alleged that compensation agreements with certain ofcers and or directors of the company violated the federal securities all-holders rule.
One state lawsuit alleged violations of Delaware law based upon similar allegations.
The other two state lawsuits alleged various violations of Delaware law against the same corporate defendants and the present and former Digital Island directors, including that they failed to disclose all material facts relating to Digital Islands relationship with Microsoft, and that they failed to obtain a fair price for Digital Island shares.
Page 137 notes to the financial statements On 10 September 2002, a federal District Court granted the defendants motion to dismiss the federal lawsuits with prejudice.
Plaintiffs appealed the decision to the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
On 6 February 2004, the US Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the decision of the federal District Court that the lawsuits be dismissed.
This decision is final as to Cable and Wireless plc.
Litigation with Cibertec Internacional, S. A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S. A. Cibertec Internacional, S. A. and Inversiones Kamasu, S. A. initiated proceedings against Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. and Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited in Panama on 29 October 1999.
The claim was for approximately US$125 million and alleged breach of contract.
On 18 December 2002, the Civil Circuit Judge of the First Judicial Circuit of Panama handed down a decision against Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. awarding damages of US$67,255,000, including moral damages and costs.
The judge dismissed the complaint against Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited.
Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. subsequently appealed the judgment on 3 December 2002 and the parties settled the case on 28 October 2003.
The settlement was approved by the First Superior Court of Panama on 6 November 2003.
Under the terms of the settlement, Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. did not accept or recognise any liability to the plaintiffs but voluntarily agreed to make a payment of US$14.5 million to the plaintiffs.
The plaintiffs have waived all claims in this matter against Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. and Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited.
Claim against the Minister of Finance and Economy, Panama On 16 December 2002, a complaint was led by two Panamanian lawyers exercising a public action at the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama questioning the law governing and rules of Public Bid No.
06 96 won by INTEL, S. A. now Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A..
Complaints led at the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court of Justice must be led against the public officer who enacted the relevant regulation of act.
This complaint was led against the Minister of Finance and Economy in Panama specically alleging that the Operating Agreement executed between Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited and INTEL, S. A. now Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. as part of the privatisation agreements was null and void ab initio, on the grounds that it had not been published in the Ofcial Gazette in Panama.
The Operating Agreement enables Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. to use the technical and management know-how of Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited to more effectively full its obligations under the concession granted to it by the Government of Panama to install, operate and exploit telecommunication services in Panama.
Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. due to its close interest in the outcome of the complaint requested recognition by the Court and permission to participate in the proceedings.
On 21 March 2003, the Court permitted the claim to proceed.
Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. led an appeal against the admission of the claim to proceed, however the Court confirmed its decision to permit the claim to proceed on 17 March 2004.
As required by Panamanian law, the Administrations General Attorney has provided an opinion to the Court in defence of the law or regulation which is the subject of the complaint.
The Administrations General Attorney has opined that the Operating Agreement complied with all the requirements established by the law and by the rules of Public Bid No.
06 96 and was countersigned by the General Comptroller acting with due authorisation.
Panamanian counsel consider this claim to be without merit and none of Cable and Wireless plc, Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. or Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited is party to the complaint.
However, if the complaint were to be successful, the concession under which Cable & Wireless Panama, S. A. operates will not be affected, however the Operating Agreement could be declared null and void and then the complainants could le a complaint against Cable and Wireless CALA Management Services Limited requiring the return of all management fees collected under the agreement since its execution on 20 May 1997.
This would amount to approximately 60 million.
In the event that this complaint is successful, Cable & Wireless and its subsidiaries intend to vigorously pursue any legal recourse available to them.
Page 138 notes to the financial statements Claim by Caribtel Caribbean Limited On 9 May 2003, Caribtel Caribbean Limited, a telecommunications operator specialising in calling cards, led a suit against Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in the Supreme Court of Judicature of Jamaica.
Caribtel has alleged that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited wrongfully disconnected Caribtels local access telephone services, resulting in a breach of contract and a violation of the Jamaican Fair Competition Act and the Telecommunications Act.
Caribtel is claiming US$50 million of lost income to its pre-paid local access calling card business for the period from 25 April 2003 to 25 April 2006.
Caribtel has also claimed aggravated and or exemplary damages of Jamaica $300 million and is seeking injunctive relief to require Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited to reinstate Caribtels local access telephone service.
On 22 May 2003, Caribtel presented a petition for injunctive relief before the Supreme Court of Jamaica requesting that Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited be required to reinstate Caribtels local access telephone service: be restrained from disconnecting any other telecommunications facility currently supplied to Caribtels business premises until trial: and be prevented from calling on a prior bank guarantee that Caribtel had provided to Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited in conjunction with a settlement agreement entered into between the parties in February 2003 relating to breaches of contract by Caribtel in December 2002.
The injunctions were not granted by the Court.
However, Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited gave an undertaking that it would not disconnect the direct internet access facility pending a hearing scheduled for 2 June 2003.
Prior to the hearing of 2 June 2003, Caribtel approached Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited with a view to arriving at a settlement.
The parties entered into negotiations as a result of which the matter was taken off the Court list by consent of both parties.
Once an indirect access product had been nalised and approved by the Ofce of Utilities Regulation in Jamaica, a settlement agreement was executed between Caribtel and Cable & Wireless Jamaica Limited on 30 July 2003.
