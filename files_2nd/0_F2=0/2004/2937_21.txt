Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements, except in respect of the matter noted below.
The Group owns shares in Carillion plc via its Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust.
The purpose of this trust is to hold shares that may subsequently be awarded to Executive Directors and senior employees under share incentive schemes.
In previous years the purchase cost of these shares were treated as fixed asset investments.
During the year, the Group adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
The effect of this has been to recognise the purchase cost of the shares as a deduction in shareholders funds rather than as a fixed asset investment.
For 2003 the impact of this change is to reduce both fixed asset investments and the profit and loss reserve by 6.2m for the Group and Company.
In the cash flow statement movements associated with the ESOP trust have been reclassified from capital expenditure and financial investment to financing.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets comprising land and buildings, and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries drawn up to 31 December 2004.
Unless otherwise stated the acquisition method of accounting has been applied.
Under this method acquired subsidiaries are included from the date of acquisition.
Disposals are accounted for up to the date control passes to a third party.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Groups share of the profits less losses of joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and its interest in their net assets other than goodwill is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheet.
Where a Group company is party to a joint arrangement that is not an entity, that company accounts directly for its share of the income and expenditure, assets, liabilities and cash flows.
Such arrangements are reported in the consolidated financial statements on the same basis.
Profit recognition Profit on long term contracts is calculated in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In determining the attributable profit on contracts to a particular accounting period the Group utilises estimation techniques.
The principal estimation technique used is the preparation of profit and cash flow forecasts on a contract-by-contract basis which enables an assessment to be made of the final out-turn on each contract.
Profit is then recognised when the outcome of the contract can be foreseen with reasonable certainty and is attributed in line with the degree of completion of each contract.
The result for each year includes settlement of claims on contracts completed in prior years.
In preparing contract forecasts, a prudent and reasonable evaluation of claims is included in the assessment of the final out-turn.
Property development profits are recognised once the contract for sale becomes unconditional.
Group turnover Group turnover represents the fair value of consideration receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied to external customers.
In respect of long term contracting activities, turnover reflects the fair value of work executed during each year.
It also includes the Groups proportion of work carried out under joint arrangements during the year.
Interest Interest is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred by all subsidiaries in the Group.
Interest incurred on borrowings within the Groups joint ventures relating to the construction of assets in PPP projects is capitalised until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the result for each year and takes into account deferred taxation.
Deferred tax assets or liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computation that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.
Liabilities are calculated on a non-discounted full provision basis.
Assets are calculated on the same basis, but are recognised only to the extent that is it probable that they will be recovered.
47 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Financial Statements 06 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 1 Principal accounting policies continued Tangible fixed assets The Group has continued to follow the transitional provisions of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets to retain the book value of freehold land and buildings, which were last revalued in 1985.
Depreciation is based on historical cost or revaluation, less the estimated residual values, and the estimated economic lives of the assets concerned.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other tangible assets are depreciated in equal annual instalments over the period of their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold land and buildings 50 years Short leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Plant, machinery and vehicles 3-10 years Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions, being the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the identifiable net assets of an acquired company or business, including an interest in a joint venture, is capitalised and amortised in equal annual instalments over its useful economic life.
Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off to reserves on acquisition.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, this treatment has continued to be applied for those years.
Any such goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in the calculation of any profit or loss on disposal in respect of businesses subsequently disposed of or terminated.
Any impairment arising on goodwill that has previously been written off to reserves is taken to the profit and loss account.
Fixed asset investments In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost, less provision for any impairment.
Stocks Stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Long term contract balances Amounts recoverable on contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at cost plus attributable profit less any provision for foreseeable losses.
Payments received on account of contracts are deducted from amounts recoverable on contracts in debtors or long term contract balances in stock.
Where such amounts have been received and exceed amounts recoverable, the net amounts are included in creditors.
Pre-contract costs Pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until the Group is appointed preferred bidder.
Provided the contract is expected to generate sufficient net cash inflows to enable recovery and the award of the contract is virtually certain, pre-contract costs incurred post the appointment as preferred bidder are included in stocks.
Where pre-contract bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are initially applied against the asset included in stocks.
Recoveries of costs in excess of the amounts carried in stocks are carried forward as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract to which the pre-contract costs relate.
Own shares Company shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trust are presented in both the Group and Company financial statements as a deduction in shareholders funds until such time as the interest in the shares is transferred unconditionally to the employees.
Costs of administering the trust are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The ESOP trust is regarded as a quasi subsidiary under FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions and its assets, liabilities and results are consolidated into the financial statements of both the Company and the Group.
Leased assets Operating lease rental charges are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of each lease.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are included in tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the contract term or their useful life.
The capital element of outstanding finance leases and hire purchase contracts is included in creditors.
The finance charge element of rentals is charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligations.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling and recorded using the contracted exchange rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at the relevant balance sheet date and the gains and losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The profit and loss accounts and balance sheets of overseas undertakings and joint ventures are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year.
Gains or losses arising on the translation of the opening net assets of such overseas undertakings are taken to reserves together with exchange differences on related foreign currency hedges.
48 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Financial Statements 06 1 Principal accounting policies continued Share incentive schemes Where share incentives are granted with an exercise price of less than the market price at the date of grant the difference is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to the exercisable date of the incentives.
Due regard is made to the likelihood of the stipulated performance criteria being attained with the charge being amended accordingly.
No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all or substantially all employees as permitted by UITF 17 revised Employee share schemes.
Pensions Pension costs are recognised in the financial statements in accordance with the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
Regular pension costs in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are established in accordance with the recommendations of independent actuaries and are charged to the profit and loss account based on the expected pension costs over the employees service lives with the Group.
Current actuarial surpluses or deficits are amortised over the average expected remaining service lives of current employees on a systematic basis.
The difference between the amounts charged or credited to the profit and loss account and the contributions made to the pension schemes is included within debtors or creditors as appropriate.
Contributions to the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
The Group continues to follow the transitional provisions as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 which are disclosed in Note 30.

The actual tax rate differs from the standard rate for the reasons set out below: 2004 2003 m m Loss profit on ordinary activities before taxation 6.4 23.8 Taxation at UK standard rate of corporation tax 1.9 7.1 Permanent differences 2.3 3.3 Other timing differences 4.6 5.8 Other timing differences not recognised 1.8 Overseas profits not taxable 0.7 0.7 Utilisation of overseas losses not previously recognised 0.9 0.9 Unrelieved trade losses in the year 0.6 1.3 Capital items not taxable including write back of goodwill 15.5 3.5 Amortisation and impairment of goodwill 0.7 10.6 Adjustment in respect of previous periods 4.0 2.6 Current taxation charge for the year 16.2 15.8 c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has brought forward UK tax losses in excess of 61m.
In accordance with FRS 19, a deferred tax asset, valued in excess of 18m, has not been recognised in respect of these losses due to the lack of certainty regarding quantum and timing of future years taxable profits in the companies involved.
In the event that such profits are realised this may result in the Group tax rate being lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The tax rate in the joint venture companies in which the Group has PPP investments may be greater than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
This is generally due to capital expenditure not qualifying for tax relief.
As the PPP element of the Groups profit before taxation increases in future years it will have the effect of increasing the Groups tax rate above the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
This may be offset by the developing trend for composite trade tax treatment whereby all income and expenditure is treated as on trading account for tax purposes.
9 Profit for the financial year In accordance with Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The profit for the financial year of the Company is 63.1m 2003: 27.7m.

In the Company, net obligations due under finance leases relate to financing agreements for fixed assets that are used by Carillion Construction Limited and Carillion Fleet Management Limited, both wholly owned subsidiaries.
The assets have been recognised in the accounts of the subsidiaries in accordance with SSAP 21 Accounting for leases and hire purchase contracts, together with corresponding liabilities to Carillion plc.
Carillion plc recognises these inter company debts within amounts owed by Group undertakings in Note 17.
Interest is charged on the above bank loans at floating rates linked to LIBOR.
All bank loans and overdrafts are unsecured.
Other loans and net obligations due under finance leases are secured on the assets to which they relate.
The maturity profile of all borrowings is disclosed in Note 21.
59 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Financial Statements 06 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 21 Financial instruments and risk management The main purpose of the Groups financial instruments is to provide finance for its operations.
The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, include bank loans and overdrafts, cash and short term deposits, and finance leases.
In addition, various financial instruments, for example trade debtors and trade creditors, arise directly from the Groups operations.
The Groups derivative transactions relate solely to forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Groups policies with regard to financial instruments have remained unchanged throughout the year.
The Groups treasury department manages the main financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board.
These are discussed in detail below and in the Operating and Financial Review on page 19 and are designed to reduce the financial risks affecting the Group.
The Groups treasury department does not enter into speculative financial transactions.
The Groups main financial risks are funding and liquidity risk, interest rate risk and currency risk.
Funding and liquidity The financial assets and liabilities of the Group may be summarised as follows: 2004 2003 Weighted Weighted average average period until period until maturity of maturity of Assets Liabilities liabilities Assets Liabilities liabilities m m Years m m Years Nil coupon: Sterling 0.1 3.3 2.8 0.7 3.1 2.6 Canadian dollars 9.5 0.4 2.0 8.5 Omani rials 5.0 2.6 1.5 3.0 1.6 1.5 European currencies 0.6 Other 0.1 14.7 6.3 2.2 12.8 4.7 2.2 Floating rate: Sterling 190.2 97.6 0.8 Canadian dollars 4.2 17.8 6.5 16.9 United States of America dollars 2.2 13.1 1.3 9.7 Omani rials 1.0 4.0 European currencies 4.5 15.0 17.4 23.3 Other 1.2 1.2 203.3 45.9 128.0 50.7 Fixed rate: Sterling 16.7 15.8 Canadian dollars 11.3 1.3 European currencies 0.1 28.0 17.2 Total 218.0 80.2 140.8 72.6 Summary by currency: Sterling 190.3 20.0 98.3 19.7 Canadian dollars 13.7 29.5 15.0 18.2 United States of America dollars 2.2 13.1 1.3 9.7 Omani rials 6.0 2.6 European currencies 4.5 15.0 18.0 19.7 Other 1.3 8.2 5.3 Total 218.0 80.2 140.8 72.6 The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate financial liabilities is 5.3 per cent 2003: 5.4 per cent.
The weighted average period for which this interest is fixed is 6.7 years 2003: 7.4 years.
The Groups financial assets, which exclude short term debtors and pension prepayments, consist primarily of cash at bank and on deposit that earn interest at money market related rates.
The financial assets on which no interest is earned are primarily trade debtors and amounts recoverable on contracts that are expected to be received in more than one year.
60 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Financial Statements 06 21 Financial instruments and risk management continued The Groups financial liabilities exclude short term creditors and deferred income relating to PPP bid cost recoveries.
Floating rate financial liabilities comprise bank borrowings that bear interest based on money market or base rate related interest rates.
Fixed rate financial liabilities comprise other loans and finance lease and hire purchase contract liabilities.
The Groups consolidated cash position at the balance sheet date is not representative of the position at other times of the year.
Whilst material working capital movements and the resultant cash flows are a significant feature of the Groups cash profile throughout the year, a number of factors combine to exaggerate the year end position.
Such factors include a reduction in the demand for working capital over the extended holiday period, shorter daylight and therefore working hours and a traditional industry focus on the settlement of contractual claims.
Interest rate risk The Groups bank debt is predominantly currency borrowings for hedging against overseas investments and local overseas borrowings related to working capital requirements.
These borrowings are subject to floating rate interest charges.
Non-bank debt is predominantly finance leases in the UK and Canada that are subject to fixed rates.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken.
Currency exposure The Group has small and infrequent transactional currency exposures.
Group policy requires net exposures to be hedged using appropriate hedging techniques as soon as a contractual commitment is made.
The Groups policy on hedging currency net assets is to hedge, where practical, at least 60 per cent of the net asset value of overseas investments where such net assets exceed 10m equivalent.
Throughout the year hedging was achieved through currency borrowings and forward contracts.
There were no material unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for exchange rate hedging either during or at the end of the year.
At 31 December 2004 the total sterling value of currency borrowings for the purposes of hedging was 32.8m 2003: 39.4m.

Credit risk and exposures The Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Credit exposures on financial instruments arise through short term deposits and foreign exchange hedging.
Such transactions are authorised to be executed only with highly credit-rated counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly.
Fair values The book and fair values of the Groups financial instruments at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 are not materially different.

30 Pension arrangements Carillion operates a number of pension schemes in the United Kingdom for eligible employees.
The main defined benefit schemes are: The Carillion Staff Pension Scheme: The Carillion B Pension Scheme: The Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme: Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme relating to GTRM and Centrac.
The key actuarial assumptions used in the latest valuations of these schemes were: Public Railways Staff B Sector Pension Rate of increase in salaries 4.35% 5.35% 4.35% 4.75% Rate of increase in pensions 2.35% 2.35% 2.35% 2.50% Inflation rate 2.35% 2.35% 2.35% 2.50% Discount rate 5.50% 5.50% 6.00% 5.61% All the main defined benefit schemes in the United Kingdom were fully funded on the prescribed Minimum Funding Requirement MFR basis.
66 Carillion plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Financial Statements 06 30 Pension arrangements continued Carillion Staff and B Pension Schemes Actuarial valuations of the above schemes were undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 31 December 2002 using the projected unit method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date were 316.7m and 80.9m respectively, which represented approximately 81 per cent and 90 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 13.5m 2003: 13.9m in respect of the Carillion Staff Pension Scheme and 1.6m 2003: 1.8m in respect of the Carillion B Pension scheme.
Both schemes are closed to new entrants.
The contribution rates include an allowance for funding the past service deficits identified at the 2002 valuation date over the remaining average working life of the active scheme members.
The contribution rates will normally be reviewed at the next valuation due at 31 December 2005.
Carillion Public Sector Pension Scheme An actuarial valuation of the scheme was undertaken by the Trustees independent actuaries as at 31 December 2002 using the attained age method.
The market value of the schemes assets at that date was 58.2m, which represented approximately 90 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for future increases in salaries.
The contributions paid during the year were 1.8m 2003: 2.2m.
The scheme remains open to eligible employees transferring from the public sector as part of the commercial obligations under PFI, PPP and Best Value contracts with public sector employers.
The contribution rates will be reviewed after the next valuation at 31 December 2004.
Following the transfer of the Metropolitan Police Authority contract during the year, there is expected to be a bulk transfer of members and the associated assets and liabilities to the incoming service provider during 2005.
As the process has not yet been completed, no assessment of the effect of any transfer can be made at the current time.
Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme Employees of GTRM and Centrac, and former employees of British Rail who transferred to these businesses, have pension provision via Shared Cost Sections of the Railways Pension Scheme.
Both the GTRM and Centrac Sections are closed to new entrants.
Shared cost arrangements are such that the employer and members share the cost of future service liabilities on a 60 40 split respectively and any surplus or deficit emerging over time is dealt with on a similar basis.
The contributions paid by the employer during the year were 4.5m 2003: 4.9m for GTRM and 0.6m 2003: 0.1m for Centrac.
Independent actuaries appointed by the Railways Pension Trustee Company Limited carried out a formal valuation of the Railways Pension Scheme at 31 December 2001 using the projected unit method for GTRM and the attained age method for Centrac.
The next full valuation is due as at 31 December 2004.
The market value of the scheme assets of the GTRM Section and Centrac Section at 31 December 2001 were 263.4m and 26.1m respectively, which represented 108 per cent and 115 per cent of benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after taking account of future increases in salaries.
Following the transfer of rail maintenance contracts to Network Rail there is expected to be a bulk transfer of members and the associated assets and liabilities to the Network Rail Shared Cost Section of the Railways Pension Scheme during 2005.
As the basis of the transfer has not yet been agreed with Network Rail, no assessment of the effect on the assets and liabilities of the scheme can be made at the current time.
Other UK and overseas schemes The Group operates two UK defined contribution schemes, the Carillion Pension Plan and the Carillion Retirement Plan closed to new entrants since 2001.
The Carillion Pension Plan commenced on 1 April 2003.
The majority of new employees are eligible to join this Plan.
Employees contribute a minimum of 5 per cent and the employer a minimum of 7 per cent of basic salaries.
Up to 3 per cent of any additional voluntary contributions paid by employees is matched by the employer resulting in a maximum employer contribution of 10 per cent of basic salary.
Death in service lump sum benefits are provided in addition.
Contributions during the year were 0.7m 2003: 0.1m.
Employees of Carillion Services Limited who are not eligible for the Carillion Pension Plan are invited to participate in the Carillion Stakeholder Plus managed by Merrill Lynch Pensions Limited.
Employees contribute 5 per cent and the employer 6.5 per cent of basic salary.
Contributions during the year were 0.5m 2003: 1.0m.
Stakeholder pensions are also provided by B&CE Insurance and Scottish Widows where required by Working Rule Agreements.
Carillion Construction Limited is an admitted body in the Surrey Pension Fund, Hertfordshire Pension Fund and the Warwickshire Pension Fund.
All sections were granted a fully funded past service position and employer contributions are paid in accordance with the actuarys recommendations.
The contributions and investment returns are estimated to be sufficient to maintain the fully funded past service position at 31 December 2004.
Contributions during the year, which have been accounted for on a defined contribution basis, were 0.3m 2003: Nil.

SSAP 24 pension costs Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs requires that the cost of providing pensions is recognised over the period benefiting from the employees services, with any differences between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the schemes being shown as an asset or liability on the balance sheet.
The pension cost has been determined by the Directors in conjunction with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the assumptions below: Public Railways Staff B Sector Pension Rate of increase in salaries 4.50% 5.50% 4.50% 4.50% Rate of increase in pensions 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Inflation rate 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Discount rate 6.00% 6.00% 6.00% 6.50% The SSAP 24 position for the UK schemes at 1 January 2004 is as follows: Public Railways Staff B Sector Pension Market value of assets m 375.3 90.8 68.9 291.5 Level of funding % 92.0 102.0 92.0 106.2 The charge to the profit and loss account for 2004, as disclosed in Note 6, is analysed as follows: Defined Public Railways contribution Staff B Sector Pension plans Total m m m m m m Regular cost 9.5 1.2 1.6 6.0 2.2 20.5 Variation in cost 2.4 0.1 0.5 0.2 3.0 Interest credit 0.3 0.1 0.8 1.2 Net pension cost 11.6 1.0 2.1 5.4 2.2 22.3 Pension prepayment written off 7.2 Total pension cost 29.5 The pension prepayment written off of 7.2m is in relation to those employees that transferred to Network Rail during the year.
Amounts carried in the balance sheet in respect of pension prepayments are disclosed in Note 17.
FRS 17 retirement benefits Group Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24, under FRS 17 Retirement benefits the following transitional disclosures are required.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in providing the FRS 17 position were: 31 December 2004 31 December 2003 31 December 2002 UK Canada UK Canada UK Canada Rate of increase in salaries 4.00% 3.25% 4.06% 3.25% 3.58% 3.50% Rate of increase in pensions 2.75% 2.25% 2.81% 2.25% 2.33% 2.50% Inflation rate 2.75% 2.25% 2.81% 2.25% 2.33% 2.50% Discount rate 5.30% 6.00% 5.36% 6.00% 5.50% 6.25% The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.

Hence, as permitted by FRS 17, the schemes are accounted for by the Company separately as if the schemes were defined contribution schemes.
31 Transfer of rail contracts to Network Rail In May 2004 a contractual agreement was reached with Network Rail to transfer the assets and undertakings relating to the Groups five rail maintenance contracts.
Two contracts transferred on 29 May 2004 and the remaining three transferred on 24 July 2004.
The assets transferred consisted primarily of plant, equipment, consumables and stocks.
In addition, the Group wrote off a prepayment of pension contributions relating to transferring employees of 7.2m.
The book value of assets at the date of the agreement was 13.8m.
A profit of 2.9m arose on the transfer of tangible fixed assets as disclosed in Note 3.
Other terms of the transfer agreement, which are subject to a confidentiality undertaking with Network Rail, dealt with the settlement of contract claims in the normal course of business, the costs of transfer and the separation terms.
