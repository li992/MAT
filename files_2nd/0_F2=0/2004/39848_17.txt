qxd 13 12 04 9:59 am Page 22 Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting Policies Basis of Accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The historical cost basis of accounting has been used with the exception of investment properties which are stated at revalued amounts in accordance with SSAP19 Accounting for Investment Properties and which requires a departure from the requirements of the 1985 Companies Act relating to depreciation and amortisation as explained below.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the audited financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to the balance sheet date.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented for the Company.
Investments in subsidiaries are stated in the Companys balance sheet based at their net asset value.
Investment Properties Investment properties are revalued annually by external professional valuers on an open market basis.
Any surplus or temporary deficit arising on the revaluation of investment properties is transferred to the revaluation reserve.
Permanent diminutions in value below cost are charged in the profit and loss account.
Additions to properties include costs of a capital nature only.
All other property expenditure is written off in the profit and loss account as incurred.
No finance costs are capitalised.
Where refurbishment projects are in progress or are valued as completed at the balance sheet date, the costs to be incurred in completing such projects are accrued in full, to the extent they are contractually committed, in the financial statements.
Amounts received by way of dilapidations from tenants vacating properties are credited against the cost of reinstatement works.
Where the company has no intention of carrying out such works, the amounts received are credited to the profit and loss account.
Purchases and Sales of Investment Properties Purchases and sales of investment properties are recognised in the financial statements on the date at which there is a legally binding and unconditional contract.
On the disposal of an investment property the surplus or deficit is calculated by reference to the book value at the date of sale and included in the profit and loss account.
Depreciation and Amortisation of Properties In accordance with SSAP 19, no provision is made for depreciation of freehold properties or amortisation of leasehold properties with over 20 years unexpired.
The Companies Act 1985 requires all properties to be depreciated which conflicts with the generally accepted accounting principle, set out in SSAP 19.
The Directors consider that, as these properties are held for long term investment and are revalued annually, to depreciate them would not give a true and fair view and it is necessary to adopt SSAP19 in order to give a true and fair view.
It is not practicable to quantify the depreciation or amortisation which might otherwise have been charged.
Depreciation of Other Assets Depreciation is provided on short leasehold office premises, equipment and motor vehicles to write their cost down to their estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives at the following rates: Short leasehold office premises - over the period of the lease on cost, assuming no residual value Equipment - 20% 25% per annum on cost Motor vehicles - 25% per annum on written down value Turnover Turnover now includes rents invoiced to tenants, rents accrued in accordance with UITF28 and recoverable expenses incurred on behalf of tenants.
Value Added Tax is excluded from all amounts.
The Company has adopted the guidance set out in Application Note G to FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions issued by the Accounting Standards Board in November 2003.
Income arising from the recovery of expenses incurred on behalf of tenants, principally service charges and insurance, is now reported as part of the Companys turnover in accordance with this new guidance.
Previously these recoverable amounts were included within property charges as a credit against expenditure incurred.
This change in disclosure has no effect on reported net property revenue or profit on ordinary activities.
The effect on reported turnover and other property expenses is as follows: 46 Shaftesbury Back Section.

Any premium arising on the issue of long term debt is added to the proceeds and credited to the profit and loss account over the life of the debt instrument.
The costs of organising long and medium term bank facilities are written off in the profit and loss account over the term of the facilities.
Financial Instruments Amounts receivable or payable under the terms of interest rate hedging agreements are accrued over the period to which they relate and are credited or charged to interest payable in the profit and loss account.
Deferred Taxation Deferred tax is provided in respect of all temporary timing differences arising from the differing treatment of certain expenditure for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not provided in respect of the corporation tax liability which could arise in the event of realisation of investment properties at the values stated in the financial statements.
Deferred tax liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets are recognised when recoverability is considered reasonably certain.

The fair value of the LIBOR-linked loans are based on the LIBOR rate that would have been secured had the loans been drawn on the last day of the financial year.
The fair value of interest rate hedging agreements represents the net present value of the difference between the contracted fixed rates payable and the rates that could have been secured if those agreements were entered into on the last day of the financial year.
Information regarding interest and hedging rates was obtained from external sources.
The Company does not intend to redeem its Mortgage Debenture Stock in advance of its redemption date of 31st March 2024, when repayment will be at par value of 132,000,000.
Amounts payable or receivable under the Companys hedging arrangements will be dealt with in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
LIBOR-linked loans will be redrawn on maturity at interest rates prevailing at that time.
