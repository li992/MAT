The unrecognised deferred tax asset of 29.9 million 2003 32.4 million above relates primarily to overseas tax losses where there is insufficient certainty that these losses will be utilised in the immediate future.
ii No deferred tax has been provided on revalued assets due to the availability of realised capital losses for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
iii There are additional unprovided capital losses carried forward which have not yet been agreed with the Inland Revenue.
iv The Group is able to obtain tax relief in some overseas territories for the cost of goodwill arising on its acquisitions of some businesses.
In certain cases the goodwill was written off to reserves under the transitional rules set out in FRS 10.
Utilisation of the available tax relief in the overseas territories gives rise to a timing difference as set out above.
The potential timing differences will only reverse on sale of the relevant businesses.
As the relevant businesses are considered core to the Group there is currently no intention to dispose of them.
The potential reversal is so far into the future that after discounting, the potential liability becomes insignificant.
The effect of discounting the Groups accelerated capital allowances is a credit of 3.2 million 2003 4.1 million.
The effect of discounting the Groups other deferred tax assets and liabilities is not material.

The writs were served on Euromoney in October, 1996.
The total amount claimed is 280 million Malaysian ringgits, 40.7 million 2003 50.0 million.

39 Pension Arrangements The Group operates several pension schemes covering most major UK group companies under which contributions are paid by the employer and employees.
The schemes for most employees are funded defined benefit pension arrangements, providing service-related benefits, based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the schemes are held independently from the Groups finances and are administered by trustee companies.
Pension costs are assessed on the advice of an independent qualified actuary following triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
A valuation of the principal schemes was carried out as at 31st March, 2001 and the long term assumptions having the most significant effect on the pension costs reported under SSAP24 are shown in the following table: Price Inflation 2.5% p. a.
The surpluses or deficits identified from the valuation of the principal schemes are amortised over a period of eleven years using the straight line method.
The results of the triennial valuation of the principal schemes as at 31st March, 2004 have not yet been finalised.
However, interim valuations carried out as at 31st March of each year have highlighted the impact on the schemes of changing market conditions and falling investment returns.
As a result, the Company agreed with the Trustees to increase cash contributions to the principal schemes from 12% to 15% of pensionable salaries from 1st October, 2003.
Additionally, pending completion of the 2004 actuarial valuation, it has been agreed to increase the pension cost charged in these accounts to 15% of pensionable salaries for the principal schemes, in line with the cash contribution rate.
The contribution rate paid by employees in the principal schemes is 5% of pensionable salaries.
These schemes remain open to eligible new employees.
The pension charge for the year ended 3rd October, 2004 was 34.7 million 2003 23.8 million.
81 Daily Mail and General Trust plc NOTES TO THE BALANCE SHEETS Continued 39 Pension Arrangements continued The components of the total pension charge were as follows: 2004 2003 m m Regular Cost 38.8 36.6 Variation regular cost 4.1 12.8 Total pension charge 34.7 23.8 A prepayment of 53.1 million 2003 41.1 million is included under debtors, representing the excess of accumulated contributions paid over the equivalent pension charge.
This includes an advance payment into the Groups pension schemes amounting to 26.9 million in respect of the 2005 contributions 2004 21.4 million.
A provision of 1.1million 2003 0.7 million is included in provisions, representing the excess of the accumulated pension charge over pension contributions paid.
The effect of UITF 6, Accounting for post-retirement benefits other than pensions, is not material.
FRS 17 In accordance with the requirements of FRS 17, Retirement Benefits, this note sets out the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the schemes and the fair value of assets held.
Additionally, this note discloses the amounts that would be charged or recognised in the accounts under FRS 17, together with an analysis of the movement in scheme surpluses or deficits which would result.
As permitted by FRS 17, the costs, accruals and prepayments recorded in the accounts continue to be reported under the requirements of SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
Defined Benefit Schemes The figures in this note are based on the calculations carried out in connection with the formal actuarial valuation of the main schemes as at 31st March, 2004, currently in progress, and updated to 3rd October, 2004 by the actuary.
