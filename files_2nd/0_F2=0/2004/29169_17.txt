51 19 Pension Scheme The Company, in conjunction with the Alliance Trust Group, operates an insured defined benefit pension scheme the Scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The Schemes assets, which are invested to finance members pensions on retirement, are held separately from the Companys funds.
The Scheme is administered externally on behalf of the Trustees.
Scheme Funding Rate The Scheme funding rate is determined, at intervals not exceeding 3 years, on the recommendation of a qualified independent actuary.
The latest full actuarial valuation report was carried out as at 1 April 2003.
The report was produced using the projected unit method of valuation.
It showed assets valued on a discounted income basis at 10,899,000 and a surplus of 721,000 over present value liabilities at the report date.
The principal assumptions used in this valuation were: Rate of increase in pensionable salaries p. a.
5.0% Rate of increase of pensions in payment p. a.
3.0% Rate of increase of deferred pensions p. a.
7.0% Rate of dividend growth p. a.
3.0% Following the recommendation of the actuary, the Company and the Alliance Trust Group have adopted a funding rate of 22.1% of pensionable salaries from 1 April 2004 23.1% was paid in the previous triennium and an additional contribution of 109,000 was made by the Company in the year to 31 July 2003.
This contribution rate is due to be reviewed following the triennial valuation of the Scheme as at 1 April 2006 and excludes administration fees and insurance premiums for death-in-service benefits, which the companies pay separately and which total a further 2% 1.4% of pensionable salaries.
The total pension cost including administration fees and the cost of insurance of death-in-service benefits to the Company was 140,000 250,000.
Accounting for Pension Costs While the Company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS17 the following transitional disclosures are required as at 31 July 2004 using the different measurement basis prescribed by the Standard.
In order to meet these requirements, a separate valuation of the Schemes present assets and liabilities has been undertaken by the actuary as at 31 July 2004.
The assumptions used by the actuary, which meet the requirements of FRS17, were: Rate of increase in salaries p. a.
4.00% Rate of increase of pensions in payment p. a.
3.00% Rate of increase of deferred pensions p. a.
3.00% Rate used to discount scheme liabilities p. a.
3.00% Fair Value of the Schemes Assets On these assumptions, the fair value of the Schemes assets, and the value of the Schemes liabilities at 31 July 2004, were: 000 Assets 13,984 Liabilities 13,705 Surplus 279 The Schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short-term and their value may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The liabilities are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and are also subject to uncertainty.
The assumed long-term rate of return over the following year is, 7.0% for equities, 5.25% for bonds and 4.0% for other assets.
At 31 July 2004, 50.6% of the assets of the Scheme were held in equities, 40.8% in bonds and 8.6% in current assets.
For the purposes of these financial statements these figures are illustrative only and do not impact on the Companys balance sheet at 31 July 2004.
The Company pays a proportion of the employers total contribution, based on the Companys share of staff cost allocation for the year.
The Scheme assets are not identified to individuals or to the time periods in respect of which the original contributions were made.
Scheme liabilities are identifiable but not to individual participating employers.
Consequently, in the terms required by FRS17, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the scheme.
Accordingly, the Company accounts for its participation in the Scheme as if the Scheme were a defined contribution scheme.
