Notes to the financial statements 45 at 21 August 2004 Punch Taverns plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 www.
Accounting policies Accounting period The accounting period of the Group ends on the Saturday falling between 17 August and 24 August each year.
The accounting period ended 21 August 2004 was of 52 weeks duration, the period ended 23 August 2003 was of 53 weeks duration.
Basis of preparation The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain properties within the Group and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
In accordance with FRS 18 the Directors have continued to review the accounting policies.
There have been no changes in accounting policy.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Punch Taverns plc and all its subsidiary undertakings for the 52 weeks to 21 August 2004.
All subsidiaries are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
Accordingly, the Group profit and loss account and statement of cash flows include the results and cash flows of subsidiaries from the date of acquisition to the period end.
Goodwill and negative goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised in the balance sheet within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over its useful economic life up to a presumed maximum of 20 years.
Acquisitions giving rise to goodwill and their associated amortisation periods of 20 years commenced as follows: Punch Taverns Group Ltd: September 1999 Commer Inns: December 2001 White Rose Inns Ltd: May 2002 Conquest Inns Ltd: December 2002 Pubmistress Ltd: December 2003 Negative goodwill arising on acquisitions is included within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over the estimated useful life of the non-monetary assets acquired, which is approximately 22 years.
Acquisitions giving rise to negative goodwill and their associated amortisation periods commenced as follows: Inn Business Group plc: September 1999 Allied Domecq Retailing Holdings Ltd: September 1999 Fixed assets and depreciation Valuation Trading properties within the estate are revalued professionally by independent valuers on a five-year rolling basis.
Surpluses arising from the professional valuation of the estate are taken directly to the revaluation reserve.
Valuation surpluses realised on sale are transferred from the revaluation reserve to the profit and loss account reserve.
Any deficit arising from the professional valuation of properties is taken directly to the revaluation reserve until the carrying amount reaches historical cost and thereafter, deficits below historical costs are charged to the profit and loss account except to the extent that the value in use exceeds the valuation in which case this is taken to the revaluation reserve.
Depreciation It is the Groups policy to maintain the properties comprising the licensed estate in such a condition that the residual values of the properties, based on prices prevailing at the time of acquisition or subsequent revaluation, are at least equal to their book values.
The primary responsibility for the maintenance of such properties, ensuring that they remain in sound operational condition, is normally that of the lessee as required by their lease contracts with the Group.
Having regard to this, it is the opinion of the Directors that depreciation of any such property as required by the Companies Act 1985 and generally accepted accounting practice would not be material.
It is the opinion of the Directors that it is not practical or appropriate to separate from the value of the buildings the value of long life fixtures and fittings, which are an integral part of the buildings.
This approach is supported by the opinion of an independent external adviser.
Landlords fixtures and fittings include removable items, which are generally regarded as within landlord ownership.
These are depreciated in accordance with the policy detailed below.
An annual impairment review is carried out on all properties in accordance with FRS 11 and FRS 15.
Notes to the financial statements 46 at 21 August 2004 continued Punch Taverns plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 www.
Accounting policies continued Depreciation is provided on other tangible fixed assets at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Short leasehold properties over the lease term Landlords fixtures and fittings 5 years Office furniture and fittings 5 years Information technology developments over 3 to 10 years Information technology equipment 3 years Motor vehicles 5 years Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for tax on gains arising from the revaluation and similar fair value adjustments of fixed assets, or gains on disposal of fixed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to dispose of those assets concerned.
However, no provision is made where, on the basis of all available evidence at the balance sheet date, it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only where the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Leasing commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Pensions The Group operates a defined benefit scheme based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over employees working lives with the Group.
The Group contributes to money purchase pension plans for other employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Capital instruments Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and if not they are included in shareholders funds.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Derivative financial instruments are held to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
To qualify as a hedge the financial instrument must be related to actual borrowings or a probable commitment and must reduce the risk of interest rate movements.
Gains and losses arising on these financial instruments are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
The cost or income associated with caps and floors is recognised over the lesser of their duration or the period of the loans to which they relate, so as to give a constant proportion of the related loan notes outstanding.
In respect of interest rate swaps, interest differentials are recognised by accruing for net interest payable or receivable.
Interest rate caps, floors or swaps are not revalued to fair value if they are being used for hedging purposes.
If an instrument, which was being used as a hedge, is terminated early the gain or loss arising is spread over the remaining maturity of the original instrument.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge because the underlying financial position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Employee share schemes The consideration paid for the Companys own shares held by the Employee Share Option Plan are deducted from shareholders funds in accordance with UITF 38.
On unconditional vesting of these options the amount is transferred to the profit and loss reserves.
Notes to the financial statements 47 at 21 August 2004 continued Punch Taverns plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 www.
Turnover and segmental analysis Turnover, which is stated net of value added tax, represents amounts charged to third parties.
Turnover, operating profit and assets and liabilities relate to the primary activity of leasing public houses to independent publicans and the wholesale supply of beer products to lessees.
A small number of pubs are directly managed by GRS Inns Ltd, part of the acquired Pubmaster group of companies, but do not have a material impact on the turnover, operating profit or assets of the group.
Turnover includes rent receivable from the licensed estate of 162.6m August 2003: 117.7m.
Operating profit The profit and loss account down to operating profit is split between ongoing and acquired operations as follows: 53 weeks ended 23 August 52 weeks ended 21 August 2004 2003 1 Ongoing Acquisitions Total Total m m m m Turnover 441.7 195.9 637.6 429.0 Cost of sales 155.2 85.7 240.9 153.3 Gross profit 286.5 110.2 396.7 275.7 Administrative expenses: Amortisation of goodwill 1.7 3.1 4.8 1.7 Depreciation 7.7 3.7 11.4 5.5 Exceptional items note 4 3.2 5.0 8.2 Other 38.0 19.3 57.3 41.1 Total administrative expenses 50.6 31.1 81.7 48.3 Operating profit 235.9 79.1 315.0 227.4 Other administrative expenses includes: Amortisation Goodwill 3.3 3.1 6.4 3.4 Negative goodwill 1.6 1.6 1.7 Depreciation of owned fixed assets 7.7 3.7 11.4 5.5 Auditors remuneration Audit services 0.2 0.1 0.3 0.2 2 Non audit services Operating lease rentals Land Buildings 2.4 1.5 3.9 2.9 Plant and equipment 0.6 0.7 1.3 0.4 1 Relates to the acquisition of Pubmistress Limited, ultimate parent of the Pubmaster trading companies 2 In addition to auditors remuneration set out above, fees of 0.9m August 2003: 0.1m were incurred relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries note 26 and fees of 0.3m August 2003: nil were incurred in relation to the refinancing of the Groups debt note 18.

Taxation The tax charge is made up as follows: Period ended Period ended 21 August 23 August 2004 2003 m m Current tax UK corporation tax 6.0 1.8 Tax over provided in previous periods 0.1 6.0 1.7 Deferred tax Current period charge 24.8 14.0 24.8 14.0 30.8 15.7 Factors affecting current and future tax charges The current tax charge for the period reflects the utilisation of brought forward losses not previously recognised as deferred tax assets.
The deferred tax charge arises in respect of the origination and reversal of timing differences.
The Groups current period deferred tax charge reflects that in the period capital allowances exceeded depreciation.
This position is expected to continue given the Groups accounting policy not to charge depreciation on freehold and long leasehold on the basis that this would not be material.
The tax charge will be lower than the standard corporation tax rate of 30% over the next two to three years if the Group is successful in using brought forward losses.
As a result of the acquisition of Pubmistress Ltd, the Group owns further companies having tax losses.
These tax losses may be used against any future taxable profits of the companies in which they originated.
The charge to UK corporation tax is reconciled as follows: Reconciliation of tax charges Period ended Period ended 21 August 23 August 2004 2003 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 133.3 113.3 Profit on ordinary activities at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% 40.0 34.0 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 2.2 2.1 Timing differences relating to fixed assets 8.6 12.0 Short term timing differences 8.8 0.9 Loss profit on sale of tangible fixed assets 3.6 0.8 Utilisation of tax losses brought forward 23.0 20.6 Adjustment to tax charge in respect of previous periods 0.1 Surplus current period losses 0.6 Corporation tax charge for period 6.0 1.7 The taxation charge for the period is reduced due to the utilisation of brought forward losses within the Group.
Profit attributable to members of the parent company The Company made a profit after tax for the period of 50.6m August 2003: 45.7m.
The Company retained profits of 28.1m August 2003: 29.6m.

Guaranteed loan notes of 73.0m for the Group August 2003: 74.2m and 39.0m for the Company August 2003: 39.0m are secured against bank deposits of an equal amount guaranteed by Barclays Bank plc.
The Guaranteed loans are repayable on demand at the option of the loan holder up to the final repayment dates noted above.
The bank loans are at floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
On 3 November 2003 the Group concluded a refinancing that led to a simplified securitisation structure with all secured loan notes issued at that date being issued by Punch Taverns Finance plc within a single securitisation net see below.
The refinancing raised net proceeds of 265.0m that was made available for investment purposes.
The refinancing led to an improvement in the maturity profile of the Groups borrowings and a reduction, although modest due to the continuing effect of interest rate swaps the Group presently has in place, in the effective interest rate on the Groups borrowings.
Notes to the financial statements 56 at 21 August 2004 continued Punch Taverns plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 www.
Loans continued On 1 December 2003 the Group, through its acquisition of Pubmistress Ltd and its subsidiaries, acquired secured loan notes with a nominal value of 894.2m book value including fair value premium 980.8m issued by Pubmaster Finance Ltd and bank term loans totalling 114.6m.
Immediately following the acquisition the bank term loans were repaid in full together with an accrued deferred fee of 5.2m.
The deferred fee is reflected in the fair value of assets acquired note 26.

Loans continued Hedging Instruments The Group has taken out various hedging instruments to reduce the interest rate risk associated with floating rate loans as follows: Punch Taverns Finance plc As part of the refinancing, the Group entered into new interest rate swaps on 3 November 2003 which swap the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A3 R and Class M2 floating rate notes to fixed rates of 6.275%.
The capital amount of these swaps reduces over time to match the expected repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
Prior to refinancing, the Group had entered into interest rate swaps which swapped the LIBOR interest rate on the Class A1, Class A2 and Class A3 floating rate notes to fixed rates ranging from 6.2% to 6.5175% per annum.
The capital amount of these swaps reduced over time to match the expected repayment profile of the floating rate notes.
These swap arrangements were cancelled as part of the refinancing on 3 November 2003 following redemption of the floating rate notes and replaced with the new swap arrangements described above.
In October 2000 the Group entered into a swaption exercisable before 15 October 2005 which can swap LIBOR on a capital amount of up to 25.0m for a fixed rate of 9% until October 2027.
This was cancelled on 3 November 2003 as part of the refinancing.
There was no net cost to the Group as a result of the issue of new interest swap arrangements within Punch Taverns Finance plc and termination of the old interest rate swap and swaption arrangements within Punch Taverns Finance plc and Punch Funding II Limited.
Punch Funding II Ltd Prior to refinancing the Group had interest rate swap arrangements which swapped the LIBOR interest rate on the Class M, Class N1 and Class O floating rate notes to a fixed rate of 6.4973% per annum.
These swap arrangements were cancelled following the redemption of the floating rate notes as part of the refinancing on 3 November 2003 and replaced with new swap arrangements within the Punch Taverns Finance plc security net see above.
In June 2000 the Group entered into a swaption exercisable before 28 June 2005 which can swap LIBOR on a capital amount of up to 23.6m for a fixed rate of 8% until June 2030.
Pubmaster Finance Limited Interest rate swap agreements have been entered into, to swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 5.7535% on the Class A1 and Class A2 notes and to 5.7% on the Class A4 and Class A5 notes.
Other bank loans In January 2003 the Group entered into interest rate swaps which swap the LIBOR interest rate to a fixed rate of 4.44% until January 2005.
The nominal capital impacted varies over the life of the swap currently being 21.0m and falling to 20.2m from October 2004 through to January 2005.
At the date of acquisition of Pubmistress Ltd, interest rate swap arrangements were in place to cover the bank terms loans at a fixed rate of 6.0761%.
These swaps were terminated at the same time as the loans to which they related were redeemed.
Financial instruments The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings and some cash.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to provide finance for the Groups operations.
The Group has various other financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors, which arise directly from its operations.
The Group enters into derivative transactions.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
There is no currency exposure as all transactions and financial instruments are in sterling.
The board reviews and agrees policies for each of these risks and they are summarised below: Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of equity shareholders funds, loan notes and other bank loans.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then employs financial instruments to generate the desired interest rate profile and to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The cash balances attract interest at floating rates.
Where over-hedging arises for example, due to early repayment of floating rate notes the Group will seek to eliminate the over-hedging, where this is financially practical, either by embedding the cost in new swaps or by terminating the over-hedge.
Notes to the financial statements 59 at 21 August 2004 continued Punch Taverns plc Annual report and financial statements 2004 www.
Financial instruments continued The Group has taken out capital instruments such that 98% of all loans at 21 August 2004 August 2003: 91% were either at fixed rate or were converted to fixed rate as a result of swap arrangements.

Pension commitments Defined Benefit Scheme Pubmistress Ltd Contributions to the defined benefit pension scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The pension cost for the year in relation to this scheme represents the contributions payable by the Group and amounted to 0.4m from date of acquisition.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuation using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation was 6 April 2001.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are: the investment return on the assets of the plan will on average exceed general salary inflation by at least 2.25% per annum over the long term: future increases in salaries of staff and executive members will be in line with experience of similar schemes: pensions can be secured on a gross rate of interest of at least 6.0% per annum before allowing for pension increases at the rate of 3.0% per annum.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 27.5m and that the value of those assets represented 106.0% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
An actuarial assessment as at the date Pubmistress Ltd was acquired 1 December 2003 indicated that the scheme had a current funding deficit of 4.3m.
This amount has been provided as a fair value adjustment note 26.

Pension commitments continued Defined Benefit Scheme Spirit Group Pension Scheme Prior to the demerger of Spirit Group Limited Demerger on 2 March 2002 the Group operated a defined benefit pension scheme, which required contributions to be made to a separately administered fund.
The principal employer was Spirit Group Ltd, which was disposed at Demerger, and consequently the Group ceased at that time to operate its own defined benefit pension scheme.
Employees of the continuing business who were members of that scheme continued to be members following Demerger up until April 2003 when contributions ceased, and the Group ceased to record any ongoing costs in respect of this scheme.
Contributions to this fund were charged in the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives within the Group.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged in the profit and loss account were treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
During the period ended 21 August 2004 a final one-off contribution, required under the terms of the Demerger, of 0.6m was paid to the scheme in respect of the Groups employees who were members of the scheme.
This sum was provided for at Demerger.
The Group now contributes to money purchase plans in respect of employees who were members of the defined benefit scheme.
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme into which existing members of the Spirit Group Pension Scheme were given the opportunity to transfer their benefits or they were able to leave them in the scheme.
These transfers have now been finalised.
In the prior periods contributions to the defined benefit scheme were charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives within the Group.
The contributions were determined by a qualified actuary, on the basis of triennial valuations, using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuation at time of Demerger was as at 5 April 2001.
The valuation method used was the projected unit method with the following main assumptions: Long term average investment yield before retirement 6.8% after retirement 5.8% Long term average earnings increase 3.9% Increases to pensions in payment with 3% underpin 3.5% without 3% underpin 2.4% Long term average price inflation 2.4% The valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 52.8m and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 92% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for future increases in benefits.
FRS 17 disclosures scheme funding Pubmistress Ltd Scheme The acquired Pubmistress Ltd business operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried as at 6 April 2001.
The results of that valuation have been projected to 21 August 2004 and then recalculated based on the following assumptions: At At 21 August 1 December 2004 2003 Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.00% Rate of increase in pensions 2.75% 2.50% Discount rate 5.75% 5.75% Inflation assumption 3.00% 2.75% Revaluation of deferred pensions 3.00% 2.75% date of acquisition of the Pubmaster group of companies Since April 2003 the company has paid contributions of 16% of salaries.
The contributions paid for the period which equates to the charge for the period in respect of this defined benefit scheme were 0.4m August 2003: nil.

However, going forward the Group will not have any liabilities or assets associated with the scheme.
The Company contributed to the scheme at the rates of 23% of Pensionable Salaries for executives and 11% for others since the scheme commenced on 5 April 2000.
The principal assumptions used by the independent qualified actuaries in updating the latest valuation scheme for FRS 17 purposes for the periods ending 17 August 2002 and 23 August 2003 were: Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% Rate of increase in pensions 3.5% For former members of the Allied arrangements 2.5% For all other members Discount rate 5.7% Inflation assumption 2.5% The normal contributions paid for the period which equates to the charge for the period in respect of the defined benefit scheme were nil August 2003: 0.3m.

Related party disclosures Current period information There were no transactions with directors or other related parties requiring disclosure under FRS8 Related Party Disclosures.
Prior period information During the period ended 23 August 2003 34 pubs were acquired for cash from Spirit Group Limited, part of the managed business demerged in March 2002, for 12.8m.
Contingent liabilities The Demerger of the Managed pub business on 2 March 2002 was carried out under the provisions of ss213-218 ICTA 1988.
Usually, where a chargeable asset for tax purposes is transferred from one company to another company and both companies are within the same group, this transfer is at no gain no loss initially for tax purposes.
However, by virtue of s179 TCGA 1992 where the transferee company leaves the groups ownership within 6 years of the date of the transfer, a capital gain or loss will arise on the transferee by reference to the market value of the asset and the no gain no loss acquisition consideration.
Where the transferee company leaves the group under an exempt distribution, there is an exemption from the s179 charge.
However, the exemption from charge under s179 TCGA 1992 does not apply if there is a chargeable payment a payment not made for bona fide commercial reasons or made for tax avoidance purposes within 5 years of the exempt distribution.
A Deed of Tax Covenant was entered into by the Group and Spirit Group Holdings Ltd on 2 March 2002 as part of the Demerger.
Under this Deed of Tax Covenant the Group has indemnified the Managed pub business for any s179 TCGA 1992 exit charges that would arise if the Group made a chargeable payment within 5 years of the Demerger or otherwise prevented the Demerger dividend from being an exempt distribution.
Post balance sheet events On 10 September 2004 the Directors announced that Punch Taverns ITB Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company, acquired the entire share capital of InnSpired Group Ltd.
The acquisition values InnSpired at approximately 335m including the assumption of 258m of external debt.
The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash and loans from the Groups existing resources.
InnSpired, a private company, operates a leased and tenanted pub estate of 1,064 pubs located throughout England and Wales.
In order to address specific areas of local concentration, Punch Taverns PGE Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Punch Taverns plc, agreed to sell 88 pubs to Admiral Taverns for a total cash consideration of 22.6 million.
Of the 88 pubs sold, 51 were from the InnSpired estate and 37 were from the existing Punch estate.
On 21 October 2004 the Group agreed terms to redeem the fixed rate component of the InnSpired securitisation loan notes and announced plans to redeem the remaining securitisation loan notes, to be replaced initially by short term borrowing.
This redemption was achieved in full by 22 November 2004.
