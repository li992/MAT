The following factors that will affect the Group's future total tax charge are: the mix of profits between UK and overseas companies.
With the exception of the Republic of Ireland and Poland, all overseas trading companies attract a higher corporation tax rate than that suffered in the UK of 30%.
If the proportion of profits from overseas companies increases, this could result in a higher Group tax charge.
the adverse impact of permanent disallowables, including non tax deductible amortisation of goodwill, on the Group tax charge.
The Group has taken account of primarily all trading losses in its deferred tax balance.
Although tax losses can be used to reduce cash payments of tax, utilisation of such losses would result in a deferred tax charge in that year which would eliminate any profit and loss benefit.

The movement in the US Senior loan notes, between 2003 and 2004 is a result of the movements in Euro Sterling exchange rate on the associated derivative contracts.
In accordance with SSAP 20 Foreign currency translation, the exchange loss of 0.296m has been taken to the exchange reserve to offset exchange gains on retranslation of Euro denominated overseas net assets.
15 Derivatives and other financial instruments The Finance Directors Review on pages 24 to 27 provides an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the year in creating or changing the risks the Group faces in its activities.
The numerical disclosures in this note deal with financial assets and financial liabilities as defined in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments.
Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary undertakings are excluded from the scope of these disclosures, as are short-term debtors and creditors, other than the currency disclosures.
Interest rate profile The Group has no financial assets other than cash at bank including cash deposits repayable on demand of 19.467m 2003 : 55.417m which are part of the financing arrangements of the Group.
After taking into account interest rate and currency swaps, the interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: Floating Fixed Floating Fixed Total rate rate Total rate rate 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s 000s Sterling 37,231 37,231 27,416 27,416 Euro 74,824 2,598 72,226 97,263 4,063 93,200 US Dollar 5,730 652 5,078 7,053 1,054 5,999 Total 117,785 3,250 114,535 131,732 5,117 126,615 The fixed rates are fixed for a period of between one and thirteen years.
The interest rate on floating rate financial liabilities is linked to LIBOR for Euro liabilities and the US prime rate and LIBOR for US Dollar liabilities.
24.149m 2003 : 24.149m of the Sterling and 70.119m 2003 : 69.823m of the Euro fixed rate liabilities relate to the unsecured US Senior loan notes repayable in 2008 and 2011 and attract an average interest rate of 6.851% 2003 : 6.851%.

The remaining Sterling fixed rate liabilities of 12.014m 2003 : nil have a weighted average interest rate of 3.8% 2003 : nil and are repayable over a weighted average period of one year 2003 : nil.
Of this amount, 7.006m is loan notes payable in respect of certain acquisitions made during the year.
The remaining Euro fixed rate liabilities of 1.219m 2003 : 22.032m have a weighted average interest rate of 3.6% 2003 : 2.7% and are repayable over a weighted average period of three years 2003 : one year.
The US Dollar fixed rate liability attracts an interest rate of 2.92% 2003 : 1.63% and is repayable within one year.
Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas in other words, its structural currency exposures are to maintain medium term borrowings to minimise currency exposures on foreign currency assets.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Euro and US Dollar denominated borrowings after taking into account currency swaps set out on page 65 represent a hedge against the Groups overseas net investments, and therefore the exchange gains and losses arising are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses and not in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
Transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account are minimal as Group companies do not enter into significant amounts of cross border transactions.
The amount arising in the Group during 2004 in respect of transactional exposures amounted to a loss of 112,000 2003 : gain of 171,000.
Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: Borrowings 2004 2003 000s 000s In one year or less 14,602 34,218 In more than one year but not more than two years 8,180 2,665 In more than two years but not more than five years 34,632 34,556 In more than five years 60,371 60,293 Total 117,785 131,732 Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December 2004 as follows: Borrowings 2004 2003 000s 000s Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 25,007 21,937 Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 8,446 676 Expiring in more than five years 361 Total 33,814 22,613 Fair values The estimated fair value of financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 was: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 000s 000s 000s 000s US Senior loan notes 94,268 63,854 93,972 68,128 US Senior loan note swaps 37,039 28,640 Cash less overdrafts 16,501 16,501 51,356 51,356 Bank loans 11,590 11,590 29,085 29,085 Loan notes 7,006 7,006 Total 96,363 102,988 71,701 74,497 The fair values of overdraft, bank loans and loan notes are not considered materially different to their book values.
The fair value of the US Senior loan notes and their associated swaps are calculated by discounting the associated future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at 31 December 2004.
The US Senior loan notes and their associated swaps form a net investment hedge of the Groups European businesses and consequently, differences under UK GAAP between fair value and book value are not expected to impact the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.

Leasehold dilapidations These provisions relate to contractual obligations to reinstate leasehold properties into their original state of repair at the end of the lease.
The provisions are calculated with reference to the expired portion of individual lease agreements where such a clause exists in the lease contract.
The transfer of economic benefits will be made at the end of the leases as set out in note 22.
Other amounts relate principally to claims provisions.

Guarantees The Company has cross guaranteed overdrafts of subsidiary undertakings amounting to 5.894m 2003 : 8.011m.
d. Pension schemes The Group operates a number of pension schemes, six 2003 : six of which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
Of these schemes, four 2003 : four have assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes all of which are independently managed.
The defined benefit schemes are herein after referred to as the main scheme and other schemes, being five smaller schemes.
Change in presentation In the prior year, two book reserved schemes operated in Germany and France were reported within other provisions.
In 2004, in accordance with FRS 17, these are now included as part of the FRS 17 pension liability.
The effect of this change in presentation as at 31 December 2003 is a restatement to decrease the provision for liabilities and charges from 9.327m to 8.131m, to increase net assets excluding pension liability from 213.461m to 214.657m, and to increase the pension liability from 13.701m to 14.897m.
There was no effect on the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations The actuarial valuations of the defined benefits pension schemes are assessed by an independent actuary every three years who recommends the rate of contribution payable each year.
The main actuarial assumptions in the pension assessments were that over the long term the annual investment return would be 2% higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries, and after retirement 2.5% higher than the annual price inflation-linked increase in pensions.
The last formal actuarial valuations of three of the defined benefits schemes including the main scheme were conducted at 1 January 2004, and showed that the market value of the schemes assets were 29.8m, 7.8m and 1.9m and their actuarial values covered 64%, 94% and 70% respectively of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The last formal actuarial valuation of the fourth defined benefit scheme was at 6 April 2004 and showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 1.2m and its actuarial value covered 60% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries.
The fifth and sixth schemes are book reserved schemes whereby the sponsoring company does not hold any separate assets to fund the pension scheme but make a reserve in their accounts.
Therefore, these schemes do not hold separate scheme assets.
The liabilities of the schemes are met by the sponsoring companies.
72 SIG plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS continued 22 Guarantees and other financial commitments continued d. Pension schemes continued Consolidated Profit and Loss Account Charges The pension charge for the year relating to the main scheme was 1.440m 2003 : 1.458m, 0.432m 2003 : 0.370m in relation to other schemes and was 2.521m 2003 : 2.453m in relation to defined contribution schemes.
In accordance with FRS 17 Retirement benefits, the charge for the defined benefit schemes has been calculated as the sum of the cost of benefits accruing in the year, the increase in the value of benefits already accrued and the expected return on assets.
The Group contribution to the main scheme including fixed monthly contributions during the year amounted to 31.7% of pensionable salaries.
In addition, in December 2004, a special contribution of 4.0m was made to the main scheme on advice of the actuary.
The actuarial valuations described above have been updated at 31 December 2004 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The four UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new members, have an age profile that is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The two overseas book reserved schemes remain open to new members.
Consolidated Balance Sheet liability The net balance sheet liability position in respect of the six defined benefit schemes can be summarised as follows: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Restated Restated 000's 000's 000's 000's Deficit in the main scheme 18,791 15,445 Related deferred tax asset 6,537 4,633 Net pension liability of the main scheme 12,254 10,812 Deficit in the other defined benefit schemes 6,145 5,323 Related deferred tax asset 1,367 1,238 Net pension liability of the other defined benefit schemes 4,778 4,085 Total pension liability 17,032 14,897 The net actuarial loss, adjusted for deferred tax, for the year recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses amounted to 6,194,000 2003 : gain of 234,000.
