NOTES TO THE GROUP ACCOUNTS 1.
Accounting Policies The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and include the disclosures required by Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17.
In applying these policies management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results coulddiffer fromthose estimates.
Consolidation The Group accounts include the accounts of Smith & Nephew plc the Company and all the subsidiaries and associated undertakings for the periods during which they were members of the Group.

Appropriate provisions for returns, trade discounts and other allowances are deducted from turnover.
Other turnover is recorded as earned or as services are performed.
ForeignCurrencies Balance sheet items of overseas companies and foreign currency borrowings are translated into Sterling at the year end rates of exchange.
Profit and loss items and the cash flows of overseas subsidiary  undertakingsare translated at the average rates forthe year.
Forward currency contracts in respect of contracted and anticipated amounts payable on purchase transactions are accounted for as hedges with the hedged transaction recorded at the rate implicit in the contract.
Changes in the fair value of these forward contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account onthe ultimate sale ofthe itempurchased.
The following are recorded as movements in reserves: exchange differences on the translation at closing rates of exchange of overseas opening net assets, including acquisition goodwill: the difference on translation of foreign currency borrowings or swaps that are used to finance or hedge Group equity investments: and the differences arising between the translation of profits at average and closing exchange rates.
All  are dealt withinarrivingat profitbefore taxation.
Intangible Fixed Assets Prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill representing the excess of purchase consideration over fair value of net assets acquired was set-off against reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill acquired since 31 December 1997 and other acquired intangibles are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, between 3 and 20 years, except for goodwill arising on the formation of the BSN Medical joint venture and acquisition of the Groups share of the AbilityOne associated undertaking, whichis not amortised but issubject .
Thistreatment, whichisa departure from the requirement of the Companies Act 1985 of Great Britain the Companies Act to amortise goodwill, is adopted in order to show a true and fair view See Note 15 and Note 16.

They are recorded as stock until they are deployed at which point they are transferred tofixed assets anddepreciated overtheiruseful lives.
Financial Instruments Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are translated into Sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Changes in the principal values of currency swaps are matched in reserves against changes in the values of the related assets.
The fixed rate element of currency swaps and interest rate swaps transacted to protect interest costs and income are accounted for as hedges.
Changes inthe values ofinterest rate hedges are recognisedagainst interest inthe periodrelatingtothe hedge.
Deferred Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligationtopay more, ora righttopay less ortoreceivemore, tax.
No provision is made for deferred tax that would arise on the remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures except to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accruedas receivable.
Accounting Policies continued Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is likely that taxable incomewillbe available against whichfuturereversals ofthe  canbe made.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse.
These are based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balancesheet date.
Post-Retirement Benefits The Groups major pension plans are of the defined benefit type.
For these plans, in accordance with SSAP 24, costs are charged to operating profit so as to spread the expense of providing future pensions to employees over their working lives with the Group.
For defined contribution plans, contributions are charged to operating profit as they become payable.
Where the Group provides healthcare benefits after retirement, the expected costofthese  employees workinglives withthe Group.
Contingenciesand Provisions In the normal course of business the Group is involved in numerous legal disputes.
Provision is made for loss contingencies when it is deemed probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated.
Where the Group is the plaintiff in pursuing claims against third parties legal andassociated expenses are  accountas incurred.
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is deemed probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reasonablyestimated.
Exceptional costs are allocated as follows: Orthopaedics 80.0m 2003 17.6m, 2002 0.8m, Endoscopy nil 2003 4.8 m, 2002 7.6m and Advanced wound management nil 2003 nil, 2002 21.5m.
Group management reviews and monitors business unit performance by use of key performance indicators which differ in certain respects from the way results are reported in the Group Accounts which are determined byUK GAAP andUS GAAP.
Business units report sales of continuing operations only and at constant rates of exchange throughout a particular year.
The effects of currency movements are excluded by setting at the beginning of each year exchange rates whichremain constant throughoutthe year.
Theseare termed the Management Rates MR for the year.
These are reset each year and prior year comparative data re-translated to the new rates.
Additional sales brought in by acquisitions, for which there are no prior year comparatives, are excluded from the calculation of underlying sales growth which is managements key indicator of sales performance.
In the tables below, underlying sales growth can be calculated by dividing current year turnover at MR by  MR. Business units report operating profit of continuing operations before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items andat constantrates ofexchangeduringthe year.
Management believes the Groups internal reporting measures are the most appropriate since they focus on underlying business performance and exclude the distorting effects of exchange rate translation and nonoperatingitems.
Thesemeasures are used infinancialreporting, budgets, .

Share Option Plans The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002 adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002 is available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months service.
The scheme provides for employees to save up to 250 per month and gives them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved.
The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle market quotations of the Ordinary Shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation.
The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan 2002 is offered to employees in Australia, Austria, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Puerto Rico, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.
Employees in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and France are able to participate respectively in the Smith & Nephew Belgian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Italian Sharesave Plan 2002, the Smith & Nephew Dutch Sharesave Plan 2002 and the Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan 2002.
Participants in Ireland are able to participate in the Smith & Nephew Irish Employee Share Option Scheme.
These plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan 2002.
Options are no longer issued under the Smith & Nephew Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 14 May 1981 and the Smith & Nephew 1991 Overseas Employee Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 25 May 1990 but options remain to be exercised under these two schemes.
Together all of the plans referred toabove are termed the Employee Schemes.
Employees in the United States are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of ADSs, at a discount of 15% or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plans quarterly purchase period to the market price, through a regular savings plan.
The Smith & Nephew 1985 Share Option Scheme adopted by shareholders on 9 May 1985, the Smith & Nephew 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme adopted , the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001 and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2004, together termed the Executive Schemes, are operated at the discretionofthe BoardofDirectors.
Under the terms of the Executive Schemes, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may select full-time employees of the Group for the grant of options to acquire Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share Plan the US Plan are to acquire ADSs.
For options granted prior to 2001, the option price was not less than the market value of an Ordinary Share, or the nominal value if higher.
The market value being the quoted price on the business day preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant.
For Executive Schemes adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an Ordinary Share for the three business days preceding the date of grant or, for the US Plan, the average quoted price of an ADS for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the date of grant if higher.
With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan, the exercise of options granted from 1997 are subject to achievement of a performance condition.
Options granted under the 2001 US Plan are not subject to performance conditions but become exercisable as to 10% after one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years.
The 1990 International Executive Share Option Scheme and the 2004 Plan are open to senior managers worldwide.
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan is open to senior managers outside the US and the US Plan is open to senior managers in the US, Canada, MexicoandPuertoRico.
Under the Executive Schemes, the number of Ordinary Shares over which options may be granted is limited so that the number of shares issued or that may be issued under the Executive Schemes during the ten years preceding the date of grant shall not exceed 5% of the Ordinary Share capital at the date of grant.
The total number of Ordinary Shares which may be issuable in any ten-year period under all employee share schemes operated bythe Companymaynotexceed 10% ofthe OrdinaryShare capital at the date ofgrant.
Share Option Plans continued Options granted in 2004 under executive schemes were valued using a binomial model provided by an independent actuary.
Options granted under employee schemes were valued using the Black-Scholes Option pricing model.
This had previously been used for all options granted in 2003 and 2002.
The binomial model was used for executive schemes so that proper allowance is made for the presence of performance conditions and the possibility of early exercise.
Options granted under each scheme are valued separately anda weightedaverage fairvalue calculated.

The QUEST was not used in 2003 and 2004 and the Company does not intend to use it in the future.
The trustee of the QUEST was Smith & Nephew Employees Trustees Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
During 2002, the QUEST subscribed for 950,317 shares at a cost of 2.3m and transferred a total of 950,317 shares to employees on the exercise of options for consideration of 1.4m.
All employees of UK Group subsidiary companies, including Executive directors ofthe Company, werepotential  QUEST.
Long-Term Incentive Plans The Group has operated a long-term incentive plan LTIP for Executive directors and GEC members since 1997.
Vesting of LTIP awards is dependent on the Groups relative performance in a group of 43 UK listed manufacturing companies with substantial international activities, using total shareholder return TSR over a three yearperiodas the primemeasure.
In 2004, a new share based incentive plan was introduced for executive directors, members of the GEC and the next level of senior executives, which replaced the LTIP.
The plan includes a Performance Share Plan PSP anda Co-Investment Plan CIP.
Vesting of the PSP award shares is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE-100 and an index based  medicaldevices industry.
Under the CIP, participants can elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares.
If the shares are held for 3 years and the Groups EPSA growth targets are achieved participants receiveanaward ofmatchingshares foreachshare purchased.

Acquisitions Acquisitions in 2004 On 16 March 2004, the Group acquired Midland Medical Technologies MMT, at a net cost of 78.7m in cash and loan notes.
The assets and liabilities acquired are set out below.
There was no material difference between the fairvalue andbookvalue ofnet assets acquired.
For the period 1 May 2003 to 16 March 2004, which was the effective date of acquisition, turnover was 18.6m and the profit after tax of 2.0m comprised 2.9m of operating profit less 0.9m of tax.
There were no other recognised gainsandlosses inthe periodended 16March2004.
In the period since acquisition MMT contributed 16.2m to turnover and 4.1m to profit before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items and generated a net operating cash inflow of 0.2m after capital expenditure of0.5m.

Contingent Liabilities The Group is party to legal proceedings in the normal course of business.
Other than as set out below the Group considers that these will not result in any material adverse effect on the Groups results of operations orfinancialposition.
In August 2003 the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components.
As at that date 2,971 components had been implanted of which approximately 2,471 were in the USA, 450 in Australia and 50 in Europe, the first component having been implanted in December2001.
The product was withdrawn when management became aware of a higher than usual percentage of reports of early revisions revisions are implants which need to be replaced.
Whilst the cause of the revisions remains uncertain it is apparent that some patients do not achieve adequate initial fixation and that in other patients, while there appears to be good initial fixation, this does not persevere.
Extensive testing and modelling has so far failed to identify the precise cause of the failure and, due to the large number of variables involved, itisprobable that the  understoodfully.
As at 31 December 2004 741 implants had been revised and settlements agreed with patients in respect of 491 of these revisions.
The total amount paid out in settlements, legal costs and associated expenses was 45m of which 32m had been or will be recovered from the insurer who provides the primary layer and 65% of the first excess layer in the Groups global product liability programme.
The balance of 13m is due  ofthe balanceofthe first excess layerandthe secondexcess layer.
On 17 December 2004 the Group was notified that % ofthe first and 80% of the second excess layers of the Groups global product liability programme had declined coverage for macrotextured claims.
Management intends to take all steps available to it in order to enforce this coverage.
Nevertheless, in view of the uncertainty, management cannot assert that it is probable that coverage will be restored and consequently has recorded an exceptional charge of 80.0m representing the amount currentlyoutstanding from these insurers and an estimate ofthe costassociated withclaimslikelyto arise in the future assuming that insurance cover is unavailable from these and subsequent excess layer insurers.
Contingent Liabilities continued The charge has been calculated based on: 1 the amount outstanding at 31 December 2004 from the insurers who have denied coverage: 2 an estimate of the average cost in respect of revisions where settlements were unresolved at that date: and 3 an estimate of the number of settlements of future revisions based on the current trend and decaying to zero after five years and an estimation of the average future cost per settlement.
In the hypothetical scenario that all implants eventually need to be revised prematurely and that insurance cover continues to be unavailable, the cost to the Group of the declined insurance cover is estimated to be 190.0m an additional 110.0m over the amount provided, assuming the average costper settlement remainsapproximately the same andthere isa standard rate ofmortality.
The Groups assessment of the impact of these revisions and related matters constitute forward-looking statements that are subject touncertainties,  outcomeofsettlements as compared to the assumptions made in estimating claim amounts.
Smith & Nephew cannot provide assurance that these estimates will prove correct.
Depending on the number and average cost of future settlements, costs maybe greater orless thanthe amountprovided.
Post-Retirement Benefits The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in most of the countriesin whichit has major operating companies.
Pension plans are established under the laws of the relevant country, funded by the payment of contributions to, and the assets held by, separate trust funds or insurance companies.
In those countries where there is no company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered adequate.
Employees retirementbenefits are the subject .
For many years, the Groups major pension plans in the United Kingdom UK Plan and the United States US Plan were of the defined benefit type.
From 2003 all new employees were provided with a defined .
The pension costs for the UK Plan and the US Plan have been determined by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the defined benefit plans approach retirement.
The market related actuarial assumptions at the SSAP 24valuationdates anda breakdownofthe pensioncosts are as follows: Actuarialassumptions: UK Plan US Plan % per annum, except servicelives Increase .............................. 4.3 5.0 Increase inpensions........................................ 2.3 Nil Inflation................................................... 2.3 3.0 Returnoninvestments....................................... 6.8 8.0 Average ............................... 10years 13years Pensioncosts: 2004 2003 2002 million Principaldefined benefit plans inthe UK andthe US: Regular cost............................................... 8.1 8.3 9.8  i................................. 5.9 5.1 1.9 Notionalnet interest ondeficit................................. 1.3 0.8 0.1 15.3 14.2 7.8 Other plans................................................ 10.1 7.4 6.5 25.4 21.6 14.3 i Variations from regular costs arise from the surplus deficit in the two principal plans and are amortised using the percentage of payroll method over the weighted average ofexpected pensionable payrolland remaining service livesofcurrent employees inthe plans.
Post-Retirement Benefits continued At the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations for the purposes of SSAP 24 in September 2002 and December 2003, the aggregate market value of the assets of the UK Plan and the US Plan was 238m 2003 230m: valuations in September and December 2002 representing 81% of plan liabilities for accrued benefits, including allowance for projected future increases in salaries, resulting in a net deficit of 57.2m 2003 78% and a net deficit of 64.5m.
The estimated deficit of these plans at 31 December 2004was 49m 2003 55m.
The contributions made to the UK Plan and the US Plan in the accounting period were 8.6m 2003 8.5m, 2002 2.6m and 9.2m 2003 10.4m, 2002 5.2m, respectively.
The agreed contribution rates for 2005 are 11% of pensionable earnings plus a supplementary payment of 4.3m to the UK Planand9%  a supplementary payment of2.7mtothe US Plan.
Included in debtors due after more than one year are prepayments of 9.7m 2003 7.1m and included in creditors are accruals due within one year of 4.7m 2003 4.0m relating to the funding of certain Grouppensionplans.
The Group recharges the UK pension plan with the costs of administration and independent advisers.
The amount recharged in the year was 0.6m 2003 0.6m, 2002 0.4m.
The costs of providing healthcare benefits after retirement of 1.2m 2003 1.1m, 2002 0.8m are determined by independent qualified actuaries.
The unfunded liability of 9.2m 2003 8.8m in respect of the accrued healthcare benefits is included in provisions.

Holdings of the Parent Companys Own Shares in respect of the Trust are disclosed in Note 27.
The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded by a loan from the Parent Company.
The costs of the Trust are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
A dividend waiver is in place in respect of those shares held under the long-term incentive plan that are yet to vest.
The waiver represents less than1% ofthe total dividends paid.

Related Party Transactions with Joint Venture and Associated Undertaking In the course of normal operations, the Group traded on an arms-length basis with its joint venture BSN Medical from 1 April 2001 and associated undertaking AbilityOne from 27 March 2002 until 12 September 2003.
The aggregated transactions, which have not been disclosed elsewhere in the financial statements, are summarisedbelow: With With With BSN BSN BSN With With Medical Medical Medical AbilityOne AbilityOne 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 million Sales tothe jointventure associate........ 0.5 0.9 6.9 0.1 0.4 Profit loss made onsales............... 0.2 0.4 0.3 0.1 Agencyfees received................... 14.3 18.2 19.0 Management chargesreceived........... 0.7 1.1 1.6 Purchasesfromthe joint venture associate.................... 10.7 12.2 13.2 3.0 5.3 Loss profit made bythe jointventureon purchases.......................... 0.6 0.3 0.1 Interest receivable fromthe jointventure.... 0.4 37.
New Accounting Standards Under European regulation, from 2005 Smith & Nephew is required to publish its financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
This represents a fundamental change in the accounting regimeunderwhichthe Groupwillreportits results.
New Accounting Standards in the UK FRS 17 FRS 17 retirement benefits was issued in November 2000.
Full implementation for UK GAAP purposes is deferred until 1 January 2005.
Some disclosure requirements are effective for periods prior to this deadline.
The standard requires that financial statements reflect at fair value the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and related funding.
Current and past service costs are charged to operating expense in the period in which they are earned, the interest cost on accrued liabilities less expected return on assets is charged as net finance costs and changes in the value of the related assets and liabilities are taken to reserves in the period.
Had FRS 17 been implemented at 31 December 2004, the Group would have reported in respect of its two major pension plans a retirement liability, net of related deferred tax, of 89.1m 2003 86.5m, which compares with 0.5m 2003 1.7m recorded in the balance sheet under the existing rules.
The impact of FRS 17 on retained earnings for 2004 would have been  earningsby88.6m 2003 84.8m Note34.
New Accounting Standards in the US FAS 123 R On 16 December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Statement No.
123 revised 2004 Statement 123 R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FASB Statement No.
Statement 123 R supersedes APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FASB Statement No.
Generally, the approach in Statement 123 R is similar to the approach described inFASB Statement No.
However, Statement 123 R requires all share-based payments to employees, to be recognised in the income statement based on their fair values.
Pro-forma disclosure and the intrinsic value method are no longer alternatives.
Statement 123 R also requires that the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognised compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required .
Statement 123 R must be adopted no later than 1 July 2005.
The Group already adopts the fair-value method of accounting for employee share options for US GAAP reporting purposes and does not anticipate that the adoption of statement 123 R will have a material impact on its results of operations or financial position.
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US The Group accounts are prepared in accordance with UK GAAP which differ in certain respects from US GAAP.
Those differences which have a significant effect on the Groups profit for the financial year and shareholdersfunds are as follows: Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Prior to 1998, goodwill arising on acquisitions was set off against reserves.
On disposal of such businesses, goodwill previously set off against reserves is charged to profit or loss on disposal.
Since 1998, goodwilland other intangible fixed assets purchased by way of acquisition have been capitalised and written off over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under US GAAP, goodwill and other intangible fixed assets purchased prior to 2002 would have been capitalised and amortised over their expected useful lives.
Commencing 2002, goodwill would not be amortised and would be subject to an annual impairment review, whereas other intangibleassets withfinitelives wouldcontinuetobe capitalised andamortised overtheiruseful lives.
Fair value adjustments to goodwill may be made in the first full financial period after acquisition.
Under US GAAP, these may only be made within one year after acquisition.
Thus, any adjustments after this period wouldbe takentothe profitandloss accountforthe year.
Under UK GAAP, purchase consideration contingent on a future event is estimated and included as part of the cost at the date of acquisition.
This estimate is revised each year until the eventual outcome is certain.
Under US GAAP, contingent consideration is not recognised until the contingency is resolved or the amount is determinable.
Upon the resolution of the contingency, the purchase price may be adjusted, resulting in an adjustment togoodwill.
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US continued Joint Venture and Associated Undertaking One of the components of the goodwill in the joint venture is the difference between the fair value of consideration given and the book value of net assets acquired in the joint venture by the Group.
Under US GAAP, thisgainwouldbe  recognised.
The results of the joint venture are included within turnover, operating profit, interest and taxation.
The results of the associated undertaking were included within operating profit, interest and taxation.
Under US GAAP, the Groups share of the after tax profits of the joint venture and associated undertaking would be reflected in the income statement as a single line item and its net investment in the joint venture would be included as a single line item in the balance sheet with the investment in the Groups associated undertaking.
Post-Retirement Benefits Projected benefit liabilities are discounted using long-terminvestment returns and surpluses and deficits are amortised over the employees service lives.
Under US GAAP, pension liabilities would be discounted using corporate bond rates and surpluses and deficits within 10% limits would not be amortised and would thus have no immediate impact on pension costs.
In addition, under US GAAP where the value of plan assets is below the value of the liabilities valued on an accumulated benefit obligation basis, the deficit on this basis wouldbe .
Trade Investments Trade investments are stated in the balance sheet at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value and any movements in provisions are taken to the profit and loss account for the year.
Under US GAAP, listed trade investments would be stated at market value and movements in market value would be  year.
Factoring of Debts Trade debtors are stated in the balance sheet net of non-returnable proceeds received.
Under US GAAP, trade debtors wouldbe stated gross andproceeds receivedwouldbe includedinborrowings.
 and Hedging Activities Derivative instruments in respect of anticipated future transactions, interest rate risks and intragroup equity investments are accounted for as hedges.
Under US GAAP, all derivative instruments including those imbedded in other contracts are recognised as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at their fair values.
US GAAP prescribes requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships and ongoing assessments of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as part of a hedge transaction would be recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on the type of hedge transaction.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting would be  financialyear.
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts Forward foreign exchange contracts in respect of anticipated future transactions are treated as hedges and not marked to market.
Under US GAAP, such contracts would be valued at the forward rates at the balance sheet date and the gains and losses which do not qualify as hedges included in profit for the financial year.
On maturity of the contract the gain loss not recognised to date would be recognised in profit forthe financialyear.
Interest Rate Swaps Interest rate swaps used to fix interest rates on the Groups major exposures are treated as hedges and not marked to market.
Under US GAAP, these swaps would not be treated as hedges, as the requirements to qualify are not met and gains and losses on valuing such contracts at the balance sheet date would be  financialyear.
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US continued Currency Rate Swaps Currency swaps are used to hedge intra Group equity investments.
Realised and unrealised gains losses are not recognised in profit for the year but are recorded as movements in reserves.
Due to the more prescriptive documentary requirements these swaps would not qualify to be treated as hedges under US GAAP and the gains and losses recorded as movements in reserves would be included in the profit for the financial year.
Under UK GAAP receivables and payables on currency swaps are included within debtors and creditors respectively.
Under US GAAP, these swaps would be separately classified into current asset derivatives,  andnon-.
Dividends Dividends are provided in the period to which they relate and, in the case of proposed final dividends, on the basis of proposals by the directors.
Under US GAAP, dividends would be provided for in the accountsfor the periodinwhichtheyare declared.
Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised on most timing differences.
This is generally consistent with US GAAP, except that deferred taxation is provided on goodwill acquired prior to 1998, which has been set off against reserves and on which taxation benefits have been received.
Under US GAAP, as goodwill acquired prior to 1998 would not have been set off against reserves, the deferred taxation provided under UK GAAP would not be required.
Furthermore, under US GAAP, a deferred tax liability would be provided on intangible assets acquired subject to book amortisation where no tax relief is available and a liability would be set up for deferred tax on gains recognised on the sale of assets where potentially taxable gains have been rolled overintoreplacement assets.
Acquired in-ProcessResearch and Development Acquired in-process research and development is not separately identified and therefore forms part of the goodwill arising on acquisition.
Under US GAAP, acquired in-process research and development would be identifiedseparately  profitandloss accountonthe date ofacquisition.
Leases Leases which are classified as operating leases under UK GAAP couldbe capitalised under US GAAP due to different recognitioncriteria.
Capitalised Interest The Group does not capitalise interest incurred in financing fixed asset additions.
Under US GAAP, interest incurred as part of the cost of constructing fixed assets under long-term projects is capitalised and amortised overthe life ofthe asset.
Staff Costs Under UK GAAP, the Group does not accrue for the expected cost of future employee absences such as vacations.
Under US GAAP, the Group accrues for vacation pay when the employee renders service that  tothisbenefit.
Stock based Compensation The Group does not account for the cost of share options whereas it does account for the cost of share awards.
Under US GAAP, the cost of share options is recognised under the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting periods, along with related deferred taxation movements.
Also under US GAAP, the amount of tax deductions for stock based compensation recognised in the profit and loss account is limited to the related FAS 123charge,  incapital.
Discontinued Operations The results of operations arising from discontinued operations are presented in the profit and loss account under the relevant captions and the profit loss on their disposal is reported as a separate line item after operating income and before interest.
Under US GAAP, the results of operations from discontinued operations and the profit loss on their disposal are reported as separate line items immediately before net income.
DifferencesBetween Accounting PrinciplesGenerally Accepted in the UK and US continued Exceptional Items Certain exceptional items are shown on the face of the profit and loss account after operating profit.
These items are mainly gains and losses on the sale of businesses and the cost of fundamental reorganisations.
UnderUS GAAP, these items wouldbe classified as .
Restatement of Prior  UK to US GAAP In the course of preparing to convert the accounts from UK GAAP to IFRS, the Group has identified additional adjustments to its reconciliations to US GAAP.
These adjustments relate to vacation pay accruals and deferred taxation thereon, deferred taxation on gains deferred into replacement assets, deferred taxation on tax deductible goodwill, taxation on stock based compensation and the translational effects of net investment hedging.
As a result US GAAP reconciliations for prior years have been restated.
