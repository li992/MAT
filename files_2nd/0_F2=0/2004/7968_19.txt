This resulted in a further recovery of 1.8m 2003 15.3m and 4.2m 2003 22.2m of associated interest income.
A charge for corporation tax of 0.5m 2003 7.5m has been made in respect of this income.
The goodwill impairment relates to Inchcape Automotive Limited, reflecting the more difficult trading conditions experienced by that business.
In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, the carrying value of Inchcape Automotive Limiteds fixed assets have been compared to their estimated recoverable amount, represented by their value in use to the Group.
This has been derived using cash flow projections discounted at a pre-tax rate of 11.5%.

Inchcape plc Annual report 2004 52 Notes to the accounts continued 5Pensions and other post-retirement benefits aThe Group operates pension schemes for its employees in a number of subsidiaries.
In the UK and Hong Kong, schemes are mainly of the defined benefit type with assets held under trust in separately administered accounts.
Some overseas employees are covered by defined contribution schemes which are principally linked to local statutory arrangements and there are also a number of other minor overseas defined benefit schemes.
The Group also has some unfunded arrangements in the UK, the costs of which are included in the pension cost figures below.
The Group has no health and medical plans providing post-retirement benefits for current employees but does have a liability in respect of past employees under schemes which have been closed to new entrants.
Pensions UK schemes The UK consists of three main defined benefit schemes.
All three schemes pension costs were determined in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries based on the projected unit method.
Open schemes Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme The latest actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 on a market related basis.
The main assumptions are weighted average investment return of 6.1%, salary increase of 4.5% and pension increase of 2.5%.
The market related value of the assets covered 101.4% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future salary increases.
The market value of the assets at the date of the valuation was 120.9m, and the surplus was 1.9m.
The Trustees triennial valuation of the Inchcape Group UK Pension Scheme applies a more conservative discount rate than that used by the Group for SSAP 24 purposes.
The Groups valuation is based on the best estimate of the long term return achievable on each of the schemes investments, in accordance with advice from an independent actuary.
This does not directly impact the future cash contributions to the scheme.
Inchcape Motors Pension Scheme The latest actuarial valuation for this scheme was carried out at 5 April 2003 on a market related basis.
The main assumptions are weighted average investment return of 6.8%, salary increase of 4.5% and pension increase of 2.5%.
The market value of the assets covered 90.7% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future salary increases.
The market value of the assets at the date of the valuation was 89.1m, and the deficit was 9.6m.
The level of contributions has been increased to address this deficit.
Closed scheme TKM Group Pension Scheme The latest actuarial valuation for this closed scheme was carried out at 5 April 2004 on a market related basis.
The main assumptions are weighted average investment return of 5.4% and pension increase of 3.2%.
The market value of the assets covered 102.3% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
The market value of the assets at the date of the valuation was 232.8m, and the surplus was 5.3m.
The scheme has a prudent investment strategy and at 5 April 2004, the scheme had only 0.9% invested in equities.
Inchcape plc Annual report 2004 53 5Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued Pensions Overseas schemes The assets of all overseas schemes had a market value of 98.4m based on the latest actuarial valuations.
This included 80.8m of assets held in the Inchcape Group Overseas Scheme managed from Guernsey.
In note 5b, in line with FRS 17, this scheme is included in the UK segment.
The actuarial assumptions used for overseas schemes were consistent with local practice.
The actuarial valuations of the total assets covered 94.3% of the benefits that had accrued to members.
The net deficit at the time of the valuations totalled 6.0m.
Pension cost The pension cost charged for 2004 was 10.2m 2003 9.3m of which 8.1m 2003 7.5m relates to schemes of a defined benefit nature and 2.1m 2003 1.8m represents the amount attributable to defined contribution schemes.
Provisions of 4.4m 2003 4.5m in relation to defined benefit pension schemes and 2.9m 2003 2.8m in relation to post-retirement health and medical benefits are included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
Outstanding contributions to defined contribution schemes are 0.1m 2003 0.2m.
b Disclosures under FRS 17 for the year ended 31 December 2004 The Group continues to report pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24.
However, the Group is following the extended transitional arrangements under which additional disclosure on retirement benefits is required in the notes to the financial statements under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
These disclosures are set out below.
The principal retirement and defined benefit schemes operated by the Group are in the UK and Hong Kong.
The most recent actuarial valuations of these schemes have been updated by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004.
In addition the Group operates a number of other minor defined benefit pension schemes overseas which due to their immaterial nature are excluded from the FRS 17 disclosures set out below.
With the pending abolition of the Minimum Funding Requirement and amendments to pension legislation in 2004 introducing new powers to seek additional funding from the sponsoring group, the TKM pension scheme has been included in the UK segment for the purposes of the FRS 17 disclosures as at 31 December 2004.
This has resulted in an increase in the market value of assets and present value of pension liabilities at 31 December 2004 of 239.2m and 214.9m respectively.
Given the closed nature of the scheme, the Group has treated the resultant 24.3m surplus as irrecoverable to the Group.

There is no tax on other exceptional items 2003 nil.
Of the 7.5m tax relating to last years VAT recovery, 4.9m has been transferred from deferred tax to current tax this year.
Of the Headline deferred tax credit, 2.4m 2003 3.5m has arisen from the origination and reversal of timing differences.
A credit of 0.4m 2003 0.3m has arisen due to adjustments to the estimated recoverable amount of deferred tax arising in prior years.
All of the deferred tax charge on the VAT recovery has arisen from the origination of timing differences.
b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The effective tax rate for the year of 32.2% 2003 22.7% is higher than the standard rate of tax.
The standard rate comprises the average rates of tax payable across the Group, weighted in proportion to accounting profits.
2004 2003 m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 155.3 168.3 Profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of tax 23.6% 2003 26.2% 36.7 44.1 Effects of: untaxed FRS 3 provision releases 2.5 1.2 non-deductible goodwill 6.8 1.4 untaxed profits 0.3 0.5 losses brought forward utilised in year 1.8 4.4 unrelieved losses 2.4 2.3 permanent disallowable items 5.3 5.5 prior year items 2.7 4.0 short term timing differences 8.5 3.9 accelerated capital allowances 2.4 1.0 other items 0.1 Total current tax charge 50.0 38.2 Inchcape plc Annual report 2004 59 8Taxation continued c Factors that may affect future tax charges The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of c. 25.0m 2003 c. 21.0m that may improve the tax rate in future years.
The majority of these relate to losses, mainly arising in the UK, with the balance relating to accelerated capital allowances and other short term timing differences.
These assets are not recognised because they arise in statutory entities that are currently not forecast to make taxable profits.
There are further potential deferred tax assets, relating to losses, of c. 14.0m 2003 c. 17.0m that are not recognised and are not considered to have any impact on the future tax charge because the possibility of accessing them is considered so remote.
These assets will only become recognisable if the relevant companies which hold them generate sufficient taxable profits.
There are also losses in Belgium for which an asset of 1.7m 2003 1.6m has been recognised, based on current forecast profits.
A further asset of 0.4m 2003 1.1m will only become recognisable if the relevant company which holds them generates sufficient taxable profits.
No deferred tax has been recognised for gains arising on revaluing properties to market value.
The total unrecognised amount is 1.4m 2003 1.4m.
Such tax would become payable only if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
At present, it is not envisaged that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.

These are not separable products.
The warranty periods covered are up to six years and or specific mileage limits.
Provision is made for the expected cost of labour and parts based on historical claims experience and expected future trends.
These assumptions are reviewed regularly.
Motors business exits During 2004, the Group became committed to business exits and terminations which resulted in the charge of 5.8m 2003 3.0m to the profit and loss account.
These included the Ferrari exits, as set out in note 6.
These business exits will largely be completed over the next two years.
Non-motors business exits Provision has been made for warranties, indemnities and other litigation issues in relation to these exits, based on expected outcomes.
These provisions arise from the exits of businesses prior to the transformation of the Group to a purely automotive services group.
The exits were all completed by late 1999.
Any detailed disclosure of these outstanding claims could seriously prejudice negotiations.
Accordingly, no information is given in regard to the likely timing or cash impact as normally required under FRS 12 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
They are however referred to in note 22.
Vacant leasehold The Group is committed to certain leasehold premises for which it no longer has a commercial use.
These are principally located in the UK.
Provision has been made to the extent of the estimated future net cost.
This includes taking into account existing subtenant arrangements.
In determining the provision, the cash flows have been discounted on a pre-tax basis using appropriate government bond rates.
The charge for the unwinding of the discount of 0.2m 2003 0.2m has been included in the interest charge in the profit and loss account.
Other The provision includes the cost of implementing new European Block Exemption contracts throughout the dealer network in Belgium and a number of litigation provisions that have been reclassified from creditors.
These are expected to be settled within the next four years.

The Company is party to composite cross guarantees between banks and its subsidiaries.
The Companys contingent liability under these guarantees at 31 December 2004 was 16.5m 2003 21.7m.
Commitments for capital expenditure entered into and not provided for in these accounts amount to 8.0m 2003 0.3m.
The Group also has, in the ordinary course of business, commitments under foreign exchange instruments relating to the hedging of transactional exposures note 29e.
Aon Corporation Aon has made certain claims under an indemnity given in connection with the sale of Bain Hogg Limited in 1996 relating to liabilities in respect of advice given on the sale of pensions and related products, opt outs and transfers by Bain Hogg Financial Services Limited and Gardner Mountain Financial Services Limited.
Aon may seek to make further claims in respect of such advice and related costs.
On the information currently available to the Company, it is not possible to assess fully the merits or value of claims under this indemnity.
The Directors have taken legal advice and are pursuing all options open to them to defend or minimise the claims.
At 31 December 2004, there were other contingent liabilities arising in the ordinary course of business, including those in respect of disposed businesses.
The Directors have reviewed the above matters and have made certain provisions.
Having done so, the Directors consider, based on the information currently available, that they will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
In September 2000, the European Parliament passed Directive 2000 53 EC which deals with the collection and disposal of vehicles at the end of their life.
The Directive includes a retrospective liability for vehicles put on the road prior to July 2002.
Member states were required to enact legislation by 21 April 2002.
Belgium, Finland and Greece have enacted legislation.
In Belgium and Greece there are self-funding arrangements in place with independent companies which will result in a no cost solution for importers.
The same is expected to be the case in Finland.
The other member states where the Group operates are expected to pass or are in the course of passing legislation in the near future which may or may not give rise to a liability for the Group.
The Directors have reviewed this matter and, based on the information currently available, consider that implementation of the Directive will not have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.

Inchcape plc Annual report 2004 75 29 Financial instruments An outline of the objectives, policies and strategies pursued by the Group in relation to financial instruments is set out in the Treasury management and policy section of the Financial review.
For the purpose of the disclosures which follow in this note except for exchange risk management disclosures in note 29b, short term debtors and creditors which arise directly from the Groups operations have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments which play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk profile of the Group.
An analysis of the carrying value of these financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table in note 29c.

The US dollar exposures in aggregate of 0.9m in 2004 2003 0.7m principally relate to US dollar trade receivables payables within the businesses in Peru and Chile, where the majority of sales and purchases are in US dollars.
Other exposures are principally minor unhedged transactions which are settled within a short time period.
This minimises exchange rate risk and the need to hedge the exposure.

Their fair value has been calculated by discounting the expected cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
In substance the vehicles remain the assets of the Group and have been included in stock at the guaranteed repurchase price less appropriate provisions where realisable value is lower, with the corresponding cross guaranteed repurchase liability within trade creditors.
The asset side of this transaction is not recorded in the previous table because it does not qualify as a financial asset as defined by FRS 13.
Forward foreign exchange contracts The fair value of contracts of 8.3m represents the difference between the value of the outstanding contracts at their contracted rates and a valuation calculated using the spot rates of exchange prevailing at 31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2004 the Group had nominal amounts outstanding of 419.6m 2003 417.1m for these contracts, used principally to hedge future purchases in foreign currency.
