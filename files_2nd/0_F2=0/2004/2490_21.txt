17 Segmental analysis A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment and the Groups geographical segments form the focus of the Groups internal reporting systems.
The Group is a single product business providing cigarettes and other tobacco products.
While the Group has clearly differentiated brands, global segmentation between a wide portfolio of brands is not part of the regular internally reported financial information.
It is not feasible to segment global results without a high degree of estimation, especially given that geographically the same operations are used to produce the different brands and brand results are managed in the context of the geographic markets in which they are sold.
The prices agreed between Group companies for intra group sales of materials, manufactured goods, charges for royalties, commissions, services and fees are based on normal commercial practices which would apply between independent businesses.
Royalty income, less related expenditure, is included in the region in which the licensor is based.

Below, we look at some examples of markets where we are achieving growth, sometimes against the odds.
Our four global drive brands have played an important role in our recent growth and as usual, we report on them later in this Review.
2004 was a year when our plans to improve productivity really started to make a significant impact and we have provided some examples of how we are reducing our overheads and supply chain costs.
As we manufacture products that can be harmful to the health of our consumers, one of the aims at the core of our responsibility strategy is to reduce harm to meet both consumer needs and reasonable societal expectations.
We summarise some of our work in this area.
Venezuela Its no understatement to describe the Venezuelan market as an extremely challenging political and business climate.
In recent years, the economy has seen major currency devaluations, the imposition of exchange controls and high levels of ination and unemployment.
In 2004, the country experienced a Presidential recall referendum, social unrest and deterioration in public institutions and national security.

BAT Review Insert 15 3 2005 8:05 am Page 4 The market The Russian tobacco market is a vibrant and fast-moving one.
Since the economic crisis of 1998, consumers economic stability has increased and they have continued to trade-up in their choice of a range of consumer goods, including tobacco.
To ensure that BAT Russia takes advantage of this development, we have recognised the importance of building strong relationships with retailers across the Russian market, no mean feat in the largest country in the world covering 11 time zones.
Today, BAT Russia does business in over 150 cities across Russia, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok.
BAT Russia led the introduction of such innovations as the implementation of stock delivery directly to retail outlets and loyalty programmes, among other incentives, which rewarded retailers for increased availability, visibility and sales of our brands.
This gives the Company more inuence over important issues such as pricing, availability and stock levels.
BAT Russia has maintained its lead at the forefront of retailer relationship innovation by the introduction in 2003 of a series of BAT Academies retailer training programmes which focused not on tobacco sales but topics of more general business interest such as category management, staff motivation and negotiating skills.
These programmes were extremely well received by the approximately 3,000 strategic retailers who attended the events.

During 2004, our HORECA team almost doubled in size and the amount of HORECA clients virtually trebled against 2003.
