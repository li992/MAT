b For the basis of the calculations of combined earnings per share see note 7 on page 112. c At 31 December 2000, capital and reserves, restated for the pensions changes described on page 150, would have been 11 211 million.
d Lease-adjusted net debt includes five times operating lease costs to reect fully the various nancing options adopted.
e In the calculation for 2001, taxation is reduced by 430 million relating to tax paid on a disposal in the US.
f During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever recognised for US GAAP reporting purposes SFAS 142 which ceased amortisation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.
Amortisation expense on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on a US GAAP basis for the years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000 were 1 748 million and 810 million respectively.
g During the year ended 31 December 2002, Unilever changed its method of calculating expected return on plan assets for US GAAP purposes by adopting the actual fair market value at the balance sheet date rather than a market-related value.
Had this methodology been applied in previous years, it would have resulted in an increase in net income for the years ended 31 December 2001 and 2000 of 86 million and 210 million respectively.
