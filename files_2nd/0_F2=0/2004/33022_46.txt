The prior period adjustment in respect of UK taxation relates to the settlement of a number of tax issues covering several accounting periods including merger costs, divestment provisions and fixed asset valuations.

To the extent that dividends remitted from overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided for.

Cumulative unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and related undertakings totalled approximately $11,073m at 31 December 2004 2003 $9,381m.
Unremitted earnings may be liable to overseas taxes and or UK taxation after allowing for double taxation relief if they were to be distributed as dividends.
