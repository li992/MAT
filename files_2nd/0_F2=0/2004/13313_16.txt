SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The analysis of turnover is based on the country in which the order is received and would not be materially different if based on the continued country in which the customer is located.
Turnover from franchisees and from an associate in Asia have been included to reflect the involvement by management in these businesses.
Interest is managed by the central treasury function and therefore it is not considered appropriate to analyse this by segment.

HOLDING COMPANY Under s. 230 of the Companies Act 1985 a profit and loss account for the company alone is not presented.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Rentokil Initial Employee Share Trust for UK Employees note 24 where dividends have been waived.
For adjusted earnings per share, the profit attributable to shareholders is adjusted for the exceptional items note 3, and is presented to reflect the ongoing performance of the group.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The company has only one category of dilutive potential shares, being those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys shares during the year.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill at 1st January 195.7 Exchange adjustments 0.9 Businesses acquired note 31 28.9 Impairment losses note 3 14.4 Consideration adjustment to an acquisition made in 2000 16.4 Goodwill at 31st December 192.9 Under the provisions of the accounting policy set out on pages 48 and 49, goodwill is carried as an intangible asset on the balance sheet.
The directors have reviewed these acquisitions and have determined that, as service businesses which are not subject to high volatility in fashions or markets, demand for these services is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.
Hence neither the value of these businesses nor the associated goodwill have a measurable useful economic life and the goodwill is therefore not being amortised.
The useful economic lives and values of the businesses and goodwill were re-assessed as at 31st December 2004.
The impairment of goodwill was made following the deterioration in performance experienced during the year in six businesses, namely US Tropical Plants 9.8m, German Hospital Services 3.6m and four other businesses in the Hygiene and Facilities Management sectors, mainly in Asia Pacific & Africa 1.0m.
Value-in-use calculations were used to determine the amount of the impairment using risk-adjusted interest rates ranging from 10% to 11%.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS The consideration adjustment to an acquisition made in 2000 was made following a detailed review of the goodwill balance in continued preparation for transition to IFRS.
This review revealed that the consideration and goodwill in respect of one acquisition made in 2000 necessitated an adjustment.
The position has been corrected through the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses to be consistent with the original accounting.

DEBTORS continued The convertible loan note was received in 2000 as part consideration for the disposal of a business note 20.
The classification of the loan note as a debtor due after more than one year reflects the continuing intention to hold the loan note to maturity in 2008 and the likelihood that the equity conversion option will not be exercised.
The pension scheme prepayments reflect the difference between contributions paid and pension costs charged to date.
Included within other debtors falling due after more than one year is a ZAR220.6m 17.6m 2003: nil loan note received in 2004 as deferred consideration from the disposal of a 25.1% interest in the South African business note 32.

Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments together with other outgoings, after taking into account existing sub-tenant arrangements and assumptions relating to later periods of vacancy.
It is expected that the provision will be utilised over the remaining head lease period up to 2020.
Environmental The group owns a number of properties in the UK, Europe and the USA where there is land contamination and provisions are held for the remediation of such contamination.
Utilisation of the provision is estimated to be made over the next 25 years.
Self insurance The company purchases external insurance from a portfolio of international insurers for its key insurable risks in order to limit the maximum potential loss that the company could suffer in any one year.
Individual claims are met in full by the company up to agreed self insured limits in order to limit volatility in claims.
The utilisation period of this provision is difficult to determine as claims are rolled forward each year.
The calculated cost of self insurance claims, based on an actuarial assessment of claims incurred at the balance sheet date, is accumulated as claims provisions.
The annual review of these provisions by external actuaries resulted in an increase in the reserves and in the insurance charge to the profit and loss account in the year of 3.1m 2003: 1.1m.
Other provisions Other provisions principally comprise amounts required to cover obligations arising, warranties given and costs relating to disposed businesses.
This includes the provision made in respect of product supply by a discontinued business note 3.

Other debtors include a balance of 143.4m 2003: 143.0m in respect of a convertible loan note issued by Ashtead Group plc Ashtead in partial consideration for their purchase of our former US plant services business.
The note has a final maturity date of 31st March 2008 and interest accrues at 5.25% per annum.
At 31st December 2004 9.4m 2003: 9.0m of this balance is represented by accrued interest.
During 2004 Ashtead announced that it successfully completed both the refinancing of its senior secured bank credit facilities and then issued a 10 year 120m high yield bond in the capital markets.
Ashtead stated that in taking such actions they had refinanced approximately 75% of their debt during 2004 and extended their debt maturities to 5.5 years.
The new $675m asset based senior syndicated loan facility is committed to November 2009 subject only to the convertible loan note being repaid prior to November 2007.
As a result of the above refinancing arrangements, certain consequential amendments were made to the terms of the convertible note.
As a result of these amendments, Ashtead agreed to pay the noteholder, BET Ltd, 3.5m of accrued interest for the period of 1st October 2003 to 16th April 2004 on 16th April 2004.
In addition it was agreed that all other previously deferred interest, totalling 7.4m, would become payable at the earlier of the note repayment date or 31st March 2008.
Interest will accrue on this deferred interest sum at the Barclays Bank PLC UK base rate plus 2%.
The original note principal amount, maturity date and interest rate have been unchanged by these amendments.
The noteholder has also subsequently received 3.5m of interest on its normal due dates in October 2004 and April 2005, together with a 2m fee in November 2004 upon the full refinancing of Ashteads senior secured debt.
On 15th March 2005, Ashtead announced its interim results for the nine months to 31st January 2005 and updated the market on its trading prospects.
These indicated that the company had performed strongly in the third quarter and that trading conditions in all its markets remained good.
Since their latest trading announcement, the Ashtead share price has risen from 99.75p to 105.20p as at the latest practical date prior to the publication of this report.
In accordance with FRS 13 disclosure requirements, a fair value of 124.9m 2003: 114.6m has been ascribed to the convertible note.
This has been calculated after discounting the cash flows of the note in accordance with the conditions prevailing at 31st December 2004 at the then market interest rates and after due adjustments for credit risk.
Included within the 2004 fair value sum is an amount of 4.6m which has been ascribed to the equity conversion option 2003: nil.
This sum has been calculated using recognised market option pricing methodology, an Ashtead share price as at 31st December 2004 of 77.25p 2003: 15.5p, and historic share price volatility data.
The company has noted the gradually improving trading outlook of Ashtead, together with the positive refinancing actions that have been undertaken during 2004.
The company will continue to monitor any further announcements by Ashtead and take any actions as may be required in the future to protect the noteholders legal rights.
Also included within other debtors is a ZAR220.6m 17.6m loan note that was received in 2004 as deferred consideration from the disposal of a 25.1% interest in the South African business note 32.
This loan note currently bears interest at a variable rate of 9.5% pa, a rate that will vary over time with movements in the South African prime interest rates.
It is anticipated that the loan will be repaid over a period of 10 years.
DERIVATIVES AND Debtors include 20.6m 2003: 1.9m of interest bearing and 1.5m 2003: 2.5m of non interest bearing notes and deferred OTHER FINANCIAL consideration received in respect of non-core business disposals.
The notes deferred consideration have final maturities between INSTRUMENTS continued 2005 and 2008, although earlier repayments may be precipitated under the terms of the respective disposal notes sale agreements.
The group does utilise foreign currency short term and long term borrowings to hedge overseas acquisitions and investments.
Any differences between the book values and the fair values for these borrowings are shown on page 61.
Currency exposures As explained in the Finance Directors Review on pages 14 and 15, the groups currency borrowings including those held in its main operating businesses are used to hedge the exchange effects arising from the retranslation of its net overseas investments.
Gains and losses arising on net overseas investments and the currency borrowings used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses in accordance with SSAP 20.
The groups businesses provide goods and services in their local economies, sourced predominately from the local economies.
As a consequence the groups businesses do not have any material transactional currency exposures nor any material foreign currency assets or liabilities by reference to their reporting currencies.
Such foreign exchange differences which do arise on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group companies and the group 2004: nil, 2003: nil.
Hedges Other than the gains and losses on net interest rate and currency swaps noted in the fair value table on page 61, there are no material unrecognised or deferred gains or losses at either year-end in respect of financial instruments used as hedges.

PENSION The group operates a number of pension schemes around the world covering many of its employees.
The major schemes are of the COMMITMENTS defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The principal scheme in the United Kingdom is the Rentokil Initial Pension Scheme, which has a number of defined benefit sections which are now closed to new entrants, and a defined contribution section.
Actuarial valuations of the UK scheme are carried out every three years.
The most recent actuarial valuation was at 1st April 2002.
It was carried out using the projected unit credit method and the principal assumptions made by the independent professional actuary were that pensions would increase by either 2.7% per annum or 3.6% per annum, pensionable salaries would increase by 3.8% per annum and pensions would be discounted back to the valuation date using discount rates of 6.7% per annum for the period after retirement and 7.2% per annum for the period before retirement.
The market value of the schemes assets totalled 613.9m as at 1st April 2002.
However, for the purposes of the valuation, the assets were adjusted by 55.6m to reflect the underperformance of the schemes actual investments relative to a portfolio of bonds over the preceding three years.
The combined value of the assets and the above smoothing adjustment represented 115% of the value of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in pensionable salaries and pensions.
In light of the results of the 2002 actuarial valuation, the company resumed contributions to the defined benefit sections of the scheme with effect from March 2004.
A contribution of 6.8m was made in March 2004 and a further 9.3m in March 2005.
Future contributions will be known once the 2005 triennial actuarial valuation has been completed.
The world wide pension cost for the group was 14.9m 2003: 15.2m, of which 3.8m 2003: 4.5m related to the groups total UK pension cost, which was calculated using the same assumptions as above.
The above UK pension cost makes allowance for a credit of 4.9m in respect of experience surpluses that are being recognised over 11 years, the average future service lives of employees in the scheme.
There is a prepayment of 17.9m see note 14 in the groups balance sheet 2003: 14.9m in respect of the UK scheme resulting from the difference between contributions paid and pension costs charged to date.
The additional disclosures required under FRS 17 are shown below.
These relate only to the main UK scheme but they would not be materially different if they included the defined benefit schemes which operate in other countries.
The numbers shown in this disclosure have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation of the UK scheme as at 1st April 2002, updated by an independent qualified actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31st December 2004.
