61 Notes to the accounts 3i Report and accounts 2004 32 Interest rate sensitivity gap analysis Interest rate risk emanates from the Groups loan investments and the Groups funding.
The Groups policy is that fixed rate lending is matched with fixed rate borrowings and the interest rate resetting profile of variable rate lending is matched with that of variable rate borrowings through gearing the portfolio.
Financial instruments including interest rate swaps are used as part of this matching process.
Equity investments, which are mainly funded by shareholders funds but also partially by borrowings in similar currencies, give rise to an interest rate sensitivity gap as a result of the equity investments being non-interest bearing and having no fixed maturity date.
The interest rate sensitivity gap at 31 March 2004 was: More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Loans and advances to banks 419 65 50 534 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 244 40 284 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 424 39 59 301 489 1,312 Fixed income shares 150 150 Equity shares 2,864 2,864 Other assets 267 267 1,087 144 109 301 490 3,281 5,412 Liabilities Deposits by banks 215 215 Debt securities in issue 174 24 21 388 917 1,128 Convertible bonds 367 367 Other liabilities 262 262 Subordinated liabilities 45 45 Shareholders funds 3,395 3,395 41 24 21 755 962 3,657 5,412 Interest rate sensitivity gap 1,046 168 88 454 472 376 Cumulative gap 1,046 1,214 1,302 848 376 More than More than More than three months six months one year but not but not but not Not more than more than more than more than More than Non-interest three months six months one year five years five years bearing Total 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 Assets m m m m m m m Treasury bills and other eligible bills 1 1 Loans and advances to banks 412 105 10 527 Debt securities held for treasury purposes 228 55 283 Debt securities and other fixed income securities held as financial fixed assets Loan investments 438 67 65 328 438 1,336 Fixed income shares 228 228 Equity shares 2,375 2,375 Other assets 249 249 1,078 227 75 328 439 2,852 4,999 Liabilities Deposits by banks 316 104 3 423 Debt securities in issue 44 126 34 302 1,000 1,350 Convertible bonds Other liabilities 239 239 Subordinated liabilities 51 51 Shareholders funds 2,936 2,936 272 230 31 302 1,051 3,175 4,999 Interest rate sensitivity gap 806 3 106 26 612 323 Cumulative gap 806 803 909 935 323 62 Notes to the accounts 3i Report and accounts 2004 33 Currency exposures Currency rate risk emanates from the Groups international operations.
The policy regarding currency risk is set out in the Operating and financial review on page 23.
Currency swaps are used as part of applying that policy.
The Groups structural currency exposures at 31 March 2004 were as follows: Variable Fixed Other Other net Short-term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 341 429 1,622 721 60 223 1,132 2,264 Euro 102 256 862 28 72 60 595 785 US dollar 32 47 268 7 120 234 Swiss franc 41683 21 91 Swedish krona 152 185 26 133 144 13 Other 11417 12 13 34 Subtotal 135 407 1,424 71 214 84 608 1,131 Total 476 836 3,046 792 154 139 1,740 3,395 Variable Fixed Other Other net Short-term Other rate loan rate loan investment assets before variable rate variable rate Fixed rate investments investments assets borrowings borrowings borrowings borrowings Net assets 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 2003 Currency m m m m m m m m Sterling 397 496 1,450 688 14 200 1,244 2,001 Euro 91 181 656 69 113 42 259 667 US dollar 37 62 221 10 32 298 Swiss franc 38 26 2 25 41 Swedish krona 1 20 217 20 354 96 Other 13 61 4 39 14 25 Subtotal 129 314 1,181 105 209 312 273 935 Total 526 810 2,631 793 195 112 1,517 2,936 34 Liquidity The Groups liquidity policy is based on a maturity ladder approach with all mismatch limits of cash flows between cumulative assets and cumulative liabilities over various time periods approved by the Board.
The limits for shorter periods are also agreed with the Financial Services Authority.
35 Fair value of financial assets and financial liabilities The Group does not have a trading book and it holds all assets and liabilities in a non-trading book.
Financial assets Quoted and unquoted equity investments and quoted fixed income shares are included in the consolidated balance sheet at market value or Directors valuation which equates to fair value.
Unquoted fixed income shares and loan investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
No liquid and active market exists, either for the unquoted fixed income share or loan investments or their component parts.
The fair value of other financial assets equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Financial liabilities The Groups borrowings finance loan investments, fixed income shares and equity shares.
As stated above, these unquoted loan and fixed income share investments are included in the consolidated balance sheet at the lower of cost or recoverable amount.
These investments are not shown at an estimated market value as no active and liquid market exists for them.
The Report and accounts therefore do not include any recognition of the effect of their yield being above or below current market yields.
However, Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures requires disclosure of the fair value of those elements of the Groups borrowings that are listed even though, in some cases, the market for those borrowings is not particularly active.
The remainder of the Groups borrowings, which are unlisted, do not have a liquid or active market.
The fair value of the listed element of financial liabilities at 31 March 2004 was 1,424 million 2003: 1,214 million, which compares with a book amount of 1,367 million 2003: 1,205 million.
These borrowings are used to fund investments which, in general, yield a net margin to the Group and which would therefore have a higher fair value than the fair value of the borrowing.
The fair value of other financial liabilities equates to their book value in the consolidated balance sheet.
Derivatives The Group does not trade in derivatives.
The derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging.
It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The book value of derivatives represents net interest receivable payable on such instruments at the balance sheet date.
The fair value represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date.
No unrealised gains or losses are included in the balance sheet.
The amount of unrecognised gains or losses at the balance sheet date equates to the difference between fair value and book value.
