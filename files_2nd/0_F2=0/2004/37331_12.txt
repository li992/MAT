LAND SECURITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2004 66 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2004 Pensions The charge to profit and loss account for pension costs during the year is made up as follows: 2004 2003 m m Regular pension cost 3.3 3.2 Variations from regular cost 2.3 3.2 Other schemes 4.2 3.6 Net pension amount 9.8 10.0 The amount under other schemes includes the actual contributions paid to the Groups defined contribution schemes and, in respect of 2003, sums paid to the BBC scheme as required under the terms of the participation in the BBC scheme in the period to 31 March 2003.
This is due to the Land Securities Trillium outsourcing arrangement with the BBC.
Defined benefit scheme Land Securities Scheme The Pension & Assurance Scheme of the Land Securities Group of Companies the Scheme is the most significant defined benefit pension scheme of the Group.
The Scheme, which is closed to new entrants and which is non-contributory for employees, provides defined benefits based on final pensionable salary.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a self-administered trust fund which is separate from the Groups assets.
Contributions to the Scheme are determined by a qualified independent actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
As the Scheme is closed to new members, the current service cost will be expected to increase as a percentage of salary, under the projected unit method, as members approach retirement.
The last formal actuarial valuation, undertaken for the purposes of setting the ongoing contribution rate, was carried out as at 1 July 2003.
At valuation 1 7 2003 % The key assumptions adopted for this valuation were as follows: Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.75 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.50 Discount rate Prior to retirement 6.00 In retirement 5.00 Inflation 2.50 Actuarial value of assets % of market value 95.00 The deficit in the Scheme has increased from 1.2m as at 6 April 2001 to 22.0m as at 1 July 2003 and this decline has been reflected in the FRS17 figures disclosed in previous years.
This increase is primarily due to the sharp fall in equity markets over that period a fall of some 20% and an increase in life expectancy that has been revealed by recent industry investigations.
The market value of the Schemes invested assets excluding the value of annuities purchased to provide certain pensions in payment as at 1 July 2003 was 65.5m.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 79% of the value of the Schemes liabilities at that date.
As a result of this valuation, the actuary recommended that the employer contributions of 30% of pensionable salary be continued together with additional employer contributions to address the deficit.
In order to address the deficit in the Scheme, the Group made an additional one-off cash contribution of 7.5m in March 2003 together with the first payment of an additional annual contribution of 1.5m recommended by the Schemes actuary.
A further annual contribution of 1.5m was made in March 2004.
The 7.5m contribution paid in March 2003 is being amortised and charged to the profit and loss account over 10 years, the estimated remaining service life of the Schemes active members.
The pension charges in 2003 and 2004 reflect the amortisation and the 1.5m additional annual contributions as variations from regular costs.
Employer contributions will continue at 30% of pensionable salaries until completion of the next formal valuation, due no later than 1 July 2006.
In addition, discussions are under way between the Trustees of the Scheme and the Group about the level of additional contributions that are required to address the deficit revealed in the 1 July 2003 valuation.
Trillium Plan The Group participated in the BBC pension scheme until 31 March 2003 in respect of 168 employees who transferred from the BBC to Land Securities Trillium Media Services Limited as part of the Land Securities Trilliums outsourcing contracts with the BBC.
With effect from 1 April 2003, Land Securities Trillium Media Services Limited put in place a defined benefit scheme with the same terms and conditions as the BBC pension scheme for the employees who transferred from the BBC the Trillium Plan.
As at 31 March 2004 the Trillium Plan had assets of 11.1m.
This includes a bulk transfer payment of 8.1m that is expected to be received in due course from the BBC pension scheme.
As part of the PRIME agreement, the Group is obliged to provide pension benefits under a now closed funded defined benefit scheme applicable to less than 20 employees.
This scheme is included within the Trillium Plan.
The assets and liabilities in respect of the Trillium Plan have been included in the consolidated FRS17 disclosure below.
Contributory money purchase scheme A contributory money purchase scheme was introduced on 1 January 1999 for all new administrative and senior property based employees, subject to eligibility, together with a separate similar scheme, effective 1 April 1998, for other property based employees.
A further separate similar scheme, previously set up by Trillium, is also in operation for Land Securities Trillium employees.
Other schemes Land Securities Trillium Telecom Services Limited has put in place a defined benefit pension scheme with the same terms and conditions as the BT scheme for 333 staff who transferred from BT to the scheme from 1 May 2002.
All relevant pension costs are rechargeable to Telereal Services Limited.
There are also certain historic unfunded pensions being paid to three former directors of Land Securities PLC or their dependants in accordance with their service contracts.
All death-in-service and benefits for incapacity arising during employment provided by the Group are wholly insured.
No post retirement benefits other than pensions are made available to employees of the Group.

In calculating the tax charge on revenue profits, the deferred tax arising on capital allowances in respect of investment properties has been eliminated because experience has shown that these allowances are not in practice repayable.
Because capitalised interest on the development programme is becoming increasingly significant, and it is a permanent timing difference, the deferred taxation arising on capitalised interest is also now eliminated when calculating adjusted earnings per share.
Following the recalculation of the adjusted earnings on the revised basis described above, it became apparent that the calculation of the adjusted earnings per share for the six months ended 30 September 2003 required revision.
The revised figures are set out below.

In addition, the deferred tax on capitalised interest on these properties is added back as this is a permanent timing difference.
This is a change to the basis of calculation and the prior year figures have been restated accordingly.

LAND SECURITIES ANNUAL REPORT 2004 72 Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2004 The classification of properties between portfolio management and the development programme is defined in the Glossary page 98.
Operating properties are carried at depreciated cost and are not revalued.
The historical cost of investment properties is 4,589.5m 2003: 4,577.9m.
Proposed developments are excluded from the development programme as experience has shown that these schemes can be subject to substantial revision.
In addition to the development programme, investment properties include properties to the value of 179.3m 2003: 180.5m in respect of proposed developments.
Developments are transferred out of the development programme when physically complete and 95% let.
Schemes completed during the year include The Bullring Birmingham, Kingsway West Phase 1 Dundee, Portman House London W1, 7 Soho Square London W1 and 25 31 Sidwell Street Exeter.
The total development profit earned on schemes completed in the year was 82.7m 2003: 24.3m.
This comprises development profits on those properties completed during the first half of 78.8m plus a further uplift in the second half on those properties of 22.4m offset by losses on those projects completed in the second half of 18.5m.

Financial assets and liabilities This note should be read in conjunction with the comments set out in the OFR on page 34.
The Group has defined financial assets and liabilities as those assets and liabilities of a financial nature, namely cash, investments, borrowings and interest rate swaps.
All the Groups financial assets and liabilities are either sterling based or have been swapped into sterling and, with the exception of the committed bank facilities and commercial paper, are at fixed rates.
The Groups financial assets and liabilities and their fair values are: Excess of fair value Book value Fair value over book value 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m m m Financial assets Short term investments and cash 241.8 102.1 241.8 102.1 Financial liabilities Debentures, bonds, other loans and overdrafts 2,677.6 2,688.7 3,249.1 3,204.9 571.5 516.2 Non-equity B shares 8.4 30.3 8.4 30.3 Redeemable preference shares 0.1 0.1 Financial instruments Interest rate swaps 44.5 82.3 44.5 82.3 2,444.2 2,617.0 3,060.2 3,215.5 616.0 598.5 short term investments and cash include 154.0m 2003: nil of short term deposits charged as temporary security for borrowings as disclosed in Note 17 Financial liabilities 2004 2003 Weighted average period of fixed interest rates 12.4 years 13.3 years Weighted average fixed interest rate 7.3% 7.9% Fair value has been calculated by taking the market value, for those instruments which have a listing, or where one is not available, the fair value is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach.
The difference between book value and fair value will not result in any change to the cash flows of the Group unless, at some stage in the future, fixed rate borrowings are purchased in the market, or repaid, at a price different to the nominal value.
The Group has entered into a number of interest rate swaps in the name of Land Securities PLC.
Land Securities PLC has interest rate swaps with a nominal value of 800.0m upon which it pays a fixed rate of interest and receives six month LIBOR, all of which are operational.
The interest rate swaps terminate between April 2007 and September 2030, and have fixed interest rates of between 4.999% and 5.585%.
Land Securities PLC has a further interest rate swap with a nominal value of 200.0m upon which it receives a fixed rate of interest of 4.895% and pays six month LIBOR.
This interest rate swap was entered into in March 2004 with a commencement date of 25 March 2004 and a termination date of April 2007.
In the case of four 100m fixed rate payer swaps, the counterparties have a right to terminate the swaps mid-life.
In December 2003, Land Securities PLC novated a swap with a nominal value of 100.0m to Trillium Prime Property GP Limited, a related Group company.
The swap was repriced and reprofiled to match the expected amortisation of the project finance debt, which it is hedging.
The current nominal value of the swap is 78.7m and the Group is paying interest at 4.975%.
As the intention of the above interest rate swaps is to fix the interest rates on existing and new borrowings, their mark to market value has not been recognised in the financial statements and instead net interest is accrued through the profit and loss account.
In addition, there is a further interest rate swap with a notional value of 191.0m, which was taken out by Trillium Prime Property Ltd Partnership to hedge the secured bank loan, which funds the PRIME contract.
This swap mirrors the repayment schedule of the associated bank loan.
As part of the fair value accounting exercise on the acquisition of Trillium, this swap was marked to market at a cost of 14.9m in November 2000.
The cost is being amortised over the life of the interest rate swap as a credit to interest payable.
The interest rate swap was repriced and reprofiled in December 2003 at a cost of 21.1m.
The cost of the repricing and reprofiling is being amortised over the life of the interest rate swap.
