17 Notes to the accounts 7 TAXATION CONTINUED Factors that may affect future tax charges Based on current capital expenditure plans, it is anticipated that capital allowances will be in excess of depreciation in future years.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing properties to their market value or on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would only become payable if the properties were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided for, after offsetting available capital losses, is estimated at 77.8m 2003: 40.7m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
