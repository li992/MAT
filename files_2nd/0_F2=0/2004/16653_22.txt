estimates Accounting policies The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently when dealing with all items which are material in relation to the Groups accounts.
Accounting convention The accounts on pages 44 to 71 are prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and under the historical cost convention.
The Group and Company accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Change in accounting policy The Company adopted, in 2004, the requirements of Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
UITF Abstract 38 gives rise to a prior year adjustment, details of which are given in note 23.
As required by Financial Reporting Standard FRS 3 Reporting Financial Performance, comparative figures for 2003 have been restated.
Basis of consolidation For the purpose of the preparation of the Group accounts, references made to Group subsidiaries relate to subsidiary undertakings of the Group, as defined by the Companies Act 1989.
A joint venture is an undertaking in which the Group has a long-term interest and over which it exercises joint control.
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries and include, on the gross equity method, the Groups share of the net assets, turnover and profits or losses of joint ventures.
The Group accounts include, from the date of acquisition, the results of subsidiaries and joint ventures acquired during the year.
Where appropriate, adjustments are made on consolidation in order that the Group accounts are presented on a consistent basis.
A separate profit and loss account dealing with the results of the Company only has not been presented, as permitted by Section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover Turnover represents the invoice value of goods delivered and services provided to third parties less returns, excluding value added taxes.
Research and development Such expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Foreign currencies Profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas companies are translated at average exchange rates for the year.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Differences arising from the translation, at closing rates, of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures, less the applicable foreign currency borrowings raised to finance such investments, are taken to reserves.
Exchange differences on trading and other items are taken to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation is the amount by which the cost of shares in subsidiaries or joint ventures exceeds the fair value of the Groups share of their net assets at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill arising after 1997 is capitalised and amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life of up to 20 years.
Should the value of this goodwill become recognised as impaired, an impairment charge would be made against operating profit.
Any unamortised goodwill relating to businesses sold or terminated is written-off through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on business divestments.
Goodwill arising before 1998 was written-off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
It remains written-off to reserves even if it is subsequently recognised as having become impaired, in compliance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Such goodwill relating to businesses sold or terminated, whether recognised as having become impaired or not, is written-off through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on business divestments.
Further details of goodwill at the year end and movements in the year are given in note 10.
Tangible fixed assets Details of the Groups accounting policies and bases are given in note 11.
48 Cookson Group plc Annual Report 2004 1 Accounting policies and critical accounting estimates continued Fixed asset investments Shares in Group subsidiaries are stated at cost less any impairment in value in the Company balance sheet.
The Groups joint ventures are incorporated into the Group accounts using the gross equity method of accounting, such that the Groups share of their profit or loss is included in the Group profit and loss account and, in the Group balance sheet, investments in joint ventures are included at the Groups share of the net assets of each joint venture.
The accounting policies of joint ventures are similar in all material aspects to those of the Company and its subsidiaries.
Further details of fixed asset investments at the year end and movements in the year are given in note 12.
Stocks All stocks stated in the Group balance sheet are valued at the lower of cost using the first in first out method and net realisable value.
Cost comprises expenditure directly incurred in purchasing or manufacturing stocks together with, where appropriate, attributable overheads based on normal activity levels.
Provision is made for obsolete and slow moving items.
In addition to the stocks recorded in the balance sheet, the Group holds precious metals under consignment arrangements, further details of which are given in note 13.
Financial instruments The Group primarily uses forward foreign currency contracts and interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates in its borrowings.
These instruments are accounted for as hedges when designated as such at the inception of contracts and, as a result, gains and losses on these foreign exchange contracts are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown in the Group balance sheet at the year end, but the fair value is disclosed in note 17 v. Interest differentials under the contracts are recognised by accruing the net interest payable as it becomes due.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure are immediately taken to the profit and loss account or balance sheet as appropriate.
Translational hedges of foreign currency investments are taken to reserves.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of those instruments.
Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised without discounting in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, with the exception that deferred taxation assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable future profits from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Provision is made for the tax that would arise on remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Critical accounting estimates Cooksons principal accounting policies are set out on pages 48 and 49.
The application of certain of these policies requires assumptions or subjective judgements by management, which are based on past experience and other relevant information.
Estimates made by applying these assumptions and judgements are sometimes based on the outcome of future events and can affect both reported annual profit and Group assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date.
Actual results may differ from the estimates.
The following are the critical policies where assumptions and judgements made by management could have a significant impact on the Groups consolidated financial statements.
Goodwill It is the Groups policy that, for goodwill arising from the acquisition of businesses after 1997, such goodwill is capitalised and amortised over a period up to 20 years.
Management uses its judgement to determine the extent to which this goodwill has a value that will benefit the performance of the Group over future periods.
To assist in making this judgement, management carries out an assessment, at least annually, of the carrying value of the Groups capitalised goodwill, using discounted cash flow forecasts.
Changes to the assumptions and discount rates used in making these forecasts could significantly alter managements assessment of the carrying value of this goodwill.
Any change in the asset lives applied to capitalised goodwill would have an impact on Group profit.
Tangible fixed assets It is Group policy to depreciate tangible fixed assets, except land, on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives.
This applies an appropriate matching of the revenue earned with the capital costs of production and delivery of goods and services.
A key element of this policy is the estimate of the useful life applied to each category of fixed assets which, in turn, determines the annual depreciation charge.
Variations in asset lives could impact Group profit through an increase or decrease in the depreciation charge.
49 Cookson Group plc Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies and critical accounting estimates continued Current asset provisions In the course of normal trading activities, management uses its judgement to establish the net realisable value of various elements of working capital principally stocks and trade debtors.
Provisions are established for obsolete or slow moving stocks, bad or doubtful debts and product warranties.
Provision requirements are based on the facts available to management and are also determined by using profiles, based on past practice, applied to certain aged inventory and debtor categories.
In estimating the collectability of trade debtors, judgement is required in assessing their likely realisation, including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related ageing of the past due balances.
Specific accounts are assessed in situations where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to a deterioration of its financial condition, credit ratings or bankruptcy.
Environmental provisions In certain parts of the business, mainly in the USA, the Group has obligations to carry out environmental clean-ups at former and current production sites.
Many of these obligations will not arise for a number of years and the costs are difficult to predict accurately.
Management uses its judgement and experience to provide an appropriate amount for the likely cost of such clean-ups.
Pensions and other post-employment benefits The Groups results include costs relating to the obligations associated with the provision of pension and other post-employment benefits to current and former employees.
It is managements responsibility to set the assumptions used in determining the key elements of the costs of meeting such future obligations.
These assumptions are set after consultation with the Groups actuaries and include those used to determine regular service costs and the financing elements related to the plans assets and liabilities.
Whilst management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect Group profit.
Deferred taxation The Group has recognised deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised losses and other timing differences arising in certain of the Groups businesses, primarily in the USA.
Account has been taken of future forecasts of taxable profit in arriving at the values at which these assets are recognised.
If these forecast profits do not materialise or change, or there are changes in tax rates or to the period over which the losses or timing difference might be recognised, then the value of the deferred tax asset will need to be revised downwards or upwards in a future period.
The Group has losses and other timing differences for which no value has been recognised for deferred tax purposes in these financial statements.
These can arise in loss-making subsidiaries where the future economic benefit of these timing differences is uncertain.
It can also arise where the timing differences are of such a nature that their value is dependent only on certain types of profit being earned, such as capital profits.
If trading or other appropriate profits are earned in future in these companies, the timing differences may yield benefit to the Group in the form of reduced tax charge.
See note 20 for further details of the deferred tax assets which have been recognised and not recognised in these financial statements.
2 Segmental analyses In each of the following analyses, the costs and net assets of the Groups corporate activities have been allocated primarily according to the relative turnover contribution of each continuing operating segment to the total.
Inter-segment sales are not material in relation to total Group turnover, whether analysed by division or by geographic location of operations.
Of the results of continuing operations, the contribution from acquisitions to turnover and operating profit in 2004 and 2003 was not material.
Certain small divestments were made in 2004 which were not sufficiently material to warrant disclosure as a separate discontinued operation.
Further details of these divestments, and their results for the year ended 31 December 2004, are shown in note 24.
The results reported for 2003 as discontinued operations mainly comprise the Electronics divisions Speedline businesses.
Speedline was largely based in the USA, with satellite operations in Europe and Asia.
Other disposals in 2003 included the Precision Products sector of the Precious Metals division which was sold in January 2003 and largely based in the USA, three non-core European businesses in the Ceramics and Precious Metals divisions and a non-core Asia-Pacific joint venture in the Electronics division.
These discontinued operations previously formed part of the Groups continuing operations.
The total amount for net assets included below is arrived at after adding back to Group assets less Group liabilities of 571.1m 2003: 626.9m borrowings of 354.3m 2003: 415.3m and deducting cash and investments, other than those in joint ventures, of 57.7m 2003: 87.1m after restatement see note 1.

52 Cookson Group plc Annual Report 2004 4 Operating exceptional items The charges of 22.7m in 2004 and 22.2m in 2003 were the result of the implementation of initiatives aimed at ensuring that the cost base of each of the Groups major businesses is aligned with prevailing and near-term market conditions.
The initiatives implemented included redundancy programmes, the consolidation of facilities, plant closures, the streamlining of manufacturing processes and the rationalisation of product lines.
Of the exceptional charges, 7.9m represents asset write-downs 2003: 7.3m the majority of which, together with the plant closures, were in the USA and Continental Europe.
Note 2 sets out the charge by division sector and geographic region.
Total cash spend in 2004 in respect of operating exceptional items was 14.2m 2003: 14.0m, leaving aggregate provisions made but unspent in respect of the above operating exceptional items of 15.1m as at 31 December 2004.

In 2003 the Group decided to utilise US tax losses arising in prior years by way of reduction or repayment of tax liabilities arising in the previous five years.
These actions gave rise to a cash refund of 3.3m in 2003 and a significant adjustment to prior year tax provisions.
No similar utilisation of losses occurred in 2004.
The Group operates in a number of countries, each of which has differing tax rates, laws and practice.
Changes in any of these areas could, adversely or positively, impact the Groups tax charge in future.
Continuing losses, or insufficiency of taxable profit to absorb all expenses, in any subsidiary could have the effect of increasing tax charges in the future, relative to 2004, as no effective tax relief would be available for those losses or expenses.
Other significant factors affecting the current and future tax charge are described in note 1.
8 Dividends No dividends were paid in 2004 or 2003 or are proposed for 2004.
In January 2005, the Board stated that it intended to return to sustained dividend payment as soon as possible and that dividends would be funded through free cash flow and would be linked to the Groups underlying earnings.

The Company believes that the calculation of earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of intangibles, together with the associated tax charge of 1.2m 2003: 5.0m, gives the most appropriate measure of the underlying earnings of the Group for the year.
The shares in Cookson Group plc held by the ESOP note 23 have been excluded from the weighted average number of shares, as the Trustee of the ESOP has waived its rights to receive dividends on the shares held.
Diluted earnings per share are calculated assuming conversion of outstanding dilutive share options.
There were no dilutive share options in 2004 2003: nil.

Of the goodwill arising after 1997, 185.1m related to Ceramics, 235.9m to Electronics and 25.6m to Precious Metals.
Of the 235.9m related to Electronics, 47.1m related to Assembly Materials, 165.8m to Chemistry and 23.0m to Laminates.
Of the pre-1998 goodwill, 152.3m related to Ceramics, 125.2m to Electronics, and 38.0m to Precious Metals.
Of the 125.2m related to Electronics, 87.5m related to Assembly Materials and 37.7m to Laminates.
In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, the Group has carried out a review to determine whether there has been an impairment of its tangible fixed assets, goodwill or other intangibles.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets, goodwill and other intangibles of each of the Groups income generating units have been compared to their recoverable amounts, represented by their value in use to the Group.
Value in use was derived from discounted 10-year cash flow projections, using a growth rate of 3% in the years beyond the projection period and pre-tax discount rates ranging from 10-14%.
The projection period is, in the opinion of the Directors, an appropriate period over which to view the future results of its businesses for this purpose.
As a result of the review, no impairment charges relating to tangible fixed assets, goodwill or other intangibles were required to be recognised in 2004.
The taxation credit associated with goodwill amortisation was 0.1m 2003: 0.3m.
Other intangible assets arose during 2003 on the purchase of a perpetual licensing agreement in the USA.
This is being amortised over its 10-year estimated useful life.

Depreciation on other tangible fixed assets is charged against profit so as to write-off the original cost of the assets, less estimated residual values, in equal instalments over their remaining operating lives.
Operating lives of assets used by Group companies are: for freehold properties between 10 and 50 years: for leasehold properties the term of the lease: and for plant and machinery between one and 15 years.
Included in plant and machinery are the following operating lives: for motor vehicles between one and five years: for information technology equipment between one and five years: and for other plant and machinery, between five and 15 years.

Other fixed asset investments include an investment made by the Group in 1998 in a 20-year revenue-sharing arrangement with Electric Lightwave, Inc. related to a fibre optic cable network between Portland and Los Angeles in the USA.
During 2004, it became clear that the minimum guaranteed revenues enshrined in the arrangement were not likely to be fully recoverable in future.
As a result, the Groups investment was reassessed using a discounted cash flow model with a pre-tax discount factor of 12%.
An impairment write-down of 17.9m was booked to bring the carrying value down to 3.1m.

The Group also held precious metals on behalf of customers for processing, the total value of which at 31 December 2004 was 39.3m 2003: 34.4m.
At 31 December 2004 metal held under consignment comprised 648,586 ounces of gold, 7,554,244 ounces of silver, 20,549 ounces of platinum and 18,427 ounces of palladium.
The Groups precious metal fabrication operations utilise significant amounts of precious metals, being primarily gold by value.
These metals are predominantly held on consignment under arrangements the terms of which provide, inter alia, that the consignor retains title to the metal and has a right of return over the metal without penalty.
Consignors are party to either committed or uncommitted arrangements.
Under uncommitted arrangements, the consignor is under no obligation to supply the precious metal to the Groups fabrication operations and has the right, with limited or in some cases no notice, to demand physical return of the consigned metal.
The metal which the Group fabricates for its customers may be purchased by the Group from the consignor and sold concurrently to the customer, thereby eliminating the Groups exposure to the risk of market fluctuations in metal prices.
Alternatively, the metal may be consigned or sold directly from the consignor to the Groups customers, the Group charging customers only for the fabrication process, which also eliminates the Groups exposure to the risk of market fluctuations in metal prices.
As the consignors retain title and associated risks and benefits of ownership under these arrangements, the physical metal so held is not recorded in the Group balance sheet.
Consignment fees are charged by the consignor and totalled 5.7m in 2004 2003: 5.7m.

Under the terms of this programme, an interest in a pool of trade debtors is sold to a bank in exchange for cash, on which interest is payable to the bank.
A security interest has been granted to the bank over this pool which, at 31 December 2004, comprised 13.9m 2003: 15.9m of trade debtors of which the cash received to date is 10.7m 2003: 11.2m.
The Group is not obliged and does not intend to support any losses arising from the assigned debts against which cash has been advanced.
The providers of the finance have confirmed in writing that, in the event of default in payment by a debtor, they will seek repayment of cash advanced only from the remainder of the pool of debts in which they hold an interest and that repayment will not be required from the Group in any other way.
15 Convertible bonds In 1994, the Company issued 80.0m 7% convertible bonds.
Interest on the bonds was payable semi-annually on 2 November and 2 May.
Redemption of the bonds took place at par on 2 November 2004.
The Groups near term borrowing requirements have been met by a committed syndicated bank facility of 148.0m 2003: 188.0m.
The facility consists of two tranches: a 108.0m revolving credit facility with a maturity of December 2006: and a term facility of 40.0m 2003: 80.0m with a maturity of March 2006 which was utilised to repay the Groups convertible bonds which matured in November 2004.
The facility was secured by fixed and floating charges over certain assets of some of the Groups subsidiaries.
Drawings under this facility as at 31 December 2004 were 40.0m 2003: nil.
Other Group facilities include 296.7m US$570m of senior loan notes.
The senior loan notes, which are held by US investors, are due for repayment between May 2005 and May 2012.
Total capitalised costs, including those in respect of the syndicated bank facility and the senior loan notes, which have been treated as a reduction in borrowings in the accounts, were 2.1m as at 31 December 2004 2003: 3.1m.
Of the 2.1m of capitalised costs, 0.8m related to the senior loan notes and 1.3m related to the syndicated bank facility.
On 1 March 2005 the Group signed a new 200.0m multicurrency revolving credit facility to replace the 148.0m facility which was due to mature in 2006.
The new facility is for a term of three years, with options to extend for a further two years.
The facility is unsecured, with all security and guarantees under the previous facility being fully released.
Borrowings under the facility will be for general corporate purposes.

Prior year adjustment The Company has made a prior period adjustment during 2004 following the release of Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
This Abstract superseded UITF 13, which required that own shares in the Company held through its Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP be disclosed as a fixed asset investment on the face of the Companys balance sheet.
Due consideration needed to be made at each reporting period to the existence of impairment in the carrying value of the investment.
UITF Abstract 38 now requires that such shares be held as a deduction from equity, at the gross cost paid by the Company for the shares.
The adoption of UITF Abstract 38 has given rise to a cumulative prior period adjustment to the opening profit and loss account of 2.9m debit at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.
This represents the carrying value of the ESOP shares at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004.
Between 1998 and 2002 9.5m of provisions had been charged through the profit and loss account to recognise impairment in the carrying value of the ESOP shares.
The gross cost of the ESOP shares at all times between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2004 was 12.4m.

In addition, the Company has, on behalf of the Group, given guarantees to its precious metals consignors amounting to 185.7m 2003: 196.9m, representing all of the value of precious metals held on consignment terms at 31 December 2004.
Further details of these consignment arrangements are given in note 13.
Cookson has extensive international operations and several companies within the Group are parties to legal proceedings, certain of which proceedings are insured claims arising in the ordinary course of the operations of the Group company involved.
While the outcome of litigation can never be predicted with certainty, having regard to legal advice received and the Groups insurance arrangements, management believes that none of these matters will, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Groups financial condition or results of operations.
Legal claims have been brought against Group companies by third parties alleging that persons have been harmed by exposure to hazardous materials.
Two of the Groups subsidiaries are subject to suits in the USA relating to a small number of products containing asbestos manufactured prior to the acquisition of those subsidiaries by the Group.
To date, there have been no liability verdicts against any of these subsidiaries.
A number of suits have been withdrawn, dismissed or settled, and the amount paid, including costs, in relation to this litigation has not been material to the Groups financial position or results of operations.

The Group has both defined benefit and defined contribution plans.
Defined benefit pension plans The Groups principal defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and USA.
The assets of these plans are held in trustee-administered funds and pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the service lives of the active plan members.
Plan assets are not included in the Groups reported assets.
They can increase in value due to capital growth, dividend income and funding contributions made by the Group and plan members.
The chief causes of reduction in plan assets are capital depreciation and pension disbursements to retirees.
The Group regularly engages qualified actuaries to carry out independent valuations of its UK and US defined benefit plans.
The actuarial assumptions and methods used in these valuations are compatible and are used by the actuaries to compute the regular annual cost to the Group of providing the pension benefits under each plan.
There are other defined benefit pension plans in other territories but these are not material in relation to the Group as a whole.
UK defined benefit pension plans The UK has one main defined benefit pension plan the UK Plan and two smaller plans.
Actuarial valuations of the UK Plan are carried out every three years.
The last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2003.
At that date, the market value of plan assets was 179.6m and this represented 81% of accrued plan benefits at the time using the projected unit method of valuation.
In 2004, the actuarial deficit has been charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the average remaining service life of the active plan members.
Given the fall in the equity markets since 2000 and certain changes in actuarial assumptions, it was considered likely that the UK Plan would have an actuarial deficit at this date.
This was also heralded by the actuarial updates carried out to support the Groups disclosures for FRS 17 Retirement Benefits see below.
Whilst accepting that the valuation assumptions for FRS 17 are different than those under SSAP 24, the Directors agreed in early 2003, in consultation with the UK Plans trustees, to make additional funding contributions of 5.0m during that year.
This level of funding was increased by agreement to 6.5m in 2004, with further payments of 10.0m and 10.5m scheduled for 2005 and 2006, respectively.
US defined benefit pension plans Actuarial valuations of the US defined benefit pension plans are carried out every year.
The last full valuation was carried out as at 31 December 2003, at which date the market value of the plan assets was 62.7m.
This represented 65% of accrued plan benefits at that date using the projected unit method of valuation.
In 2004 the actuarial deficit has been charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the average remaining service life of the active pension plan members.
Funding levels for the Groups US defined benefit pension plans are normally based upon annual valuations carried out by independent qualified actuaries and are governed by US government regulations.
Certain of the Groups US defined benefit plans have characteristics similar to defined contribution plans, however with a minimum performance level guaranteed by the Group on the members accounts.
Such plans are dealt with for the purposes of SSAP 24 and FRS 17 disclosure as defined benefit plans.
The cash balance rate assumption in the table below refers to the assumed minimum guaranteed return on members accounts.
Actuarial assumptions used for defined benefit pension plans The principal actuarial assumptions used in arriving at the latest full valuations for the Groups UK and US plans were: UK USA Funding SSAP 24 Funding SSAP 24 basis basis basis basis %%%% Pre-retirement investment returns 6.30 7.80 6.25 Post-retirement investment returns 6.30 6.10 6.25 Increase in pensionable remuneration 4.30 4.00 4.00 Increase in pensions in payment 2.70 2.50 Cash balance rate 5.25 5.30% for past service post-retirement benefits.
67 Cookson Group plc Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 30 Pensions and other post-employment obligations continued Defined contribution pension plans The majority of the Groups pension plans outside the UK and USA are defined contribution plans.
Funding payments in respect of such plans are charged against profit as they fall due.
Pension costs calculated in accordance with SSAP 24 Costs charged through the Groups profit and loss account in respect of pensions are as follows: 2004 2003 m m Regular costs for UK and US defined benefit plans 5.9 7.8 Actuarial variation and interest charge for UK and US defined benefit plans 7.3 1.0 Total costs relating to UK and US defined benefit plans 13.2 8.8 Rest of World defined benefit plans 2.5 2.5 Total costs relating to defined benefit plans 15.7 11.3 Costs of other pension plans 7.5 7.5 Total pension costs 23.2 18.8 Post-employment plans other than pensions The Group has certain legacy post-employment plans other than pensions, largely relating to healthcare benefits in the USA.
The costs of providing these benefits are not funded externally by the Group, instead a provision is held in the Group balance sheet see note 19 to record the current liability, calculated in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice.
The level of the Groups provision is based on independent actuarial valuations, using the projected unit method, and the annual charge to the profit and loss account is calculated so as to spread the costs of providing the benefits over the average remaining service life of the active beneficiaries.
The charge to the profit and loss account for post-employment plans other than pensions in the year was 1.4m 2003: 1.3m.
Disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 during the transitional period prior to its full implementation are shown below.
They are based on the most recent actuarial valuations of the Groups principal defined benefit plans, updated as appropriate by independent qualified actuaries and as required by FRS 17, in order to assess the liabilities of the plans at 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 December 2004.
