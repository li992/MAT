58 SABMiller plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 1.
Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements present the financial record for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003.
The subsidiary and associated undertakings in the group operate in the local currency of the country in which they are based.
From a functional perspective, the group regards these operations as being US dollar-based as the transactions of these entities are, insofar, as is possible, evaluated in US dollars.
In management accounting terms all companies report in US dollars.
The directors of the company regard the US dollar as the functional currency of the group, being the most representative currency of its operations.
Therefore the consolidated financial statements are presented in US dollars.
The exchange rates of rand to US dollar used in preparing the consolidated financial statements were as follows: Weighted Closing average rate rate Year ended 31 March 2003 9.50 7.91 Year ended 31 March 2004 7.06 6.39 The weighted average exchange rates have been calculated based on an average of the exchange rates during the relevant year and weighted according to the turnover of the groups businesses.
Accounting policies Accounting convention The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important group accounting policies is set out below.
Segmental analyses Segmental analyses are in accordance with the basis on which the businesses are managed.
Changes in accounting policies FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, application note G revenue recognition was issued in November 2003.
As a result, certain costs previously included within net operating costs have been reclassified as deductions from turnover.
The restatement reduced each of turnover and net operating costs by US$128 million for the year ended 31 March 2003 in respect of the following segments US$65 million in North America and US$63 million in Europe.
The reclassification related to freight costs and distribution costs.
Had the 2004 financial statements been prepared on the previous basis, the impact would have been to increase each of turnover and net operating costs by US$178 million.
There was no impact on profit for the year in either year.
The Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 was issued in December 2003.
UITF 38 requires shares held by ESOP trusts to be treated as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds, rather than as a fixed asset investment.
Shares held by the employee share trusts have been restated.
Further, following the principles of UITF 38, the SABMiller plc shares held by Safari Ltd, a special purpose vehicle, have been reclassified similarly.
Net assets have thus been reduced by US$629 million as at 31 March 2003.
Net purchases of such shares have been reclassified in the cash flow from purchase of investments within net cash flow for capital expenditure and financial investments to net purchase of own shares for share trusts within net cash flow from financing.
Simultaneously with the issue of UITF 38, UITF 17 Employee share schemes was revised.
The revised UITF 17 requires that the charge to the profit and loss account in relation to share awards be based on the fair value of the shares at the date of grant the market value less any contribution towards the cost of the shares.
The amount recognised is spread over the period to which any performance criteria relate.
The effect of uncertainty as to whether any performance criteria will be met is dealt with by estimating the probability of shares vesting.
Accounting policies continued The cumulative effect of adopting these changes relating to previous years has been recognised in the financial statements as a prior year adjustment and comparative figures for 2003 have been restated accordingly.
The effect of these changes is as follows: Year ended 31 March 2003 US$m Decrease in turnover 128 Decrease in net operating costs 128 Net impact on operating profit Decrease in shareholders funds at the beginning of the period 618 Effect on profit for the financial year Purchase of own shares for share trusts 12 Credit entry re the charge in respect of share option schemes 1 Decrease in shareholders funds at the end of the period 629 Future UK accounting developments The full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits has been delayed.
The disclosures as required by FRS 17 in the current year, which give an indication of the possible impact on the financial statements when fully implemented, are set out in note 34.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial information of the subsidiary and associated undertakings of the relevant businesses owned by SABMiller plc, as outlined in note 1.
The results of subsidiary undertakings sold or acquired are included in the consolidated profit and loss account up to, or from, the date control passed or in the case of associated undertakings, the date significant influence ceased or commenced.
Details of the principal subsidiary and associated undertakings are given on pages 117 to 121.
Where the groups interest in subsidiary undertakings is less than 100%, the share attributable to outside shareholders is reflected in minority interests.
Some of the SABMiller businesses have a local statutory accounting reference date of 31 December, but since 31 March 1999 these have been consolidated in the financial statements on a basis coterminous with the groups accounting reference date.
In addition, the associated undertaking, Distell Group Ltd, has a statutory accounting reference date of 30 June.
In respect of the year ended 31 March 2004, this company has been included based on financial statements drawn up to 31 December 2003, but taking into account any changes in the subsequent period from 1 January 2004 to 31 March 2004 that would materially affect the results.
Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable separable assets and liabilities acquired.
Fair values of these assets and liabilities are determined by reference to market values, where available, or by reference to the current price at which similar assets could be acquired or similar obligations entered into, or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value, using either market rates or the risk-free rates and risk-adjusted expected future cash flows.
Where the fair value of the consideration paid exceeds the fair value of the identifiable separable assets and liabilities acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Where the fair value of the separable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration given, the difference is treated as negative goodwill.
Both purchased and negative goodwill are accounted for as indicated below.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging or crediting the gross amount of any related goodwill to the extent that it has not previously been taken to the consolidated profit and loss account.
60 SABMiller plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Associated undertakings An associated undertaking is an entity, other than a subsidiary undertaking, in which the group has a long-term interest of not less than 20% and in respect of which the group exercises a significant influence over the operational and financial policies.
The results of associated undertakings have been accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an associated undertaking is accounted for as indicated below.
Goodwill The consolidated financial statements adopt the provisions of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets which was effective for financial accounting periods ending on or after 23 December 1998.
Prior to 31 March 1998, purchased and negative goodwill was set off directly against shareholders funds in the acquisition period.
This adjustment will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the businesses to which it relates.
In respect of years subsequent to 31 March 1998, the purchased goodwill that arose has been capitalised.
The Companies Act, 1985, requires that capitalised goodwill be subject, normally, to systematic amortisation.
In the case of goodwill which is regarded as having a limited useful economic life, the groups accounting policy is to amortise the goodwill through the consolidated profit and loss account over the directors estimate of the useful life, being 20 years for the goodwill that has arisen to date.
The directors assessment of the useful life of this goodwill is based on the nature of the business acquired, the durability of the products to which the goodwill attaches and the expected future impact of competition on the business.
Where goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite useful life, it is not amortised.
The useful economic life is regarded as indefinite life where goodwill is capable of continued measurement and the durability of the acquired business can be demonstrated.
Where goodwill is not amortised the directors perform an annual impairment review and any impairment would be charged to the profit and loss account.
As described in note 12 the directors consider the purchased goodwill in ABI to have an indefinite life.
In this regard, in order to give a true and fair view, the financial statements depart from the requirement to amortise goodwill over a finite period, as required by the Companies Act.
Instead annual impairment reviews are undertaken and any impairment that is identified would be charged to the profit and loss account.
It is not possible to quantify the impact of this departure from the Companies Act, because no finite life for goodwill can be identified.
Goodwill previously written off against shareholders funds is not subjected to an annual impairment review and any impairment arising would therefore only be recognised upon disposal of the undertaking which originally gave rise to such goodwill.
Trademarks The fair value of businesses acquired includes trademarks which are recognised in the balance sheet where the trademark has a value which is long term.
Acquired trademarks are only recognised where title is clear, the trademark could be sold separately from the rest of the business and the earnings attributable to it are separately identifiable.
Where the acquired trademark is seen as having a finite useful economic life, it is subject to amortisation, which in respect of trademarks currently held is ten years, being the period for which the group has exclusive rights to those trademarks.
Turnover Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties.
It includes excise duties and taxes levied on casino winnings but excludes value added tax.
Turnover is stated net of price discounts, promotional discounts and similar items.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition, and net realisable value, as follows: Raw materials, consumables and goods for resale: Purchase cost on a first-in first-out basis FIFO.
Finished goods and work in progress: Raw material cost plus direct costs and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Accounting policies continued Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Land and buildings, which have been adapted to specialised functions, are recorded at historical cost.
All other land and buildings, which are used for general purposes, were previously revalued every three years on the basis of open market value for existing use by recognised professional valuers.
On adoption of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets in a prior year, the group resolved to retain the book value of land and buildings which were revalued at 1 April 1998, but not to adopt a policy of revaluation in the future.
These values are retained subject to the requirement to test assets for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
All buildings are depreciated as indicated below.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
In respect of all other tangible fixed assets depreciation is provided on a straightline basis at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less the estimated residual value of each asset, evenly over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold buildings 20 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant, vehicles and systems 2 30 years Containers, including returnable bottles 1 10 years The group regularly reviews its depreciation rates to take account of any changes in circumstances.
When setting useful economic lives, the principal factors the group takes into account are the expected rate of technological developments, expected market requirements for the equipment and the intensity at which the assets are expected to be used.
Profit or loss on the sale of an asset is the difference between the disposal proceeds and the net book value, including any revaluation, of the asset.
Any amount in the revaluation reserve relating to such an asset is transferred directly to shareholders funds and is not included in the profit for the financial year.
Impairment In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill fixed assets are subject to an impairment review if circumstances or events change to indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable.
The review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the fixed asset to its recoverable amount, being the higher of the net realisable value and value in use.
The net realisable value is considered to be the amount that could be obtained on disposal of the asset.
The value in use of the asset is determined by discounting, at a market based pre-tax discount rate, the expected future cash flows resulting from its continued use, including those arising from its final disposal.
When the carrying values of fixed assets are written down by any impairment amount, the loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it incurred.
Should circumstances or events change and give rise to a reversal of a previous impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs and the carrying value of the asset is increased.
The increase in the carrying value of the asset will only be up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, income producing units are considered to be groups of assets and liabilities that generate income, and are largely independent of other income streams.
They also include those assets and liabilities directly involved in producing the income and a suitable proportion of those used to produce more than one income stream.
Investments Fixed asset investments, other than subsidiary and associated undertakings, are stated individually at the lower of cost and their recoverable amount which is determined as the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Current asset investments are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In determining net realisable values, market values are used in the case of listed investments and directors estimates used in the case of unlisted investments.
62 SABMiller plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Capitalisation of interest and other costs Financing costs and certain direct costs incurred, before tax, on major capital projects during the period of development or construction are capitalised up to the time of completion of the project.
Deposits by customers Bottles and containers in circulation are recorded within fixed assets and a corresponding liability is recorded in respect of the obligation to repay the customers deposits.
Deposits paid by customers for branded returnable bottles and containers are reflected in the balance sheet under creditors due within one year.
Any estimated liability that is anticipated may arise in respect of deposits for unbranded containers and bottles is shown in provisions for liabilities and charges.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to recover carried forward tax losses and from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future periods has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies The financial statements denominated in US dollars have been prepared on the basis that transactions in foreign currencies are recorded in US dollars at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate where the transaction is covered by a forward foreign exchange contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
All differences are taken to the consolidated profit and loss account with the exception of differences on long-term foreign currency instruments, to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against foreign equity investments, in which case they are taken directly to shareholders funds together with any exchange difference on the carrying amount of the related asset.
The profit and loss accounts and cash flow statements of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated at weighted average rates of exchange for the relevant reporting period, other than material exceptional items which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction and assets including goodwill and liabilities are translated at exchange rates prevailing at the relevant balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of opening net assets together with differences between profit and loss accounts translated at average and closing rates, are shown as a movement in shareholders funds and in the consolidated statements of total recognised gains and losses.
Leasing commitments Assets held under finance leases which result in group companies receiving substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital element of future obligations under the leases is included as a liability in the balance sheet classified, as appropriate, as a creditor due within or after one year.
The interest element of the rental obligations is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account over the period of the lease term to reflect a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the obligation for each financial year.
Rentals paid on operating leases are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Accounting policies continued Pensions A number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension schemes are operated by the group in accordance with local regulations.
The assets of each scheme are held separately from those of the group and are administered by trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives.
The regular cost is attributed to individual years using the projected unit credit method.
Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees in proportion to their expected payroll costs.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged to the consolidated profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are expensed as incurred.
Post-retirement medical benefits Certain group companies provide post-retirement medical benefits to qualifying employees.
The expected costs of these benefits are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries and contributions are made to the relevant funds over the expected service lives of the employees entitled to those funds.
The estimated cost of providing such benefits is charged to the consolidated profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the employees working lives within the group.
Capital instruments Capital instruments, other than equity shares, are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefits and otherwise are included in shareholders funds.
The finance costs recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares are allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Provisions A provision is recognised when there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Financial instruments Financial assets are recognised when the group has rights or other access to economic benefits.
Such assets consist of cash, equity instruments, a contractual right to receive cash or another financial asset, or a contractual right to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially favourable terms.
Financial liabilities are recognised when there is an obligation to transfer benefits and that obligation is a contractual liability to deliver cash or another financial asset or to exchange financial instruments with another entity on potentially unfavourable terms.
When these criteria no longer apply, a financial asset or liability is no longer recognised.
If a legally enforceable right exists to set off recognised amounts of financial assets and liabilities, which are in determinable monetary amounts, and the group intends to settle on a net basis, the relevant financial assets and liabilities are offset.
Interest costs are charged against income in the year in which they are incurred.
Premiums or discounts arising from the difference between the net proceeds of financial instruments purchased or issued and the amounts receivable or repayable at maturity are taken to net interest payable over the life of the instrument.
Where the fair value of an asset falls below its carrying value, any difference is, in the case of fixed assets, provided for if it is regarded that impairment exists.
In the case of current assets, provision is only made to the extent that it is considered as resulting in a lower net realisable value.
64 SABMiller plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments The derivative instruments used by the group, which are used solely for hedging purposes i. e. to offset foreign exchange and interest rate risks, comprise interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts.
Such derivative instruments are used to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the group in line with the groups risk management policies.
Interest rate differentials under swap arrangements and forward rate agreements used to manage interest rate exposures are recognised by adjustment to net interest payable.
Premiums or discounts arising on the purchase of derivative instruments are amortised over the shorter of the life of the instrument and the underlying exposure.
Currency swap agreements and forward foreign exchange contracts are valued at closing rates of exchange.
Resulting gains and losses are offset against foreign exchange gains or losses on the related borrowings or, where the instrument is used to hedge a committed future transaction, are deferred until the transaction occurs and shown within debtors or creditors as appropriate.
Where the instrument ceases to meet the criteria of being a hedge transaction or the underlying exposure which it is hedging is sold, matures or is extinguished, then the instrument is valued at the appropriate market rate, after having taken account of selling costs.
Any resultant gains and losses are reflected in operating income in the consolidated profit and loss account.
A similar treatment is applied where the hedge is of a future transaction and that transaction is no longer likely to occur.
There is no material difference between the source and destination of turnover.
Turnover between segments is immaterial.
Includes US$6 million of integration costs incurred in other segments.

These costs relate mainly to severance costs in 2004 and in 2003, and in 2003 also included consultancy fees, office closure costs and expenses related to the reorganisation of the Miller and Pilsner Urquell international businesses, including severance costs and international brand realignment costs.
Following the acquisition of Miller Brewing Company, an operating review resulted in management announcing, on 10 January 2003, the closure of the Tumwater brewery effective from 1 July 2003.
Total brewery closure costs in 2003 amounted to US$35 million and included the impairment of tangible fixed assets to net recoverable value US$20 million and rationalisation costs, including redundancy and associated closure costs US$15 million.
In 2004, US$4 million of the closure costs provided in the prior year were deemed surplus and were credited to the profit and loss account in the year.
Following the decision in the year to cease the production and distribution of Flavoured Malt Beverages FMBs, with the exception of the SKYY brands, at Miller an impairment charge of US$5 million has been taken against assets used in FMB production.
Following the groups acquisition of brewing and soft drink bottling interests in Central America towards the end of 2001, costs have been incurred to restructure the Central American operations of US$6 million 2003: US$12 million.
These expenses consist primarily of retrenchment costs in 2004 of US$6 million 2003: US$6 million, and also in 2003 consultancy fees of US$3 million and other associated costs of US$3 million.
The closure of the water bottling plant in the Canary Islands, Europe, has taken place during the year.
Total plant closure costs in the year amounted to US$6 million and included the impairment of tangible fixed assets to net recoverable value US$4 million and rationalisation costs including redundancy and associated closure costs US$2 million.

SABMillers share of the profit on disposal was US$6 million.
Castel recognised a profit on disposal of the Youki brand in Angola.
SABMillers share of the profit was US$1 million.
In the period, Appletiser SA recorded a pre-tax profit on the disposal of its Valpr and Just Juice trademarks of US$13 million, which were sold to a subsidiary of The Coca-Cola Company TCCC.
Appletiser continues to produce the Valpr and Just Juice brands under a manufacturing agreement with TCCC.
The group is still in dispute resolution with Shoprite Holdings Ltd regarding the disposal of the OK Bazaars some years ago.
As a result of a surplus arising from the liquidation of the OK Bazaars pension fund, which was returned to the Shoprite group, Shoprite has paid The South African Breweries Ltd, OK Bazaars former parent company, an after-tax equivalent amount of US$47 million, pursuant to the sale agreement.
On 31 March 2003 as part of an empowerment deal announced on 12 December 2002, the group disposed of its holdings in the Southern Sun Hotels and Gaming group, in return for cash, a 49% interest in the ordinary share capital of Tsogo Sun Holdings Pty Ltd new Tsogo Sun, together with US$42 million of preference shares in new Tsogo Sun.
Effectively, the transaction reduced the groups holdings in the Hotels division from 100% to 49%, and in the Gaming division from 50% to 49%.
The groups investment in new Tsogo Sun is being equity accounted.
The partial disposal of the Hotel and Gaming interests resulted in a gain of US$12 million, which consisted of profit on the transaction, after taking into account costs of disposal.
In addition, goodwill of US$8 million which had been written off against reserves was taken into account.

At 31 March 2004 there were 12,879,064 share purchase options outstanding under the SABMiller plc Executive Share Purchase Scheme South Africa, 7,738,766 share purchase options outstanding under the SABMiller plc Executive Share Option Scheme Approved Scheme and No 2 Scheme combined, 1,738,147 conditional awards under the SABMiller plc Performance Share Awards Scheme and 1,825,976 share purchase options outstanding under the SABMiller plc International Employee Share Scheme which have not yet vested.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on a weighted average number of shares in issue of 1,264,700,452, after adjusting for 72,507,805 weighted potentially dilutive ordinary shares arising from the share options and the guaranteed convertible bond, and the profit for the financial year as shown below, adjusted for a net interest saving of US$26 million, on the 4.25% guaranteed convertible bond.
The average share price of SABMiller plc since the beginning of the financial year, used in determining the number of potentially dilutive shares, is US$8.43, compared with an average strike price on the outstanding options of US$8.05.
The guaranteed convertible bond was not dilutive in respect of basic earnings per share for the year ended 31 March 2003.
The group has also presented an adjusted earnings per share figure to exclude the impact of amortisation and other nonrecurring items in order to present a more meaningful comparison for the years shown in the consolidated financial statements.
Adjusted earnings per share has been based on adjusted headline earnings for each financial year and on the same number of weighted average shares in issue as the basic earnings per share calculation.
Headline earnings per share has been calculated in accordance with the Institute of Investment Management and Research IIMR s Statement of Investment Practice No.

The acquisition of Birra Peroni SpA resulted in US$283 million goodwill and other acquisitions within Africa and Asia and Europe added a further US$33 million.
Goodwill arising from the acquisitions is being amortised over 20 years, with the exception of purchased goodwill in ABI, which the directors believe has an indefinite life.
This is consistent with the treatment of goodwill that arose on the acquisition of Suncrush, which was acquired by ABI on 8 June 1998.
The directors consider the goodwill to be supported by the existence of bottlers agreements with Coca-Cola Southern Africa Pty Ltd CCSA.
ABI has similar bottlers agreements in respect of other regions within South Africa.
These bottlers agreements, which are based on the Coca-Cola system, establish performance obligations as to production, distribution and marketing arrangements to maximise long-term growth in volume, cash flow and shareholder value of the bottler company.
The Coca-Cola system came into being during 1899 and has had a consistent history of growth and success since that date.
Intangible assets continued The Suncrush agreements with CCSA were established in 1955 and have been in place since then.
The current agreements are for a period of ten years, with an extension of five years, expiring on 30 September 2007 and contain provisions for renewal at no cost.
ABI has had similar agreements since 1976 and they have always been renewed prior to expiry.
In the view of the directors, the bottlers agreements reflect a long and ongoing relationship between the respective managements of ABI and CCSA.
The directors have given due consideration to financial forecasts in respect of the ABI business, the history of dealings of ABI with CCSA and the established international practice of The Coca-Cola Company in relation to its bottlers agreements.
In light of the above factors, the directors believe that the Suncrush agreements will continue to be renewed at the end of their legal expiry dates and the commercial value of the Coca-Cola product will be maintained.
Accordingly, the directors are of the view that the goodwill of US$294 million 2003: US$238 million, as underpinned by the bottlers agreements, currently has an indefinite economic life.
The directors have performed a review for impairment at 31 March 2004 and are of the opinion that no provision is required.
The amount of cumulative goodwill in respect of purchased subsidiary and associated undertakings which has been set off against shareholders funds prior to 31 March 1998 was US$187 million at 31 March 2004 2003: US$167 million after resurrecting goodwill amounting to US$8 million on the partial disposal of the groups interests in the Hotels and Gaming division.

During the year ended 31 March 2004, US$2 million of this provision was further utilised in regard to costs associated with SAB Ltds previously disposed of remaining retail interests.
The residual US$22 million relates mainly to the disposal of OK Bazaars 1929 Ltd to Shoprite Holdings Ltd Shoprite.
As disclosed in previous annual reports, a number of claims were made by Shoprite in relation to the valuation of the net assets of OK Bazaars at the time of the sale and for alleged breaches by SAB Ltd of warranties contained in the sale agreements.
These claims are being contested by SAB Ltd and have been submitted for dispute resolution to independent accountants acting as experts and not as arbitrators.
In March 2000 an opinion was received from the experts but subsequent to that year end Shoprite instituted action against the independent experts and SABMiller indicating an intention to refute the expert opinion.
While full provision for all claims has already been made on the basis of prudence, the actual outcome of the dispute cannot be estimated by the directors at this time.
The further information ordinarily required by FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent asset has not been disclosed on the grounds that it can be expected to seriously prejudice the outcome of the dispute.
Provisions for liabilities and charges continued Post-retirement benefits The provision for post-retirement benefits represents the provision for medical benefits for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa, for post-retirement medical and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their dependants in North America, and pension provisions for employees in North and Central America, South Africa, Europe and Africa and Asia.
The principal assumptions on which these provisions are based are disclosed in note 34.
Insurance Insurance provisions of US$30 million 2003: US$35 million represent amounts provided in respect of claims made by employees for health insurance and work-related accidents.
Management estimates that the provision will be substantially utilised in the next one to two years.
Other provisions At 31 March 2004 the group retained US$110 million 2003: US$60 million of other provisions.
The principal individual components of this amount are as follows: The group has recognised various provisions, totalling US$35 million at 31 March 2004 2003: US$11 million, in relation to taxation exposures it believes may arise.
The provisions principally relate to corporate taxation in respect of a number of group companies and are not individually significant.

Based on the unaudited US GAAP management accounts, Miller Brewing Company and its subsidiaries earned a profit after taxation and minorities of US$142 million for the period from 1 January 2002 to 8 July 2002.
The summary profit and loss account for this period is shown below: Period ended 8 July 2002 US$m Turnover 2,659 Operating profit 245 Interest 11 Profit before taxation 234 Taxation 89 Profit after taxation 145 Equity minority interests 3 Profit for the period 142 There were no recognised gains and losses in the period ended 8 July 2002 other than the profit after taxation and minorities of US$142 million shown above.
For the year ended 31 December 2001, Miller earned US GAAP profit after taxation and minority interests of US$231 million.
The reported profit after taxation figures and the amounts shown in the summary profit and loss for the periods indicated above do not reflect the impact of changes to the accounting policies or other fair value adjustments made by the group subsequent to their acquisition.
From 9 July 2002, the date of acquisition, to 31 March 2003, the Miller operations contributed US$341 million to the groups EBITDA, paid US$47 million in respect of taxation, US$45 million in respect of servicing finance, and utilised US$94 million for capital expenditure.

For the year ended 31 March 2003: Hotels and Gaming On 31 March 2003, SABMiller entered into an agreement with Tsogo Investment Holding Company Pty Ltd whereby SABMiller contributed its entire hotel and gaming interests, including 100% of Southern Suns hotel interests and 50% of Tsogo Suns gaming interests, to the new company, Tsogo Sun Holdings Pty Ltd new Tsogo Sun, in exchange for ordinary shares representing 49% of new Tsogo Sun, US$42 million of new Tsogo Sun redeemable preference shares and US$43 million cash, net of expenses.
Effectively, the transaction has reduced the groups holding in the Hotels division from 100% to 49%, and in the Gaming division from 50% to 49%.
The transaction generated an after tax accounting profit of US$4 million calculated as follows: US$m Tangible fixed assets 75 Other fixed asset investments 95 Stock 1 Debtors 16 Cash and cash equivalents 42 Creditors amounts falling due within one year 49 Creditors amounts falling due after one year 7 Provision for liabilities and charges 2 171 Equity minority interests 1 Net assets disposed 170 Net proceeds on disposal 182 12 Goodwill written back on disposal 8 Profit on disposal 4 The proceeds were comprised as follows: US$m Net cash 43 Investments in Tsogo Sun Holdings 49% 97 R400 million of Tsogo Sun Holdings redeemable preference shares 42 182 Included US$1 million accrued costs.
Financial instruments The group purchases or issues financial instruments in order to finance its operations and to manage the interest rate and currency risks that arise from those operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial balances, for example, trade debtors, trade creditors, accruals and prepayments, arise directly from the groups operations.
The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained reserves, bank revolving credit borrowings, long-term bank loans and corporate bonds.
In respect of its South African businesses, the group manages overnight cash flows centrally through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sabfin Pty Ltd.
Long-term bank financing is arranged locally by the South African entities.
Project finance and term borrowing are negotiated directly with the banking industry by group operating subsidiaries, but subject to internal group treasury policies.
Outside South Africa, the groups treasury is managed by SABMiller Finance BV which is responsible for cash, the central borrowing portfolio, and foreign exchange management for the non-South African businesses.
The group also enters into derivatives transactions, principally forward foreign currency contracts, forward rate agreements and interest rate swaps in order to manage the currency and interest rate risk arising from the groups operations.
The group does not write interest rate or currency options and currency options are only purchased as a cost-effective alternative to forward foreign exchange contracts.
It is group policy that no trading in financial instruments be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
Compliance with the groups policies and exposure limits is reviewed at quarterly meetings of the board of directors.
These policies have remained unchanged throughout the year ended 31 March 2004.
Interest rate risk The group finances its operations through a mixture of retained reserves, bank and corporate bond borrowings.
The group borrows principally in rand, euro, Polish zloty, Czech krone and in US dollars at both fixed and floating rates of interest.
The interest rate characteristics of new borrowings and the refinancing of existing borrowings are positioned according to expected movements in interest rates.
In order to hedge specific exposures in the interest rate repricing profile of existing borrowings and anticipated peak additional borrowings the group makes use of interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements to generate the desired interest profile and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
The groups policy is to maintain a level of fixed rate borrowings measured on a rolling basis intended to limit the impact of a 1% change in interest rates to 1% of group operating profit excluding exceptional items.
As at 31 March 2004, 68% 2003: 32% of the groups borrowings were at fixed rates after taking into account interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.
The changes in the fixed rate percentage between the two years is analysed further in this note under the interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities and financial assets.
Liquidity risk In order to mitigate any liquidity risk that the group may face, the groups policy has been, throughout the year ended 31 March 2004, to maintain substantial unutilised banking facilities and reserve borrowings capacity, as indicated by the level of undrawn facilities.
Foreign currency risk The group seeks to mitigate the effect of structural currency exposures by borrowing, where cost effective, in the same currencies as the functional currencies of its main operating units.
It is not the groups policy to hedge foreign currency translation exposures.
The group also has transactional currency exposures which principally arise from sales or purchases, in currencies other than the units functional currency.
The groups policy is to limit the aggregate uncovered net transaction exposure to US$60 million 2003: US$60 million being intended to limit the impact on group operating profit to 1% for every 10% movement in exchange rates against the US dollar.
The actual position at 31 March 2004 was US$10 million 2003: US$14 million.

Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities and financial assets After taking into account the groups interest rate and currency swaps and forward rate agreements the currency and interest rate exposures of the borrowings of the group at 31 March 2004 were: Financial Floating liabilities rate Fixed rate where no financial financial interest is liabilities liabilities Total paid Currency US$m US$m US$m US$m SA rand 13 78 91 US dollars 2,148 933 3,081 11 Central European currencies 142 117 259 Euro 22 22 2 Other currencies 67 1 68 At 31 March 2003 2,392 1,129 3,521 13 SA rand 13 38 51 US dollars 660 2,316 2,976 6 Central European currencies 141 146 287 Euro 252 252 1 Other currencies 125 16 141 At 31 March 2004 1,191 2,516 3,707 7 Based on the above floating rate borrowings at 31 March 2004, a 1% change in interest rates would impact group operating profit, over a 12-month period, by approximately US$12 million, which is 0.9% of group operating profit.
The percentage of fixed rate borrowings at 31 March 2004 was 68% 2003: 32%.

Financial instruments continued Floating rate borrowings are mainly bank sourced and bear interest at various money market rates which include overnight call, and up to the 12-month term rates in respect of SA rand activities.
Euro and US dollar floating rate borrowings are fixed in advance for periods ranging from 30 to 180 days and are mainly priced by reference to Euribor LIBOR.
Central European borrowing rates vary significantly between the various functional currency areas comprising this region, but are priced by reference to a combination of local market rates or LIBOR depending on the practice of the various markets.
The group held the following financial assets, as part of the financing arrangements of the group at 31 March 2004: 2004 2003 US$m US$m SA rand short-term deposits 1 US dollar short-term deposits 18 Other short-term deposits 13 1 SA rand cash 236 97 US dollar cash 309 349 Other cash 106 113 682 561 The above financial assets are all priced at floating rates with interest rates reset and or maturity dates within one year.
Rand assets attract interest rates at overnight money market call rate, and US dollar assets attract LIBOR related interest rates at various margins.
Other currencies include those of Central European countries, Central America and the African continent.
Rand cash and short-term deposits are subject to South African exchange control regulations.
South Africas exchange control regulations provide for restrictions on exporting capital from South Africa, other than normal dividends.
Undrawn borrowing facilities The group has the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities available to it: Expiring Expiring between Expiring within one and in more than one year two years two years Total US$m US$m US$m US$m Group Central Treasury 700 700 Africa & Asia 46 46 Europe 254 4 98 356 Americas 69 2 71 South Africa 417 417 At 31 March 2003 786 704 100 1,590 Group Central Treasury 561 561 Africa & Asia 31 8 39 Europe 203 46 68 317 Americas 11 10 21 South Africa 576 576 At 31 March 2004 1,382 64 68 1,514 As at 31 March 2004 facilities expiring within one year include the group central treasury revolving credit facility.
The other facilities expiring within one year are of a general banking nature and thus subject to review at various dates usually on an annual basis, and it is expected that this profile will continue relative to core working capital and seasonal peak borrowing requirements.
The facilities expiring beyond two years are of a project and structured finance nature, and are mostly utilised to finance capital expenditure.
104 SABMiller plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 30.
Financial instruments continued Currency exposures The group seeks to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments by borrowing as far as possible in the same currencies as the operating currencies of its main operating units.
Gains and losses arising on net investments and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The table below shows the extent to which group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
The table below shows the groups transactional or non-structural currency exposures that could give rise to net currency gains and losses which are recognised in the profit and loss account.

Certain subsidiaries have open forward contracts to manage short-term foreign currency exposures to expected future trade imports and exports.
These activities are predominantly centred in South Africa and take place between the SA rand, US dollar and the euro.
Based on the above net transaction exposure position at 31 March 2004, a simultaneous 10% change in all foreign exchange rates against divisional reporting currencies would impact group operating profit by approximately US$1.0 million, which is well within the policy limit of 1% of group operating profit.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table presents the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups financial instruments as at 31 March 2004.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The estimated net fair values have been determined using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies, as detailed below, but are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the group could realise in the normal course of business.
Financial instruments continued 2004 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value US$m US$m US$m US$m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations: Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 613 618 2,409 2,409 Long-term borrowings 3,094 3,506 1,114 1,175 Financial assets 1,717 1,717 1,363 1,363 Other financial liabilities 2,242 2,242 1,634 1,634 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements 18 Forward foreign exchange contracts 15 Commodity contracts 1 Derivative financial instruments held or issued to hedge the currency and interest rate exposure on expected future transactions: Interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements 8 Forward foreign exchange contracts 3 Commodity contracts 1 2 The following methods and assumptions were used by the group in determining fair values: Liquid resources, trade debtors and trade creditors the book values reported in the balance sheet.
Borrowings the fair values of the groups fixed rate loans are estimated using quoted prices or, where such prices are not available, discounted cash flows analysed using the appropriate yield curve.
The book values of floating rate borrowings approximate their fair value.
Forward instruments the fair values of interest rate derivatives are based on discounted cash flow analysis and comprise contracts with fixing dates after 31 March 2004.
The fair values of forward foreign exchange contracts are determined using the relevant market forward foreign exchange rates.
Hedging The groups policy is to hedge on a cost effective basis the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate derivatives: Currency transaction risk using forward foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency creditors.
Forward foreign currency contracts are also used to hedge currency exposures on future expected transactions.
Under the groups accounting policy, foreign currency balances which are hedged using forward foreign currency contracts are translated at the forward rate inherent in the contracts.
Consequently, the relevant asset or liability effectively has the gain or loss on the hedging instrument embedded in its carrying value.
Such gains and losses are treated as deferred until the underlying position matures: and Commodity price risk commodity contracts are purchased from time to time to hedge the underlying price risks inherent in the aluminium component of can purchases.

In addition, Miller has various long-term supply contracts with unrelated third parties to purchase certain materials used in its production and packaging process.
The terms of these contracts generally stipulate that Miller must use the designated suppliers for expected minimum percentages of its annual purchase requirements of the specified materials.
However, Miller is not obliged to make any purchases unless it requires supplies of such materials.

Miller and Pabst Brewing Company Pabst are responsible for the Milwaukee Brewery Workers Pension Plan.
In connection with Pabsts closure of its Milwaukee, Wisconsin brewery and their contract brewing agreement with Miller, Pabst entered into a withdrawal liability settlement agreement, which requires annual payments by Pabst to this pension plan of approximately US$4 million until 2013.
In the event that Pabst is unable to fulfil its pension plan obligation, the plan would have recourse to all the assets of Pabst and its parent company.
If such assets do not satisfy Pabsts remaining pension obligation, Miller would be required to fund the remaining Pabst withdrawal liability until 2013.
SABMiller and Altria entered into a tax matters agreement the Agreement on 30 May 2002, to regulate the conduct of tax matters between them with regard to the acquisition of Miller and to allocate responsibility for contingent tax costs.
SABMiller has agreed to indemnify Altria against any taxes, losses, liabilities and costs that Altria incurs arising out of or in connection with a breach by SABMiller of any representation, agreement or covenant in the Agreement, subject to certain exceptions.
The group has exposures to various environmental risks.
Although it is difficult to predict the groups liability with respect to these 108 SABMiller plc Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 33.
Contingent liabilities continued risks, future payments, if any, would be made over a period of time in amounts that would not be material to the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
The group has a number of activities in a wide variety of geographic areas and is subject to certain legal claims incidental to its operations.
In the opinion of the directors, after taking appropriate legal advice, these claims are not expected to have, either individually or in aggregate, a material adverse effect upon the groups financial position, except insofar as already provided in the consolidated financial statements.
The group has not provided for deferred UK income and foreign withholding taxes relating to unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, as remittance of these earnings is not currently anticipated in the foreseeable future.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
These schemes have been designed and are administered in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The majority of the schemes are funded and the schemes assets are held independently of the groups finances.
Pension and post-retirement benefit costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent professionally qualified actuaries.
Generally, the projected unit method is applied to measure the defined benefit scheme liabilities.
The group also provides medical benefits, which are mainly unfunded, for retired employees and their dependants in South Africa.
The main assumptions used in calculating the costs were an annual discount rate of 11%, consumer inflation of 7% and medical cost inflation of 9%.
The last valuation was performed on 31 March 2003.
Miller provides post-retirement, medical and life insurance benefits, which are unfunded, to eligible employees and their dependants.
Obligations for post-retirement medical benefit plans were US$346 million at 31 March 2003, the date of the most recent valuation.
The principal assumptions used in calculating the liabilities were an annual discount rate of 8%, consumer inflation of 2.75% and medical cost inflation of 10%.
The pension and post-retirement medical benefit costs for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 US$m US$m Defined contribution scheme costs 44 34 Defined benefit scheme costs 51 23 Post-retirement medical benefits costs 42 28 Pension accruals 42 26 Provisions for pensions 134 127 Provisions for post-retirement benefits 404 358 The group operates various defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
Details of the main defined contribution scheme is provided below: The South African Breweries Staff Provident Fund During the financial year ended 31 March 1998, the South African Breweries Pension Fund was liquidated.
Members of this fund were converted from a defined benefit basis to a defined contribution basis and transferred to the South African Breweries Staff Provident Fund.
On transfer to the Provident Fund, members received an enhancement of 27% of their actuarial reserve value.
The market value of assets as at 1 December 1997 was US$288 million.
The liquidation of the pension fund was approved by the Financial Services Board of South Africa and the transfer of assets was substantially completed on 31 July 1998.
At the liquidation date an actuarial valuation of the pension fund indicated an estimated surplus to the employer of approximately US$55 million.
The main assumptions used in the calculation of the defined benefit liabilities and to calculate the variation cost in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pensions costs were a long-term investment return of 15% per annum and a real return in excess of salary inflation of approximately 1% per annum on average.
The level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities, calculated at the liquidation date, was approximately 128%.
The surplus has been transferred to the Staff Provident Fund and is held separately from members assets as an employer reserve.
In terms of the rules of the fund, this employer reserve is currently being used to fund a contribution holiday.
In accordance with SSAP 24, the benefit of this contribution holiday is to be spread over the period of the average future working lives of the employees, estimated to be ten years.
Details of the major defined benefit schemes are provided overleaf: SABMiller plc 109 34.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits continued The ABI Pension Fund The latest valuation of the ABI Pension Fund was carried out at 1 January 2001 by an independent actuary using the attained age method.
The main assumptions were price inflation of 8% per annum, a long-term investment return of 12.5% per annum, rate of salary inflation of 10% per annum and pension inflation of 8% per annum.
The latest actuarial valuation revealed a surplus of US$17 million in the actuarial value of the assets of US$49 million compared to the actuarial value of the liabilities.
This represents a funding level of 153%.
The market value of assets at 1 January 2001 was US$59 million.
Miller Pension Schemes Salaried employees substantially all salaried employees of Miller are covered by a defined benefit pension plan, a survivor income benefit plan and a long-term disability plan.
Previously the salaried employees of Miller Brewing Company participated in the salaried employees pension scheme of Altria.
On 9 July 2002, Miller Brewing Company established its own pension scheme for salaried employees.
Assets from the Altria plan will be transferred to the Miller plan upon approval as a qualified pension plan by the Internal Revenue Service.
As of 9 July 2002, the salaried employee pension plan had a deficit of US$36 million in the actuarial value of the plan assets of US$364 million compared to the actuarial value of the liabilities.
This represents a funding level of 91%.
Hourly employees eligible hourly employees participate in stand-alone pension plans providing flat dollar benefits based on years of service.
The most recent actuarial valuations of these plans, and of Millers post-retirement benefit plans, were carried out by professionally qualified actuaries at 1 January 2003 using the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions used in the preparation of the pension valuations were an annual discount rate of 8%, a rate of increase in flat dollar benefits of 2% and consumer inflation of 2.75%.
The latest actuarial valuation revealed a deficit of US$5 million in the actuarial value of the assets of US$180 million compared to the actuarial value of the liabilities.
This represents a funding level of 97%.
Certain of Millers hourly employees participate in the Milwaukee Brewery Workers Pension Plan.
As part of the withdrawal settlement, Pabst, which had participated in the plan prior to 1997, has agreed to make annual contributions of approximately US$4 million to this plan until 2013.
The plans funded status net of the present value of Pabsts withdrawal payments at 31 March 2004 is set out below: US$m Market value of assets 39 Present value of accrued obligations, net of Pabst withdrawal payments 73 Deficit 34 Additional disclosures required under Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 In November 2000, the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits which changes the way in which companies are required to measure, recognise and disclose their obligations for pension and post-retirement benefits, and the related amounts charged to the profit and loss account and statement of recognised gains and losses.
