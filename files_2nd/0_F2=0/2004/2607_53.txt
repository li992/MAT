A full actuarial valuation of the GUS scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
A full actuarial valuation of the GUS defined benefit scheme was carried out at 31 March 2001 by independent, qualified actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting Limited, using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions used in that valuation for SSAP 24 purposes were as follows: Valuation as at 31 March 2001 Valuation rate of interest Pre-retirement 6.0% per annum Post-retirement 6.0% per annum Rate of future earnings growth 4.3% per annum Pension and inflation increases 2.5% per annum As at 31 March 2001 the market value of the GUS schemes assets was 327m.
On the above assumptions, this represented 100% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members.

Burberry has been contributing 17.9% 2003: 17.9% in respect of members in the main benefit section.
