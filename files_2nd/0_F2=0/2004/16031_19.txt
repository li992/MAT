Pension arrangements During the year, the group operated one final salary scheme: the Travis Perkins Pensions and Dependants Benefit Scheme the Group Scheme, the assets of which were held in a separate trustee administered fund, funded by contributions from the group companies and the employees.
Contributions are paid to the trustees on the basis of advice from an independent professionally qualified actuary who carries out a valuation of each scheme every three years.

2004 2003 Group profit on ordinary activities before tax %m %m Tax on group profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 30.0% 57.1 30.0% 48.8 Effects of: Net expenses not deductible for tax purposes principally goodwill amortisation 3.3% 6.2 3.5% 5.7 Capital allowances in excess of depreciation 1.2 % 2.2 0.7 % 1.1 Depreciation on non-qualifying property 0.8% 1.6 0.7% 1.2 Gains on share options exercised during period 2.3 % 4.6 1.1 % 1.8 Other timing differences principally pension scheme payments 4.2 % 8.0 0.7 % 1.1 Prior period adjustment 0.4% 0.9 0.1 Group current tax charge for year 26.8% 51.0 31.7% 51.6 Deferred tax of 10.2 million 2003: 10.3 million has not been provided on revalued fixed assets and fixed assets subject to rollover relief.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
The groups planned level of capital investment is expected to remain at similar levels.
Therefore, it expects to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years, at a similar level to the current year.
The taxation charge is based on profit before tax for the year at the UK standard rate.
There is no tax charge on profits on disposal of properties due to claims for rollover relief for which no deferred taxation provision has been made, or a tax credit in respect of the amortisation of goodwill.
Earnings per ordinary share a Basic earnings per ordinary share 2004 2003 Basic earnings per ordinary share are calculated from the following ratio: Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 130.1m 108.9m Average number of shares in issue 114,232,096 112,782,720 b Diluted earnings per ordinary share 2004 2003 Diluted earnings per ordinary share are calculated from the following ratio: Profit on ordinary activities after taxation 130.1m 108.9m Average number of shares including outstanding options 115,554,686 114,359,686 The difference in the average number of shares in issue used as the denominator for the calculations of basic and diluted earnings per share is due to the premium element of share options still outstanding at the end of each financial period, based on the average mid-market price for that year.
The adjustment to the number of shares is: 2004 2003 No.
Premium element of share options based on average mid-market share price for the year 1,322,590 1,576,966 c Adjusted earnings per ordinary share Adjusted earnings per ordinary share which are calculated based upon earnings before amortisation of goodwill and are presented in addition to the basic earnings per share calculated in accordance with FRS 3 and FRS 14 since, in the opinion of the directors, this presents a better like-for-like comparison of the earnings of the group between the relevant periods.
Basic earnings per share may be reconciled to adjusted earnings per share before amortisation of goodwill as follows: 2004 2003 Adjusted earnings per ordinary share 129.1p 110.0p Amortisation of goodwill 15.2 p 13.5 p Basic earnings per ordinary share 113.9p 96.5p 66 TRA VIS PERKINS PLC 10.
