24 Pensions The Group operates a number of funded final salary pension schemes including two executive arrangements, all of which have been set up under Trusts that hold their financial assets separately from those of the Group.
In addition, a number of dened contribution arrangements are currently operated, however the cost of these is immaterial and is not separately disclosed within the pension costs for the Group.
Two of the schemes, namely the Mirror Group Pension Scheme the Old Scheme and the MGN Past Service Pension Scheme the Past Service Scheme cover the liabilities in respect of service up to 13 February 1992, the date when the Old Scheme was closed.
The Past Service Scheme was established to meet the liabilities for service up to 13 February 1992 for employees and former employees, who worked regularly on the production and distribution of Mirror Groups newspapers, which are not satisfied by payments from the Old Scheme and the Maxwell Communications Pension Plan or by the State.
An actuarial valuation of these pension schemes as at 31 December 2002, showed that they have insufficient assets to meet their liabilities for members benets, therefore contributions of 3.5 million were paid to the Past Service Scheme in 2004.
In 2005 agreement has been reached with the trustees to pay 9 million and for actuarial valuations to be carried out during the year.
In addition to the above schemes, the Group operates a further eight final salary schemes.
Formal valuations of schemes are carried out regularly, the actuarial methods and assumptions used to calculate each schemes assets and liabilities varying according to the actuarial and funding policies adopted by their respective trustees.
Pg 86 Notes to the financial statements continued 24 Pensions continued The most significant of the schemes are the Trinity Retirement benefit Scheme the Trinity Scheme, the MGN Pension Scheme the MGN Scheme and the Midland Independent Newspapers Pension Scheme the MIN Scheme, which together with the Old Scheme and the Past Service Scheme represent over 98% of the aggregate market value.
The last formal valuation of these schemes was undertaken on 30 June 2003 for the Trinity Scheme, 31 December 2002 for the MGN Scheme and 31 March 2004 for the MIN Scheme.
These valuations showed deficits of 25.1 million, 25.2 million and 30.8 million respectively.
All of the schemes are being funded in accordance with the recommendations of the respective actuaries.
In 2004, employers contributions to the MGN Scheme increased by 1.1% to 11.1%: the employers contribution to the Trinity Scheme increased by 5% to 14%.
The employers contribution to the MIN Scheme remained at 14% in 2004 but will increase by 1% to 15% in 2005.
During 2002, the decision was taken to close entry to the three final salary pension schemes to new employees with effect from 1 January 2003.
All new employees are entitled to participate in a dened contribution plan, the Trinity Mirror Pension Plan.
Valuations have been performed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 as at 31 December 2004.
Scheme liabilities have been calculated using a consistent projected unit valuation method and compared to the schemes assets at the 2 January 2005 market value.
Based on actuarial advice, the financial assumptions used in calculating the schemes liabilities and the total value of those liabilities under FRS 17 are: Assumptions Assumptions Assumptions as at as at as at 2 January 28 December 29 December 2005 2003 2002 % % % Discount rate 5.30 5.40 5.60 Ination rate 2.75 2.75 2.30 Pension increases: Pre 6 April 1997 pensions 2.75 to 5.00 2.75 to 5.00 2.30 to 5.00 Post 6 April 1997 pensions 2.75 to 3.25 2.75 to 3.25 2.30 to 3.00 Salary progression 4.00 4.30 4.10 Actuarial value of scheme liabilities million 1,371.6 1,325.2 1,105.8 The market value of assets in the Group s schemes and the expected rates of return on each class of assets are: Expected rate Market Expected rate Market Expected rate Market of return at Value at of return at Value at of return at Value at 2 January 2 January 28 December 28 December 29 December 29 December 2005 2005 2003 2003 2002 2002 % m % m % m UK equities 8.50 375.2 8.50 339.0 8.40 307.4 US equities 8.50 75.5 8.50 69.3 8.40 45.9 Other overseas equities 8.50 173.8 8.50 153.4 8.70 113.4 Property  Corporate bonds 5.30 67.5 5.30 76.6 5.60 36.4 Fixed interest gilts 4.50 287.1 4.80 267.9 4.50 339.8 Index-linked gilts 4.50 53.1 4.80 44.8 4.50 10.4 Cash  1,053.8 970.7 872.8 Pg 87 24 Pensions continued The overall net deficit between the assets of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes and the actuarial liabilities of those schemes at 2 January 2005 is as follows: Total as at Total as at Total as at 2 January 28 December 29 December 2005 2003 2002 m m m Fair value of schemes assets 1,053.8 970.7 872.8 Actuarial value of schemes liabilities 1,371.6 1,325.2 1,105.8 Schemes deficits 317.8 354.5 233.0 Deferred tax 95.3 106.4 69.9 Net schemes liabilities 222.5 248.1 163.1 The contributions made during the period totalled 36.5 million 52 weeks to 28 December 2003 25.2 million.
