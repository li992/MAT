40 Directors responsibilities Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year, which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and the profit or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to: select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed, and explained in the financial statements: and prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company and the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping accounting records, which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group, and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Companys website.
The work carried out by the auditors does not involve consideration of these matters, and accordingly the auditors accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Information published on the internet is accessible in many countries with different legal requirements.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
