e Fair values of financial assets and liabilities 2004 2003 The following table shows the book and fair values of the Book value Fair value Book value Fair value groups financial instruments at 31 December: m m m m Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations: i Cash at bank and in hand and current asset investments 1,207 1,207 1,026 1,026 i Long-term trade debtors 44 44 53 53 Other financial assets 11 1,251 1,251 1,080 1,080 i Bank loans and overdrafts 85 85 52 52 ii Commercial paper 220 220 205 205 v Bonds 752 783 751 778 iv Finance lease borrowings 30 30 69 72 v Canadian dollar loans 39 35 i Loan notes 2 2 2 2 i Other financial liabilities 182 182 151 151 1,310 1,337 1,230 1,260 v Non-equity minority interests 164 264 164 230 1,474 1,601 1,394 1,490 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the groups currency, interest rate profile and energy price exposures: ii Forward foreign currency contracts, interest rate swaps and v forward rate agreements 22 27 9 10 iii Energy derivatives 11 40 12 90 Derivative financial instruments held for trading: iii Energy derivatives 15 15 10 10 i Due to the nature and or short maturity of these financial instruments, book values approximated fair values.
In 2003 cash at bank and in hand and current asset investments included assets held by the AA with a book and fair value of 167 million.
ii Fair values have been determined by reference to closing exchange rates at 31 December.
iii The fair values of energy derivatives are calculated as the product of the volume and the difference between their strike or traded price and the corresponding market prices.
The market price is based upon the corresponding closing price of that market.
Where there is no organised market and or the market is illiquid, the market price is based upon management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors.
Energy derivatives held for trading includes both physical and financial energy contracts entered into for trading purposes.
iv The fair values of these financial instruments are based upon discounted cash flows, using discount rates based upon the groups cost of borrowing.
v Fair values have been determined by reference to closing prices at 31 December.
f Gains and losses on financial instruments held for trading The group engages in swaps, futures, forwards and options in gas, electricity and weather, for trading purposes.
Financial and physical trading positions are marked-to-market using externally derived market prices and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account.
This is not in accordance with the general provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires that these contracts be stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value or that, if revalued, any revaluation difference be taken to a revaluation reserve.
However, the directors consider these requirements would fail to provide a true and fair view since the marketability of energy trading contracts enables decisions to be taken continually whether to hold or sell them.
Accordingly the measure of profit in any period is properly made by reference to market values.
The effect of this departure from the historical cost convention on the financial statements for the year is an increase in profit amounting to 12 million 2003: 5 million and an increase in net assets at 31 December 2004 of 26 million 2003: 14 million.
