The Group does not recognise any accrued but unrealised gains or losses on currency or interest rate instruments until the relevant contract is concluded.
Save for 9.4m of unrealised net losses on interest rate derivative contracts due to mature after January 2005, all of the unrealised net losses of 37.9m at 31 January 2004 on currency and interest rate instruments are expected to be dealt with in the profit and loss account for the year to January 2005.

The defined benefit section is a funded arrangement which provides benefits based on final pensionable earnings which are salaries, overtime and annual performance bonuses and was closed to new members on 30 September 2000.
The defined contribution section is for all members who joined on or after 1 October 2000 and benefits are based on each individual members personal account.
The scheme has equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The Group continues to report its pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The most recent formal actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section was undertaken by an independent professionally qualified actuary as at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method and was updated as at 31 March 2003.
The principal financial assumptions which have the most significant effect on the computation of the pension costs are those related to the rate of return on the investments and the rates of increase in earnings and pensions.
These assumptions have been derived from market yields applying at the valuation date.
In particular, the investment return used relating to pre-retirement liabilities was three percentage points per annum in excess of the assumed rate of increase in earnings and the investment return used relating to post-retirement liabilities was two and a half percentage points per annum in excess of the assumed rate of pension increases.
Demographic assumptions have also been taken into account, in particular the general trend in mortality experience.
At 31 March 2003, the market value of the assets of the defined benefit section was 156m representing 68% of the liability for benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
A charge of 6m has been recognised in the year 2003: nil as a variation in regular pension cost in respect of this deficit.
The regular pension cost amounted to 10.3m 2003: 9.8m.
From February 2003 the Group increased employer contributions to the scheme from 12.3% to 12.5% and increased them further to 13.4% with effect from April 2003.
Employer contributions of 15.6m 2003: 12.7m were made in the year including a 5m 2003: 2.5m contribution in respect of the deficit on the defined benefit section and contributions of 1.1m 2003: 0.7m in respect of the defined contribution section.
Pension contributions for the Group will continue to be set at a level that takes account of the past service funding position of the scheme.
Full pension costs of the Group amounted to 17.6m 2003: 11.2m including the estimated cost of meeting unfunded unapproved pension liabilities relating to scheme members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by the Inland Revenue salary cap.
There is a pension accrual in the balance sheet of 20.9m 2003: 19.1m.
A further payment of 2.5m has been made since the year end as a contribution in respect of the defined benefit section deficit and the Board will keep the need for any further such payments under review.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The pension costs shown in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard, SSAP 24.
The new pension cost accounting standard, FRS 17, is applicable for year ending January 2006 and subsequent years.
Under transitional arrangements the Company is required to disclose the following information about the scheme and the treatment that would have been shown under FRS 17 in the accounts for the year ended 31 January 2004.
