We achieved or exceeded our targets for the year, and, in a generally favourable trading environment, all our businesses grew comparable trading profits and improved trading margins.
Cash flow was strong, and we reduced net debt to below 1bn.
2 Statement by the Chairman and the Chief Executive 2004 was a good year for ICI, aided by a favourable external trading environment a year in which we met or exceeded our strategic plan financial targets.
Trading margins improved from 7.4% to 8.6%, profit before tax, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation was up 16%, and net debt was reduced to below 1bn for the first time since 1996.
In 2004 ICI laid solid foundations, although there is still a long way to go before we reach the levels of performance to which we aspire.
Towards the end of 2003 we outlined our strategy, with a strong focus on profitable growth, and set clear financial targets.
At the core of our strategy is a belief that ICI can become the leader in formulation science, based on outstanding knowledge of our customers needs and the application of leading edge technology.
We will execute our strategy by improving executional capability, increasing focus across the business on cost and capital effectiveness and, at the same time, investing differentially in selected markets where we can achieve higher rates of profitable growth.
Progress in 2004 2004 was the first full year in which we have been executing our revised strategy.
We strengthened our business in growth markets in Asia and in the global electronics industry: National Starch and ICI Paints both delivered significant sales and profit growth, and Uniqemas profits improved markedly despite lower sales.
Quest, which had under-performed against expectations for the previous two years, made progress on many fronts and significantly improved its financial performance.
The sale of Quests Food Ingredients business was completed in April 2004, an important step which enables the business to concentrate its efforts on developing its core activities in flavours and fragrances.
In December 2004, we also announced the sale of National Starchs Vinamul Polymers business, a manufacturer of emulsion polymers.
The sale, completed in February 2005, reflects our view that our resources can be better utilised in businesses with greater potential for profitable growth.
Together, these actions continued to reposition the Group towards market segments where we believe we can maximise value creation for our shareholders.

Other profit improvement projects included supply chain and manufacturing initiatives in Paints and Uniqema, which resulted As a global business, serving a diverse range of stakeholders, in major savings.
we do not regard corporate governance as a distraction, but as something which is at the heart of our effective stewardship, In late 2003, ICI introduced group-wide Executive Boards, encapsulating as it does being mindful of both our financial covering a variety of functional disciplines, such as procurement, responsibility to our shareholders, and the need always to act manufacturing, safety, health and the environment, human with the highest standards of integrity and transparency.

We also benefited from leveraging shared experiences of manufacturing improvement programmes to accelerate the implementation of new projects.
With many initiatives now underway, the positive effect of these functional Peter B Ellwood CBE Chairman boards continues to be seen across ICI.
In 2004, we also made progress with legacy issues.
In particular, in October we announced the Groups exit from the Ineos Chlor business, marking the end of a significant chapter in the history of ICI.
People John D G McAdam Chief Executive In March we invited Baroness Noakes to join the Board as a NonExecutive Director.
In addition, in July, Charles Knott, Chairman and Chief Executive of Quest, was appointed to the Board as an Executive Director.
We also recruited a number of senior managers to augment the existing management team, and took steps to further strengthen our internal talent, launching a series of new development programmes.
The contribution of all employees to ICIs success in 2004 has been significant.
Without their dedication and commitment to achieving progress, the task of implementing ICIs strategic plan would have been impossible.
As we look to the future, their continued support and enthusiasm will be crucial to achieving further mutual success.
