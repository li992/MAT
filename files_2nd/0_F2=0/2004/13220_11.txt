The recoverability of deferred tax assets is supported by the expected level of future profits in the countries concerned.
Deferred tax assets of 91.4 million 2003: 76.0 million have not been recognised in respect of losses and other timing differences due to the uncertainty of the availability of suitable profits in the foreseeable future.
d Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is included in the balance sheet as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 Debtors receivable within one year 998 1,777 Debtors receivable after more than one year 5,157 873 6,155 2,650 2004 2003 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances 2,660 Tax losses 2,403 2,650 Other short term timing differences 1,092 6,155 2,650 9 LOSS EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Loss earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the year retained for equity shareholders by weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
In 2004 and 2003 share options were not included in the computation of diluted loss per share due to them being anti dilutive.
The calculation of basic and diluted loss earnings per share before exceptional items, amortisation of goodwill and profit on sale of subsidiaries has been included as it removes the effect of non recurring items which have had a disproportionate effect on the earnings of the business during the year.
In the opinion of the directors, this measure should therefore provide a better understanding of the underlying trading performance of the Group.
In August 2004, 196,958,408 new ordinary shares of 5p each were placed in the market at 62.25p per share.
The loss earnings per ordinary share are based on the following: 2004 2003 Loss earnings Loss earnings per ordinary share per ordinary share basic and diluted basic and diluted 000 p 000 p Loss for the year retained for equity shareholders 5,380 0.6 26,987 4.7 Exceptional cost of sales 6,620 0.8 Exceptional administration expenses 1,995 0.2 6,355 1.1 profit on sale of subsidiaries 133 0.0 6,585 1.1 Goodwill amortisation 2,037 0.2 Tax effect on exceptionals 2,188 0.3 profit loss for the year before exceptional items, amortisation of goodwill and profit on sale of subsidiaries 2,951 0.3 27,217 4.7 2004 2003 Number Number Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year used to calculate basic and diluted loss earnings per share 859,702,000 574,805,000 37 Regus Report & Accounts 2004 10 INTANGIBLE ASSETS Brand Goodwill Total 000 000 000 Cost At 1 January 2004 9,347 9,347 a and b Additions at cost 36,753 104,578 141,331 Exchange rate movements 2,585 6,608 9,193 At 31 December 2004 34,168 107,317 141,485 Amortisation At 1 January 2004 9,347 9,347 Charge for the year 651 2,037 2,688 Exchange rate movements 30 30 At 31 December 2004 621 11,384 12,005 Net carrying value At 31 December 2004 33,547 95,933 129,480 At 31 December 2003 a The brand comprises the fair value attributed to the HQ brand on its acquisition in August 2004.

20 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments are determined at Group level.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
During 2004, certain financial instruments were utilised to hedge the foreign exchange risk associated with the acquisition of HQ Global Holdings Inc.
These had all expired by 31 December 2004.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Historically the Group has occasionally used derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency and interest rate uctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposure to these risks.
The Groups debt is held at variable interest rates because early repayment of the debt is probable.
Surplus cash balances are invested to achieve maximum interest returns on a day to day basis.
The majority of the Groups net assets are in US dollars and euros, and the Group limits the translation exposure and resulting impact on shareholders funds by borrowing in US dollars.
The Group does not hedge the translation effect of exchange rate movements on the profit and loss account.
The Groups exposure to currency risk at a transactional level is minimal as the majority of day today transactions of overseas subsidiaries are carried out in local currency.
a Interest rate risk and currency prole of financial assets as at 31 December 2004 The following table analyses the currency and interest rate composition of the Groups financial assets.

Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying value because the majority are oating rate where payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.

c Foreign currency exposure as at 31 December 2004 As explained in the Financial Review, to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas, the Group borrows, where appropriate, in the local currencies arising from its net investments.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group companies and the Group.

Acquisition accounting has been applied in all cases.
The fair values currently established for all acquisitions made in the year to 31 December 2004 are provisional and will be reviewed based on additional information up to 31 December 2005.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
The goodwill arising on these acquisitions has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.
Acquisition of HQ Global Holdings Inc HQ On 20 August 2004, the Group acquired HQ Global Holdings Inc. a company incorporated in the USA.

Relief from Royalty approach was used as the valuation method.
Under this method the fair value is equal to the present value of attributed royalty income which is equal to the amount saved through the avoidance of royalty payments in perpetuity.
A 3% royalty rate and 15% weighted average cost of capital was used for the valuation.
b The valuation of property, plant and equipment was based on a cost and market valuation approach resulting in a fair value adjustment of 3.6 million.
c Incremental provision of 0.1 million was required to align HQ bad debt provision to Regus Group policy.
d Leasehold interest valuations were based on the difference between contract rent and market rent over the lease term discounted to net present value at a weighted average cost of 15%.
