108 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 7 Exceptional items continued Asset write downs in the year ended 30 June 2002 comprised: i 19 million in respect of two bottling facilities located in Canada LaSalle and Toronto following a decision to close the plants as part of the integration of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses: ii 11 million in respect of computer software and equipment following the adoption of common systems: and iii 6 million in respect of sundry fixtures and fittings which became redundant following the integration.
The assets were written off on the basis of their anticipated value to the group, taking account of their expected future use, based on internal management estimates.
LaSalle was a former Seagram plant and Toronto a Diageo plant.
Both closures were announced in the year ended 30 June 2002.
Toronto was closed in the year ended 30 June 2003 and LaSalle was significantly run down towards eventual closure.
b In the four years ended 30 June 2004, costs were incurred on the integration of the Guinness UDV spirits, wine and beer businesses to create premium drinks.
As a result of the charges to exceptional items, it was anticipated that approximately 750 jobs would be lost of which approximately 700 had been terminated by 30 June 2004.
An analysis of the movement in the Guinness UDV integration liability is as follows: Liability at Cash Liability at 30 June 2003 payments 30 June 2004 million million million Employee related 11 7 4 Legal and professional 6 4 2 Other 8 7 1 25 18 7 c Effective from 30 June 2003, the group relinquished its rights to distribute Bass Ale in the United States, resulting in an exceptional gain before taxes of 57 million.
d On 5 February 2002, Diageo and Jos Cuervo SA Jos Cuervo agreed to terminate their litigation in respect of a change of control issue which Jos Cuervo claimed arose as a result of the merger of GrandMet and Guinness, and new arrangements were formalised for the distribution rights for the Jos Cuervo brands in the United States which now extend to 2013.
The settlement in favour of Jos Cuervo involved the return of the groups 45% interest in Jos Cuervo and a net cash payment of 85 million.
The exceptional charge in the year ended 30 June 2002 of 220 million before tax comprised the write off of the groups investment in Jos Cuervo of 115 million, related goodwill previously written off to reserves of 20 million and the net cash payment to Jos Cuervo.
e In the year ended 30 June 2002, costs of 17 million were incurred on the reorganisation of beer production facilities in Ireland.
These costs were in respect of a provision for additional pension benefits for certain employees.
f During the year ended 30 June 2002, in anticipation of the disposal of the Burger King business, the franchisee loan financing arrangements were restructured.
This resulted in an exceptional charge for credit enhancement, performance and service fees of 21 million.
ii Share of associatesprofits The groups share of exceptional items in respect of associates comprises restructuring costs of 7 million 2003 18 million: 2002 31 million incurred by General Mills following the acquisition of the Pillsbury business and 6 million 2003 3 million: 2002 10 million in respect of Mot Hennessy.
iii Disposal of fixed assets Disposal of fixed assets includes 41 million 2003 41 million: 2002 nil in respect of the dilution of the investment in General Mills, following the issue of additional shares by General Mills, a 6 million share of a gain on the disposal of tangible assets from associates 2003 and 2002 nil and, in 2003, a 2 million loss on the disposal of tangible fixed assets 2002 22 million loss.

The groups quick service restaurants business Burger King was sold on 13 December 2002 for $1.5 billion 0.9 billion.
This sale generated a loss before taxes of 1,457 million, after writing back goodwill previously written off to reserves of 673 million.
Following the disposal, Diageo retained $213 million 117 million of subordinated debt, with a 10 year maturity, from the entity owning Burger King.
In addition, Diageo has guaranteed up to $850 million 467 million of borrowings of Burger King see note 29.
109 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 7 Exceptional items continued iv Sale of businesses continued b On 18 June 2004, International Multifoods Corporation was acquired by The JM Smucker Company, as a result of which the provision being carried in respect of $200 million 110 million of debt guaranteed by Diageo has been reviewed and revised.
An exceptional gain of 29 million has been recognised in respect of this revision.
The gain on the disposal of Pillsbury in the year ended 30 June 2003 primarily represents additional consideration that the company received from General Mills in connection with the disposal.
c The net loss from the sale of businesses was after charging goodwill previously written off, attributable to the businesses sold, of 13 million 2003 682 million: 2002 1,748 million of which in 2003, 673 million arose on the disposal of Burger King 2002 1,671 million on the disposal of Pillsbury.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property or intangible assets or on the sale of properties or intangible assets where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
The total amount unprovided is 36 million 2003 21 million: 2002 12 million.
Such tax would become payable only if the property or intangible asset was sold without it being possible to claim further rollover relief and this is not expected to occur in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, as earnings are re-invested by the group and no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
It is not considered practicable to calculate the amounts involved.

Capitalised brands are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives and have not been amortised.
These brands are protected in all of the major markets where they are sold by trademarks, which are renewable indefinitely.
There are not believed to be any legal, regulatory or contractual provisions that limit the useful life.
The nature of the premium drinks industry is that obsolescence is not a common issue, with indefinite brand lives being commonplace and Diageo has a number of brands that were originally created more than 100 years ago.
Accordingly the directors believe that it is appropriate that the brands are treated as having indefinite lives for accounting purposes.
An annual review is carried out by the directors to consider whether any brand has suffered an impairment in value.
The principal acquired brands included above are Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff, Crown Royal, Captain Morgan and Windsor Premier.

General Mills prepares its financial statements in US dollars and under US GAAP to the end of May each year.

From that date Diageo no longer has significant influence over its investment and accordingly the investment in General Mills has been reclassified as a fixed asset investment rather than equity accounted as an associate.
In the year ending 30 June 2005 Diageo will only recognise the dividends received from General Mills in its profit and loss account.
Prior to 23 June 2004, the 21% net investment in General Mills has been accounted for by aggregating the acquired share of the fair value of General Mills prior to the acquisition of General Mills with the retained interest in Pillsbury pre-transaction net assets.
Goodwill associated with the retained interest in Pillsbury of $648 million 356 million, written off to reserves up to 1 July 1998, will be recycled through the profit and loss account on a subsequent sale of shares in General Mills.
At 30 June 2004, General Millsshare price was $47.53 26.12 valuing the groups interest at $3,755 million 2,063 million.
On 23 October 2002, Diageo sold call options to General Mills at a strike price of $51.56.
These options expire in October 2005 and give General Mills the option to purchase 29 million of its own shares held by Diageo, subject to certain limitations.
The premium of $89 million received in respect of the options has been deferred and is included in accruals and deferred income in other creditors.

The above loans are stated net of unamortised finance costs of 14 million 2003 48 million, of which 30 million related to the zero coupon bonds 2004.
The weighted average interest rate for short term borrowings, before interest rate protection, at 30 June 2004 was 5.4% 2003 3.3%: 2002 3.6%.
118 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 18 Financial instruments and risk management Financial instruments comprise net borrowings see note 17 together with other instruments deemed to be financial instruments including certain fixed asset investments, long term debtors, other long term creditors and provisions for liabilities and charges.
Disclosures dealt with in this note exclude short term debtors and creditors where permitted by the accounting standard on derivatives and other financial instruments FRS 13. i Currency risk management The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign subsidiaries.
The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps.
During the year ended 30 June 2004, the groups policy was to hedge currency exposure on its net assets before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% for US dollars, 90% for euros and 50% for other significant currencies where a liquid foreign exchange market exists.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net assets before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency net borrowings and foreign exchange swaps are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments, in accordance with SSAP 20.
For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised at the same time as the underlying transaction.
At 30 June 2004, as a result of the transaction and translation exposure cover outlined above, the group had the following outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts: Foreign currency amount Percentage of total Purchase Sell Total US dollar Euro Maturity million million million % % Year Transaction 325 1,249 1,574 47 32 2004-2006 Translation 2,607 3,819 6,426 73 17 2004-2005 At 30 June 2004, the group had no outstanding cross currency interest rate swaps.
At 30 June 2003, as a result of the transaction and translation exposure cover outlined above, the group had the following outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts: Foreign currency amount Percentage of total Purchase Sell Total US dollar Euro Maturity million million million % % Year Transaction 466 1,347 1,813 46 26 2003-2004 Translation: Foreign currency contracts 3,439 4,593 8,032 71 21 2003-2004 Cross currency interest rate swaps 208 160 368 57 43 2003 At 30 June 2004, there were no material monetary assets or liabilities in currencies other than the functional currencies of group companies, having taken into account the effect of forward contract and other derivative financial instruments that have been utilised to match foreign currency exposure.
ii Interest rate risk management The group has an exposure to interest rate risk and within this category of market risk, is most vulnerable to changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing long term fixed rate bonds, medium term notes and floating rate commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps and swaptions.
The profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings is maintained according to the duration measure that is equivalent to an approximate 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
The number of years within the amortising profile depends on a template approved by the board.
The floating element of US dollar borrowing is partly protected using interest rate collars.
Following the June 2002 policy review, the level of interest rate collars will continue to reduce.
Remaining interest rate collars as at 30 June 2004 will take up to approximately two years to expire.
In addition, where appropriate, the group may use forward rate agreements to manage short term interest rate exposures.
Swaps, swaptions, forward rate agreements and collars are accounted for as hedges.
Such management serves to increase the accuracy of the business planning process.
Diageo has a target range for cash interest cover defined as operating profit before exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and share of associatesprofits, and after dividends received from associates, over net interest cash flow including minority interest dividends of five to eight times and under the current economic environment Diageos intention is to be at the higher end of this range.
The top limit may, however, be exceeded on certain occasions.

120 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 18 Financial instruments and risk management continued Interest bearing financial liabilities comprise bonds, medium term notes, commercial paper issued, money market loans, repurchase and forward rate agreements, net obligations under finance leases, bank overdrafts and certain provisions.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid consist of: provisions for liabilities and charges payable after one year in respect of employee incentive plans and provisions for business disposals of 74 million 2003 58 million : other creditors of 210 million 2003 180 million : and derivative financial instruments of 18 million 2003 98 million.
Interest bearing financial assets comprise cash, short term liquid investments with financial institutions and certain fixed asset investments, loans and debtors.
Financial assets on which no interest is paid include certain fixed asset investments, loans and long term debtors.
The foreign currency swaps, in the table above, adjust the currency basis of borrowings as part of the groups policy to hedge its exposure to fluctuations on translation into sterling of its foreign currency net assets see i above.
The foreign currency swaps are short term in nature and therefore have a floating interest rate basis.
They are shown after taking account of fixed interest rate swaps which convert 426 million 2003 600 million of euro floating rate financial liabilities arising from foreign currency swaps into euro fixed rate financial liabilities.
At 30 June 2004, the group had the following portfolio of interest rate derivative instruments: Weighted Weighted average average Receive fixed Pay fixed fixed remaining Forward notional notional interest rate maturity starting Maturity million million % Years Year Year Currency instrument US dollar: Interest rate swaps 2,187 5.9 4.1 2004-2022 Interest rate swaps 1,536 5.7 2.0 2004-2013 Euro: Interest rate swaps 359 4.9 1.5 2004-2007 Forward starting swaps 67 4.61.4 2005-2006 2007 Sterling: Interest rate swaps 700 6.5 0.9 2005 At 30 June 2003, the group had the following portfolio of interest rate derivative instruments: Weighted Weighted average average Receive fixed Pay fixed fixed remaining Forward notional notional interest rate maturity starting Maturity million million % Years Year Year Currency instrument US dollar: Interest rate swaps 3,484 5.5 3.7 2003-2022 Interest rate swaps 2,097 5.8 1.5 2003-2006 Euro: Interest rate swaps 18 4.7 1.0 2004 Interest rate swaps 486 4.8 1.7 2003-2006 Forward starting swaps 132 4.4 2.4 2004-2006 2007 Sterling: Interest rate swaps 700 6.5 0.9 2003-2005 In addition to the above swaps, at 30 June 2003, a cross currency interest rate swap also existed with a principal of 160 million, which effectively converted a euro medium term note matured 2003 to US dollars.
In addition to the interest rate and cross currency swaps reflected in the tables above for 30 June 2004, the group has 1,349 million notional principal of US dollar interest rate collars which mature between 1 July 2004 and 1 July 2006 and have floors of 4.81% 6.32% and caps of 5.89% 8.75%.

The maturity category due within one yearincludes an amount of 220 million $400 million in respect of 7.45% 2005 2035 guaranteed notes.
The notes are redeemable at the option of the holder on 15 April 2005.
If the holders do not redeem at this time, the notes then become due in 2035.
It is not currently anticipated that the note holders will redeem the notes in 2005.
The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: 2004 2003 million million Expiring within one year 1,044 1,182 Expiring in more than two years 714 788 1,758 1,970 Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin, which is dependent on the period of drawdown.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the above short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges and related sale and lease back provisions.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associatesprofits, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.
122 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 18 Financial instruments and risk management continued iv Fair values The estimated fair values of borrowings, guaranteed preferred securities, associated derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets at 30 June 2004 are set out below.
The fair values of quoted borrowings and guaranteed preferred securities are based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivatives, financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets are estimated using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end by discounting the future cash flows to the net present values.
These are based on rates obtained from third parties.
The fair value of the groups investment in General Mills, included in other financial assets at 30 June 2004 in the table below, is calculated using the quoted share price at 30 June 2004.
2004 2003 Net carrying Estimated Net carrying Estimated amount fair value amount fair value million million million million Primary financial instruments: Borrowings due within one year including overdrafts 2,001 2,077 3,563 3,680 Borrowings due after one year 3,316 3,386 2,981 3,294 Cash at bank and liquid resources 1,167 1,167 1,191 1,191 Guaranteed preferred securities 312 320 343 370 Derivatives interest rate contracts: Interest rate swaps positive values 18 119 387 718 negative values 15 96 14 211 Collars 11 28 18 78 Other interest rate contracts 4 5 Derivatives foreign exchange contracts: Transaction positive values 53 55 negative values 15 31 Balance sheet translation positive values 48 48 138 136 negative values 31 29 16 17 Other: General Mills options see below 63 41 63 70 Other financial liabilities 295 295 256 256 Other financial assets 1,836 2,372 325 325 On 23 October 2002, Diageo sold call options to General Mills giving General Mills the option to purchase 29 million of General Millsshares held by Diageo, subject to certain limitations.
The call options have a strike price of $51.56 and expire in October 2005.
The estimated fair value of the call options at 30 June 2004 was 41 million $75 million.
The estimated fair value of the call options was derived using a Black Scholes model using market volatility, share price and interest rates as at 30 June 2004.
The difference between net carrying amount and estimated fair value reflects unrealised gains or losses inherent in the instruments based on valuations at 30 June 2004.
The volatile nature of the markets means that values at any subsequent date could be significantly different from the values reported above.
123 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 18 Financial instruments and risk management continued v Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
The table below shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses on financial instruments, and deferred gains and losses in respect of financial instruments and terminated financial instruments used as hedges, at the beginning and end of the year.

Counterparties for such transactions entered into during the year have a long term credit rating of A or better.
The group monitors its credit exposure to its counterparties, together with their credit ratings, and, by policy, limits the amount of agreements or contracts it enters into with any one party.
The notional amounts of financial instruments used in interest rate and foreign exchange management do not represent the credit risk arising through the use of these instruments.
The immediate credit risk of these instruments is generally estimated by the fair value of contracts with a positive value.
Cash at bank and liquid resources principally comprise money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
The investments are with counterparties having strong credit ratings.
At 30 June 2004, approximately 11% and 38% of the groups cash at bank and liquid resources of 1,167 million were invested with United Kingdom and United States based counterparties, respectively.
At 30 June 2004, approximately 29% and 23% of the groups trade debtors of 1,148 million were due from United Kingdom and United States based counterparties, respectively.

These provisions will predominantly be utilised within the next few years.
b Deferred taxation was 390 million see note 21. c Other provisions were 246 million, including: 37 million in respect of vacant properties: 107 million for the discounted value of an onerous contract on the acquisition of the Seagram spirits and wine businesses on 21 December 2001: and 20 million for employee incentive plans 2003 43 million: 119 million: and 55 million, respectively.
The vacant property provision is based on the estimated discounted rental shortfall over the terms of the leases.
The onerous contract provision was established in February 2002 and will be utilised over the 10 year duration of the contract.
The employee incentive plan provision will be utilised within the next few years.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Following the evaluation of the groups tax position during 2004, it was determined that a deferred tax asset of 245 million in respect of the UK post employment deficit at 30 June 2004 could be recognised on the consolidated balance sheet, of which 224 million was credited to the statement of total recognised gains and losses during 2004.
Included in deferred tax assets are 26 million 2003 34 million in respect of losses which are carried forward and are available to reduce future tax liabilities of certain subsidiaries in a number of foreign jurisdictions.
Under a US GAAP presentation, the losses comprise a deferred tax asset of 336 million 2003 292 million less a valuation allowance of 310 million 2003 258 million.
4 million of these losses, net of valuation allowance, have expiration dates through to 2012 and 22 million can be carried forward indefinitely.

Such proceedings are expected to be similar to actions that have been brought in recent years by foreign governments, including the Departments, against a number of consumer products companies.
Of these four actions, three have been dismissed.
The fourth has yet to proceed to the stage where motions to dismiss are filed.
It remains the directorsintent that any proceedings of this kind that might be brought against Diageo will be strenuously defended.
iii Alcohol advertising litigation Five putative class actions have been filed against Diageo, Diageo North America, Inc. Paddington, Ltd and a large group of other beverage alcohol manufacturers and importers.
Four of the actions are now pending in federal district courts two in Ohio, one in North Carolina and one in the District of Columbia.
The fifth action is pending in Colorado state court.

The named plaintiffs seek to pursue their claims on behalf of two classes of plaintiffs i parents or guardians of underage drinkers who bought alcohol beverages during the period from 1982 to the present and ii all parents and guardians of children currently under age 21.
Plaintiffs allege several causes of action, including violations of state consumer protection laws, unjust enrichment, negligence and civil conspiracy.
The complaints seek money damages including fines, punitive damages and disgorgement of profits and injunctions against the alleged targeting of minors in advertising.
Diageo North America and the other domestic defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints in Ohio, North Carolina and Colorado.
Plaintiffs have not yet responded to these motions.
Diageo and other foreign defendants did not join in these motions because of outstanding objections to personal jurisdiction.
In the District of Columbia case, the Beer Institute, Inc. moved to dismiss the complaint on 23 December 2003.

Where capitalised goodwill and intangible assets are regarded as having limited useful economic lives, their cost is amortised on a straight line basis over those lives up to 20 years.
Where intangible assets are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised but are subject to annual impairment reviews.
Under US GAAP, up to 30 June 2001, intangible assets have been capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised through the statement of income over their useful economic lives, not exceeding 40 years.
On 1 July 2001, the group adopted the provisions of SFAS No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets and ceased to amortise goodwill from this date.
The standard requires that intangible assets arising on acquisitions with definite useful lives, are amortised to their estimable residual values over their estimated useful lives.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually in lieu of being amortised.
Goodwill arising on business combinations is tested for impairment at least annually in lieu of amortisation.
b Accounting for the merger of the former GrandMet Group and the former Guinness Group For UK GAAP, the merger of the GrandMet Group and the Guinness Group was accounted for under merger accounting principles pooling of interests where the results, cash flows and balance sheets of both entities, having made adjustments to achieve uniformity of accounting policies, were aggregated with no adjustment to fair value.
Under US GAAP, the merger was accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet with an effective acquisition date of 31 December 1997.
Consequently the Guinness Group assets and liabilities were recorded at fair values on 31 December 1997.
Under US GAAP, the excess of the consideration over the fair value of the net assets has been allocated firstly to identifiable intangible assets based on their fair values with the remainder allocated to goodwill.
Fair value adjustments to the recorded amounts of inventories, net of deferred tax, are expensed in the period in which the inventory is sold.
c Restructuring and integration costs On the acquisition of a business, certain costs of reorganising the acquired business are required to be taken to the profit and loss account under UK GAAP, but are treated as fair value adjustments to goodwill under US GAAP.
139 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued d Pensions and other post employment benefits Under UK GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost is charged to operating profit.
The interest cost being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the period and the expected return on assets for the period calculated using the market value of assets are charged credited to other finance charges in the profit and loss account.
Any amount arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The surplus or deficit in post employment plans at the balance sheet date is reported as part of the groups consolidated net assets.
Under US GAAP, the pension cost for the period is based on an actuarial valuation at the start of the financial period.
The current service cost, the interest being the unwinding of the discount on the funds liabilities for the year and the expected return on assets for the year calculated using a smoothed market value of assets are all charged credited to operating profit.
The cumulative amounts arising from changes in the assumptions used for the actuarial valuation at the commencement of the year and those at the end of the year and any differences between the actual return on the plans assets and the expected return on the plans assets are amortised through operating profit over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
Only when the plan is in deficit, calculated on the plans accrued rather than projected liabilities, is the liability included in the groups consolidated net assets.
If the plan is in surplus, the groups consolidated net assets include a prepayment or provision which is the difference between the cumulative profit and loss account charges and the cumulative cash contributions made to the plan.
e Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares Under UK GAAP, the contingent value right, received in connection with the disposal of Pillsbury, was treated as a contingent asset and was therefore not recognised until the realisation of the contingent asset became virtually certain.
The group received cash in settlement of the contingent value right on 1 May 2003, and as a consequence it was accounted for in the consolidated profit and loss account in the year ended 30 June 2003.
Also under UK GAAP, the premium received from the sale of options to General Mills over 29 million ordinary shares of Diageos holding in that company has been deferred in the balance sheet pending exercise or lapse of the options.
Under US GAAP, the contingent value right and the option contract represent derivatives and were accordingly held at their estimated fair values at the balance sheet dates with changes in fair value included in the statement of income.
f Other derivative instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments for risk management purposes.
Under UK GAAP, changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives, derivatives hedging forecast transactions and currency option cylinders are not recognised until realised.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives hedging the translation of net assets of overseas operations are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Under US GAAP, all derivatives are carried at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Certain of the groups derivatives qualify for and are designated as hedges under US GAAP, which defers the effect on net income from gains and losses arising from changes in their fair values, to coincide with the timing of the recognition of the hedged item.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of derivatives which do not qualify for US GAAP hedge accounting treatment are charged or credited in determining net income under US GAAP.
g Disposals of businesses Applying the accounting differences between UK and US GAAP can result in changes to the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities.
As a consequence of these different carrying values, including related tax balances, different gains or losses may arise on the subsequent disposal of the assets.
In addition, the timing of the recognition of a loss on a disposal may be different under UK and US GAAP.
On 31 October 2001, the group disposed of The Pillsbury Company and acquired an equity investment in General Mills, Inc.
The gain on this disposal under US GAAP was higher than that recorded under UK GAAP because of such differences in carrying value, particularly in respect of intangible assets and deferred tax.
The investment in General Mills under US GAAP is also greater than under UK GAAP.
On 23 June 2004, Diageo and General Mills amended the Stockholders Agreement to permanently eliminate Diageos right to board representation, following the resignation of Diageos representatives on the General Mills board.
From that date, Diageo believes that it no longer has significant influence over General Mills and accordingly the investment has been reclassified as a fixed asset investment under UK GAAP as an available for sale security under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, available for sale securities are held on the balance sheet at fair value with changes in the fair value included in other comprehensive income.
In connection with the disposal of Pillsbury in the year ended 30 June 2002, Diageo guaranteed the debt of a third party to the amount of $200 million 110 million.
Under UK GAAP, Diageo provided for the amounts which it could have paid to settle the potential liability or transfer it to a third party as a cost of the transaction.
On 18 June 2004, International Multifoods Corporation was acquired by the JM Smucker Company, as a result of which the provision being carried in respect of the guarantee has been reviewed and revised.
Under US GAAP, Diageo had deferred the element of the gain on disposal of Pillsbury equivalent to the amount guaranteed.
As a result of the acquisition of International Multifoods Corporation by JM Smucker, the deferred gain under US GAAP has been recognised in the year ended 30 June 2004, and a provision, against the guarantee, equal to that under UK GAAP has been established.
Under UK GAAP, the sale of Burger King was accounted for as a disposal and the results prior to the disposal date are presented within discontinued operations.
Under US GAAP, the transaction was not accounted for as a disposal due to the size of the investment made by the buyer and Diageos continuing involvement through the guarantee provided by Diageo in respect of the acquisition finance.
140 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Under US GAAP, the results of Burger King prior to 13 December 2002 the completion date are presented as continuing operations in the income statement, and on the completion date of the transaction, a charge for impairment has been recognised rather than a loss on disposal.
Following the completion date, Diageo does not recognise profits of Burger King in its income statement but will, generally, reflect losses as an impairment charge against the assets retained in the balance sheet.
In the US GAAP balance sheet, the total assets and total liabilities of Burger King at 30 June 2004 including consideration deferred under US GAAP classified within other long term assets and other long term liabilities were each 1.2 billion 2003 1.3 billion.
Under US GAAP, the transaction will be accounted for as a disposal when the uncertainties related to the guarantee provided in respect of the acquisition finance have been substantially resolved and or the buyers cumulative investment meets or exceeds minimum levels.
h Revaluation of land and buildings UK GAAP allows the periodic revaluation of land and buildings.
Professional valuations of certain of the groups properties were carried out in 1988 which, under US GAAP, have not been reflected in the consolidated financial statements.
i Employee share options Under UK GAAP, for employee share options, compensation cost charged to the profit and loss account is determined as the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of the award and the amount the employee has to pay for the shares.
Compensation cost so determined is allocated on a straight line basis to expense over the vesting period.
Under US GAAP, compensation cost for fixed awards i. e. awards under which both the exercise price and the number of shares are fixed is the same as under UK GAAP.
Compensation cost for variable awards including awards subject to future performance conditions is measured as the difference between the market price at the period end and the exercise price and is based on the number of awards expected to vest.
j Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, the proposed dividends on ordinary shares, as recommended by the directors, are deducted from shareholdersequity and shown as a liability in the balance sheet at the end of the period to which they relate.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are only deducted from shareholdersequity at the date of declaration of the dividend.
k Deferred taxation UK GAAP requires that no provision for deferred tax should be made on the acquisition of a business where an asset acquired has a different tax basis.
US GAAP requires a deferred tax liability to be set up on all assets separately identified, apart from goodwill.
In addition, under US GAAP, adjustments due to changes in the assumptions underlying the recoverability of deferred tax assets associated with items that may have been recognised in the other comprehensive income statement are recognised in net income.
Under UK GAAP, equivalent movements may be reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Other minor differences exist including differences related to rolled over gains on the disposal of fixed assets.
l Earnings per ordinary share Under UK GAAP and US GAAP, the calculation of earnings per ordinary share is generally consistent and is based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Earnings per American Depositary Share are calculated on the basis of one American Depositary Share representing four ordinary shares.
m Discontinued operations UK and US GAAP have different criteria for determining whether a business is a discontinued operation.
Under UK GAAP, the turnover and operating profit of a discontinued operation are disclosed separately in the profit and loss account but as part of turnover and operating profit.
Under US GAAP, sales and net income arising from discontinued operations are disclosed separately from sales and net income from continuing operations.
Pillsbury and Burger King have been treated as discontinued operations under UK GAAP but included within continuing operations under US GAAP.
n Turnover UK GAAP turnover sales in US terminology for the year ended 30 June 2004 was 114 million 2003 128 million: 2002 140 million higher than turnover under US GAAP, as the accounting treatment for joint arrangements between the group and LVMH is different.
Under UK GAAP, the group includes in turnover its attributable share of turnover of joint arrangements, measured according to the terms of the arrangement and sales to joint arrangements by Diageo companies are eliminated on consolidation.
Under US GAAP, joint arrangements have been accounted for under the equity method of accounting and the groups share of sales of the joint arrangements has not been included as part of group sales.
Sales to joint arrangements by Diageo companies are accounted for as part of turnover.
Amendment to the 2003 US GAAP financial information Certain US GAAP financial information for the year ended 30 June 2003 has been amended to adjust Diageos US GAAP treatment of deferred tax associated with minimum pension liabilities.
The amendment resulted in a deferred tax charge of 53 million being reclassified from other comprehensive deficit to net income and a reversal of deferred tax of 118 million previously charged to other comprehensive deficit.
The overall effect, for the year ended 30 June 2003, is therefore a reduction in net income of 53 million, a reduction in the comprehensive deficit of 118 million and an increase in shareholdersequity of 118 million.
The amendment does not affect operating income or cash flow under US GAAP, nor does it affect Diageos principal financial information prepared under UK GAAP.
All relevant disclosures under US GAAP have been restated as appropriate.
141 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued US GAAP statements of income Statements of income under US GAAP for the three years ended 30 June 2004 are set out below: 2003 2004 restated 2002 million million million Sales 8,777 9,153 10,760 Cost of sales 5,069 5,062 6,261 Gross profit 3,708 4,091 4,499 Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,793 2,235 2,433 Integration and restructuring costs 40 202 130 Bass distribution rights 57 Jos Cuervo settlement 194 Derivative instruments in respect of General Mills shares 28 4 166 Burger King impairment charges and transaction costs 38 750 135 Losses on disposal of fixed assets 38 40 22 Gains on disposals of businesses 97 16 1,843 Other operating income 4 22 36 Operating income 1,928 955 3,630 Earnings from unconsolidated affiliates net of income taxes 252 254 152 Interest expense 210 609 950 Interest income 40 286 418 Income before income taxes 2,010 886 3,250 Income taxes 220 360 609 Minority interest charges 90 92 87 Net income 1,700 434 2,554 Sales and cost of sales include 388 million 2003 320 million: 2002 254 million of excise duties charged as a tax on sales, and cost of sales also includes 1,821 million 2003 1,846 million: 2002 1,865 million of excise duties charged as production taxes.
Research and development expenditure was written off to selling, general and administrative expenses in the period in which it was incurred.
142 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued Movements on US GAAP shareholdersequity 2003 2004 restated million million Shareholdersequity in accordance with US GAAP at beginning of the year 9,344 11,316 Net income 1,700 434 Minimum pension liability 325 770 Deferred tax relief on minimum pension liabilities 5 34 Dividends 802 762 New share capital issued 4 4 Repurchase of own shares for cancellation 306 852 Net change in employee share trust arrangements 17 67 Unrealised gain on available for sale securities 270 Exchange adjustments 226 7 Shareholdersequity in accordance with US GAAP at end of the year 10,287 9,344 Under US GAAP, cumulative exchange adjustments charged against retained surplus are separately identified.
This does not result in any difference in total shareholdersequity between UK and US GAAP.
US GAAP balance sheet A summary consolidated balance sheet under US GAAP at 30 June 2004 is set out below.
2003 2004 restated million million Total current assets 5,431 5,677 Property, plant and equipment 1,944 1,935 Brands 7,030 7,280 Goodwill 3,164 3,273 Other intangible assets 73 85 Other long term assets 5,429 5,821 Total assets 23,071 24,071 Short term borrowings 2,019 3,574 Other current liabilities 2,834 3,134 Long term borrowings 3,381 3,149 Other long term liabilities 4,014 4,341 Minority interests 536 529 Shareholdersequity 10,287 9,344 Total liabilities and shareholdersequity 23,071 24,071 143 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued US GAAP cash flows The groups consolidated financial statements include a consolidated statement of cash flows in accordance with FRS 1 Cash flow statements revised 1996.
The objective and principles of FRS 1 Revised are similar to those set out in the US accounting standard SFAS No.
The principal difference between the standards is in respect of classification.
Under FRS 1 Revised, the group presents its cash flows separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
95 requires only three categories of cash flow activity being operating, investing and financing.
Cash flows arising from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under FRS 1 Revised would be included as operating activities.
95, capital expenditure and financial investment would be included as an investing activity, and equity dividends paid would be classified as a financing activity.
In addition, cashfor the purposes of the cash flow statement under FRS 1 Revised, includes bank overdrafts but excludes liquid resources current asset investments held as readily available disposable stores of value.
Under US GAAP, bank overdrafts are classified as borrowings and the movements thereon are included in financing activities.
Liquid resources, with a maturity of three months or less at the date acquired, are considered to be cash equivalents and the movements thereon are included in the overall cash movement under US GAAP.
A summarised consolidated cash flow statement under US GAAP is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 million million million Cash inflow from operating activities 1,729 1,570 1,380 Cash outflow inflow from investing activities 331 747 1,021 Cash outflow from financing activities 1,350 2,375 2,571 Cumulative effect of the implementation of FIN 46 R 53 Increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 101 58 170 Exchange adjustments 24 31 48 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of the year under US GAAP 699 788 1,006 Cash and cash equivalents at end of the year under US GAAP 776 699 788 Statement of comprehensive income deficit under US GAAP Under UK GAAP the group presents a consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses which is similar to a statement of comprehensive income required by US GAAP.
Comprehensive income, under US GAAP, for the three years ended 30 June 2004 is as follows: 2003 2004 restated 2002 million million million Net income 1,700 434 2,554 Exchange adjustments 226 7 266 Minimum pension liabilities 325 770 569 Unrealised gains on available for sale securities 270 2,069 329 1,719 Tax charge credit in respect of minimum pension liabilities 5 34 171 Comprehensive income deficit 2,064 295 1,890 144 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued US GAAP intangible assets An analysis of movements in intangible assets for the two years ended 30 June 2004 is as follows: Other Brands Goodwill intangibles Total million million million million Cost At 30 June 2002 9,011 4,624 284 13,919 Exchange adjustments 288 72 5 365 Additions 17 6 12 35 Burger King transaction 755 910 123 1,788 Disposals 84 2 86 At 30 June 2003 7,901 3,646 168 11,715 Exchange adjustments 269 60 3 332 Additions 1 2 3 Adjustment to tax relating to acquisitions 47 47 Disposals 8 8 At 30 June 2004 7,632 3,532 167 11,331 Amortisation At 30 June 2002 893 801 132 1,826 Exchange adjustments 36 10 2 48 Provided during the year 16 16 Burger King transaction 236 418 63 717 At 30 June 2003 621 373 83 1,077 Exchange adjustments 19 4 1 24 Provided during the year 12 12 Disposals 1 1 At 30 June 2004 602 368 94 1,064 Net book value At 30 June 2004 7,030 3,164 73 10,267 At 30 June 2003 7,280 3,273 85 10,638 At 30 June 2002 8,118 3,823 152 12,093 In the year ended 30 June 2003, under UK GAAP, the sale of Burger King was accounted for as a disposal.
On completion of the transaction, under US GAAP a charge for impairment was recognised and Diageo included the total assets and liabilities of Burger King within other long term assetsand other long term liabilities.
145 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued An analysis of movements in the net book value of goodwill for the year ended 30 June 2003, by segment, is as follows: Premium Quick service drinksrestaurants Total million million million Goodwill net book value At 30 June 2002 3,315 508 3,823 Exchange adjustments 44 18 62 Additions 4 2 6 Burger King transaction 492 492 Disposals 2 2 At 30 June 2003 3,273 3,273 The differences in the shareholdersequity reconciliation between UK and US GAAP for brands, goodwill and other intangibles are attributable to historical cost differences of 3,687 million, 3,497 million and 106 million, respectively 2003 3,691 million, 3,606 million and 108 million, respectively, less differences on accumulated amortisation of 602 million, 359 million and 74 million, respectively 2003 621 million, 366 million and 68 million, respectively.
In addition, differences in relation to share of associatesbrands and goodwill are attributable to historical cost differences of nil and 403 million, respectively 2003 nil and 427 million, respectively, less differences on accumulated amortisation of 33 million and 38 million, respectively 2003 32 million and 40 million, respectively.
Additions to other intangibles of 2 million in the year ended 30 June 2004 are in respect of distribution rights which will be amortised over a weighted average period of 10 years 2003 10 years.
The estimated amortisation expense for the other intangibles currently in the balance sheet for the succeeding five years is as follows: For the year ending 30 June 2005 12 million For the year ending 30 June 2006 11 million For the year ending 30 June 2007 10 million For the year ending 30 June 2008 7 million For the year ending 30 June 2009 4 million New accounting standards and pronouncements in the United States SFAS No.
132 R Employers Disclosures About Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued a revised SFAS No.
The group has provided the additional disclosures in respect of the groups post retirement plans in note 5 and note 32 to the consolidated financial statements.
FIN 46 and FIN 46 R Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46 and in December 2003 a revised interpretation was issued FIN 46 R which clarified certain provisions of FIN 46 and provided for further scope exemptions.
FIN 46 R requires variable interest entities to be consolidated by the party that has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the entitys expected losses and or receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns or both the primary beneficiary.
A variable interest entity VIE has one or more of the following characteristics: 1 the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support being provided: 2 the equity holders lack the ability through voting rights or otherwise to make decisions about an entitys activities: or 3 the equity holders lack the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity or lack the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity.
At 30 June 2004 the group was a partner with a subsidiary of LVMH Mot Hennessy-Louis Vuitton SA LVMH in Schieffelin & Somerset Co S&S, a partnership which marketed, distributed and sold, throughout the United States, certain premium and agency brands of Mot Hennessy and the group.
The creditors of the partnership have no recourse to the general credit of the group.
At 30 June 2004 the group was the primary beneficiary of the partnership and has consolidated the balance sheet of S&S at that date.
Following the termination of this joint arrangement S&S is not expected to be consolidated under FIN 46 R in the year ended 30 June 2005.
The group has a number of other similar joint arrangements with LVMH in France and the Far East, all involved in the marketing, distributing and selling of alcoholic beverages.
The balance sheets of these arrangements have also been consolidated in the groups consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2004.
Diageo has complied with FIN 46 R in the groups US GAAP consolidated balance sheet as at 30 June 2004.
The implementation of FIN 46 R has had no impact on the US GAAP consolidated shareholdersequity or net income.
03-6 Participating Securities and the Two-Class Method under FASB Statement No.
128, Earnings per Share In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB issued EITF Issue No.
This issue addressed changes in the reporting and calculation requirements for earnings per share, providing the method to be used when a company has granted holders of any form of security rights to participate in the earnings of the company along with the participation rights of common stockholders.
The group has reviewed the contractual rights granted for stock options and concluded that EITF 03-6 does not affect the groups reporting and disclosure.
146 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued FSP No.
106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 In December 2003, the United States Congress enacted into law the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act.
The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare Medicare Part D, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree health care benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. In May 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No.
106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FSP 106-2.
The group is in the process of determining the impact of this issue on the business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity.
Therefore, in accordance with FSP 106-2, the US GAAP accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net period postretirement benefit cost included in the consolidated financial statements do not reflect the effects of the Act.
This is because the group is currently determining whether the benefits conferred by the US plans are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D under the Act.
03-1 The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments In June 2004, the EITF issued EITF Issue No.
The issue includes determining the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to debt and equity securities within the scope of SFAS No.
115 Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS No.
115 and equity securities that are not subject to the scope of SFAS No.
115 and not accounted for under the equity method of accounting.
The Task Force reached a consensus that the application guidance in EITF 03-1 should be used to determine when an investment is considered impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss.
The guidance also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealised losses that have not been recognised as other than temporary impairments.
These disclosure requirements became effective for periods ended prior to 30 June 2004.
The recognition and measurement guidance of EITF 03-1 should be applied to other than temporary impairment evaluations in reporting periods beginning after 15 June 2004.
The group considers that there were no unrealised losses requiring additional disclosures at 30 June 2004 and will evaluate, as the need arises, the impact of EITF 03-1 on the business, results of operations, financial position, and liquidity.
Share option schemes Under US GAAP, the group has complied with APB No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees.
The group has also complied with the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
123 Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation as amended by SFAS No.
If the group had elected to recognise compensation expense based upon the fair value at grant date for equity awards made in the three years ended 30 June 2004 under these plans consistent with the alternative methodology set out in SFAS No.
123, net income and basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share would be the pro forma amounts indicated below.

The TSR and DSIP plans are not subject to the disclosure requirements of SFAS No.
Pension plans The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The plans generally are of the defined benefit type.
The significant plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada.
The principal plans are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The measurement dates used to calculate the figures in the US GAAP financial information are the appropriate balance sheet dates.
The totals of the groups periodic pension charge income for defined benefit plans and the funded status of the significant plans, calculated in accordance with SFAS No.

There are a number of pension plans in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United States and Canada where the plan assets are less than the accumulated benefit obligations at 30 June 2004.
With respect to these plans, the aggregated projected benefit obligations, accumulated benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets were 3,654 million, 3,466 million and 2,744 million, respectively.
In addition to the minimum pension liabilities included in the table above there was a further 7 million 2003 nil of minimum pension liabilities in respect of other plans.
149 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 32 Reconciliation to US generally accepted accounting principles continued The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups benefit obligations for the significant plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the net periodic costs for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June: US plans Non-US plans 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 % %% % %% Rate of general increase in salaries 3.5 3.5 6.25 4.4 4.0 4.5 Discount rate for plan liabilities 6.2 5.9 7.5 5.6 5.2 5.9 Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 7.5 6.7 9.5 7.7 7.1 7.8 For the years ended 30 June 2004 and 2003 for the United Kingdom and United States plans, there are, in addition to the above percentages, age related promotional increases.
Contributions are made by the group, on actuarial advice, to provide assets sufficient to cover the benefit entitlements of plan participants.
Generally, benefits are based on a formula recognising length of service and earnings close to retirement.
Postretirement benefits other than pensions The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with postretirement insurance.
The plans are generally unfunded.
The liability in respect of these benefits is assessed by qualified independent actuaries under the projected unit method and is included in other long term liabilities.
The postretirement medical and life insurance costs for the plans in the United States, calculated in accordance with SFAS No.

The weighted average medical inflation for beneficiaries is 8% reducing by 1% per year to 5% 2003 9% reducing by 1% per year to 5%.
The impact on the service and interest cost of the postretirement cost and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligations of a 1% increase and a 1% decrease in future medical care inflation is as follows: 2004 2003 2002 million million million Impact of 1% increase in medical care inflation rates: Aggregate of service cost and interest cost 1 1 1 Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at end of the year 9 8 8 Impact of 1% decrease in medical care inflation rates: Aggregate of service cost and interest cost 1 1 1 Accumulated postretirement benefit obligations at end of the year 8 7 7 33 Post balance sheet event As of 1 July 2004, the Schieffelin & Somerset joint venture with Mot Hennessy in North America ceased marketing and distribution of Diageo and Mot Hennessy products.
The products will in future be marketed and distributed directly by the respective partners and the partnership net assets will be distributed to them during the first quarter of the year ending 30 June 2005.
