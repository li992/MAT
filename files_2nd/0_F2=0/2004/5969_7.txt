Statement of Directors Responsibilities Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss for that period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to: a select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently: b make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent: c state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements: and d prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company and group will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act.
They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
