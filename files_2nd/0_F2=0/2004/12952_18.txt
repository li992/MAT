The aim was to improve the tradeability of the companys shares and to equalise a shares value before and after the share split.
A special resolution was passed at the annual general meeting in April 2004, which was subsequently approved by the Court in Jersey, to extinguish accumulated losses by reducing the companys share premium account by US$100 million.
Other reserves includes the mark-to-market valuation of financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges.
