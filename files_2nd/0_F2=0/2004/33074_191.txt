18 Pensions and similar obligations Description of plans In most countries the Group operates dened benefit pension plans based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
The majority of these plans are externally funded.
The Group also provides other post-employment benets, mainly post-employment medical plans in the United States.
These plans are predominantly unfunded.
The Group also operates a number of dened contribution plans, the assets of which are held in external funds.
Accounting policies Accounting for pensions and similar obligations is in accordance with United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benets FRS 17.
This requires that the operating and nancing costs of dened benefit plans are recognised separately in the profit and loss account: service costs are systematically spread over the service lives of employees, and nancing costs are recognised in the periods in which they arise.
Variations from expected costs, arising from the experience of the plans or changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The costs of individual events such as past service benefit enhancements, settlements and curtailments are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
The liabilities and, where applicable, the assets of dened benefit plans are recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
The charges to the profit and loss account for dened contribution plans are the company contributions payable and the assets of such plans are not included in the Group balance sheet.
All dened benefit plans are subject to regular actuarial review using the projected unit method, either by external consultants or by actuaries employed by Unilever.
Group policy is that the most important plans representing over 75% of the dened benefit liabilities are formally valued every year and other principal plans accounting for approximately a further 15% of liabilities have their liabilities updated each year.
Group policy for other plans requires a full actuarial valuation at least every three years.
Asset values for all plans are updated every year.
Healthcare In December 2003 the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernisation Act became law in the US.
Under the provisions of this Act, the Groups US healthcare benefit plans will be able to benefit from a subsidy towards the cost of prescription drugs.
Following a review of our healthcare plans in 2004 we determined that the benets of this legislation are available to all except one of our plans without any amendment to those plans.
As a consequence, a reduction in liability of 52 million has been recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The impact on the ongoing service cost is a reduction by an immaterial amount.

The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the benefit obligations vary according to the country in which the plan is situated.
The assumptions, weighted by liabilities, used to value the principal dened benefit pension plans covering approximately 90% of pension liabilities the principal pension plans and plans providing other post-employment benets, together with the expected long-term rates of return on assets, weighted by asset value, are: 31 Dec 2004 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 Principal Other Principal Other Principal Other dened postdened postdened postbenefit employment benefit employment benefit employment pension benefit pension benefit pension benefit plans plans plans plans plans plans Discount rate 5.10% 5.70% 5.50% 6.10% 5.70% 6.50% Ination assumption 2.40% n a 2.40% n a 2.30% n a Rate of increase in salaries 3.60% 4.50% 3.70% 4.50% 3.60% 4.30% Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.20% n a 2.20% n a 2.20% n a Rate of increase for pensions in deferment where provided 2.60% n a 2.60% n a 2.60% n a a Long-term medical cost ination n a 4.80% n a 4.90% n a 4.90% Expected long-term rates of return: Equities 7.80% 8.40% 8.20% Bonds 4.50% 5.00% 4.90% Others 6.30% 6.40% 5.40% a The valuations of other benefit plans generally assume a higher initial level of medical cost ination, which falls from 11.20% to the long-term rate within the next six years.
Assumptions for the remaining dened benefit plans vary considerably depending on the economic conditions of the country where they are situated.
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension plans.

In 2004, the benets paid in respect of unfunded plans amounted to 311 million 2003: 295 million: 2002: 260 million.
Company contributions to funded plans were at a reduced level for a number of years resulting from the generally strong stock market performance of the 1990s.
Following the falls in stock markets in 2000, 2001 and 2002, contribution holidays have ended for many Unilever plans and the aggregate level of contributions is now rising.
Contributions are subject to periodic review.
In 2004, contributions to funded dened benefit plans, including one-off contributions of 186 million, amounted to 462 million 2003: 170 million: 2002: 140 million.
In 2003 a refund of 7 million was received in Finland out of previously irrecoverable surplus.
Total contributions to funded plans and benefit payments by the Group in respect of unfunded plans are expected to be about 675 million in 2005 2004: 815 million.

The accounting methodology however is not the same as under FRS 17, since under US GAAP all costs are recognised in operating profit and certain cost items are amortised in the profit and loss account rather than recognised immediately.
The disclosures below show the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and balance sheet impact, as well as the periodic expense, cash ows and related economic assumptions associated with the dened benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans as computed in accordance with SFAS 87 and SFAS 106.
Measurement dates All plan assets are valued at fair value at the balance sheet date.
Liabilities in respect of the most important pension plans comprising approximately 75% of the pension liabilities are subject to actuarial valuations every year.
The valuations use membership data for the current year with the liability projected forward to the balance sheet date.
Valuations of all other plans are carried out every three years and in the case of the other principal pension plans, comprising approximately a further 15% of the liabilities, the valuations are updated each year.

Asset allocation The asset allocation for the Groups principal pension plans at 31 December 2003 and 2004, target allocation for 2005, and expected long-term rates of return by asset category are as follows: Long-term Target Percentage Percentage expected percentage of plan of plan return on allocation assets at assets at plan assets at for 31 December 31 December 31 December 2005 2004 2003 2004 Long-term asset category: Equity securities 61 63 63 7.80% Debt securities 27 24 25 4.50% Property 99 9 6.30% Other 34 3 5.00% Total 100 100 100 6.80% Equity securities include Unilever securities amounting to 24 million 0.2% of total plan assets and 44 million 0.3% of total plan assets at 31 December 2004 and 2003 respectively.
Investment strategy The Groups investment strategy in respect of its funded pension plans is implemented within the framework of the various statutory requirements of the territories where the plans are based.
The Group has developed policy guidelines for the allocation of assets to different classes with the objective of controlling risk and maintaining the right balance between risk and long-term returns in order to limit the cost to the company of the benets provided.
To achieve this, investments are well diversied, such that the failure of any single investment would not have a material impact on the overall level of assets.
The plans invest the largest proportion of the assets in equities which the Group believes offer the best returns over the long term commensurate with an acceptable level of risk.
The Group also keeps a proportion of assets invested in bonds, property and cash.
Most assets are managed by a number of external fund managers, with a small proportion managed in-house.

This includes both mandatory and discretionary payments.
In addition, a further 43 million is expected to be contributed to dened contribution plans.
The table below shows the expected benefit payments from dened benefit plans.
The benets paid from funded plans include amounts funded by employee contributions.
The benets paid in respect of unfunded plans are made from the Groups cash resources.
