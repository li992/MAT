The Directorshave conducted a review of the Groups accounting policies and have confirmed that they are the most appropriate for the purposes of giving a true and fair view of the Groups results and that there have been no changes from last year.
However, the method of providing depreciation of tangible fixed assets has been changed from reducing balance to straight line, following a review by the Directors and to bring the Group into line with comparable companies.
The new method resulted in an 11 million lower charge than would have been the case under the previous basis.
Basisofconsolidation The group accounts consolidate the accounts for the year to 31 December 2004 of the Company and its subsidiaries unless those subsidiaries are subject to severe long-term restrictions on the ability of the Group to control them.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss accountfrom the date ofacquisition or to the date of disposal.
In the case of acquisitions during the year the acquisition method of accounting is used.
Where material, profits or losses are analysed as discontinued operations where businesses are sold or closed by the date on which the accounts are approved.
Where businesses are treated as sold or closed in the current year, the prior years analyses are restated to reflect those businesses as discontinued.
Foreign currencies The results and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated to sterling at average exchange rates.
Profit and loss transactions are translated at average exchange rates except in the case of material transactions where actual spot rate may be used if it more accurately reflects the underlying substance of the transaction.
Where practicable, transactions involving foreign currenciesare protected by forward contracts.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the appropriate forward contract rate or, if not covered, at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Differences on revenue transactionsare dealt with through the profit and loss account.
The exchange rates used for the currencies most important to the Groups operations are: 1 euro 1 US$ 2004 average 1.47 1.83 2003 average 1.45 1.64 2004 year-end 1.41 1.92 2003 year-end 1.42 1.79 Financial instruments The Groups accounting policy for derivatives is to recognise in the group profit and loss account gains and losses on hedges of revenues or operating payments only as they crystallise.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange risks and hedge a proportion of its investment in overseas subsidiaries and investments denominated in foreign currencies, where such hedging can be carried out on an economically acceptable basis.
Such financial instruments are treated as hedges against the underlying assets or liabilities, with matching accounting treatments and cash flows.
All gains or losses are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses until the instrument and the underlying hedged investment are sold, when the profit or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of financial instruments to hedge these exposures are dealt with in the group profit and loss account.
Any instruments no longer designated as hedges are restated at market value and any gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account.
The book values of short-term debtors and creditors are deemed to be the same as their fair values and have been excluded from the financial instrument disclosures other than those on currency exposures.
Sales Sales shown in the profit and loss account exclude value added taxes and generally represent the invoiced value of goods and services charged to customers.
Invoices are raised when goods are despatched or when the risks and rewards of ownership otherwise irrevocably passes to the customer.
In Aerospace, on long-term development and or supply contracts, revenues are recognised based on the value of work done at the achievement of predetermined contractual or other milestones.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 : GKN plc 47 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Research and development costs Except as noted below, revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred.
On major aerospace contracts that demonstrablyhave a life of more than ten years, net non-recurring initial costs consisting of design, development and tooling are categorised as stocks and are charged to the profit and loss account over a maximum period of ten years from the startof serial production.
On other contracts, design and development costs are written off as incurred and tooling over three years.
Reorganisation costs Costs of reorganisation and redundancy, which are not part of a fundamental restructuring, are charged against operating profit in the period when the announcement is made.
Intangible assets goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation consists of the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of businesses acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed prior to 31 December 1997 has been eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after that date is capitalised as a fixed asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
To the extent that the carrying value exceeds the value in use, determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows, goodwill is written down to the value in use and an impairment charge is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Where an acquired business is sold and goodwill has been previously deducted from reserves, the goodwill is taken into accountin calculating the profit or loss on sale.
Tangible fixed assets Cost Tangible fixed assets are valued at cost or valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Cost comprises the purchase price plus costs directly incurred in bringing the asset into use but excludes interest.
Where freehold and long leasehold properties were carried at a valuation at 23 March 2000, the date of implementation of FRS 15, these values have been retained as book values in accordance with the transitional arrangements of that standard.
Where assets are in the course of construction at the balance sheet date they are classified as capital work in progress.
Transfers are made to other asset categories when they are available for use.
Depreciation During the year the Group changed from providing depreciation on plant and machinery on a reducing balance basis to a straight line basis.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or assets in the course of construction.
In the case of all other categories of asset, depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the course of the financial year.
Depreciation is applied to specific classes of asset so as to reduce them to their residual values over their estimated useful lives.
The range of main rates of depreciation used are: Straight line years Freehold buildings Up to 50 Steel powder production plant 18 General plant, machinery, fixtures, fittings and equipment 6 to 15 Computers and major software 3 to 5 Commercial vehicles and cars 4 to 5 Leasehold properties are amortised by equal annual instalments over the period of the lease or 50 years, whichever is the shorter.
Leased assets Where fixed assets are financed by leasing arrangements which give rights approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if theyhad been purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The rentals payable are apportioned between interest, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital which reduces the outstanding obligation.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss accountas incurred over the lease term.
Impairments Fixed assets are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11.
Any impairment is charged to the profit and loss account as it arises and is reported in operating profit.
Joint ventures and associated companies Joint ventures, although not subsidiaries, are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise joint control with its partners under a contractual arrangement.
Associates are those businesses in which the Group has a long-term interest and is able to exercise significant influence through its representation on the board of directors.
48 GKN plc : ANNUAL REPORT 2004 Joint ventures and associates are accounted for in accordance with FRS 9 whereby the profit and loss account includes, at the appropriate line, the Groups share of their sales, operating profit, exceptional items, interest and tax.
They are stated in the balance sheet at the Groups share of their equity.
Where the size criteria of FRS 9 are met additional information is given by wayof note to the accounts.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value, due allowance being made for obsolete or slow-moving items.
Cost includes the relevant proportion of works overheads assuming normal levels of activity.
Taxation Provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability or asset arises as a result of transactions that have occurred by the balance sheet date and give rise to an obligation to pay more tax in future, or a right to pay less tax in future.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that it may be regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised are not discounted.
No provision is made for any additional tax which might arise on remittance of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates except where distribution of such profits is planned.
Pensions and post-retirement benefits The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK and in certain overseas companies pension arrangements are made through externally funded defined benefit schemes, the contributions to which are based on the advice of independent actuaries or in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
In other overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The amount charged to the profit and loss account is calculated, in accordance with SSAP 24, by independent actuaries as being the expected cost of providing pensions on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the Group expects to derive benefit from the employees services.
Additionally, certain amounts are charged in accordance with the rules of defined contribution pension plans.
The impact on the balance sheet, profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses of the adoption of FRS 17, together with the assumptions made in computing that impact, are shown by way of note.

The costs detailed in the table above relate to the first nine months of that plan and predominantly reflect asset write-downs where clear definitive plans and intent exist or actions have been taken in relation to specific plants.
Other restructuring costs reflect charges incurred in the year, primarily in relation to employee redundancies, together with provisions for such costs where external announcements and commitments had been made by 31 December 2004.
Cash outflow in the year in respect of these costs was 16 million.
The cash outflow in the year in respect of 2002 and earlier restructuring activities was 5 million.
Notwithstanding the restructuring measures noted above, further deterioration in the market share of its major customers and significantly higher raw material costs have adversely impacted the US Powder Metallurgy business so that, as part of a review of carrying values of fixed assetsin accordance with FRS 11, it has been necessary to make further impairment charges as shown above.
The charges have been calculated based on a value in use assessment.
The discount rate applied to pre-tax cash flows was 11%.
The 2003 exceptional charge relates to asset write-downs arising in Powder Metallurgy 83 million and Aerospace Services 8 million.

20 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES The disclosures made in notes 20 and 21 should be read in conjunction with the discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to financial instruments in the operating and financial review on page 29.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Groups operations are excluded from the following disclosures other than those on currency exposures.
After taking into account the various interest rate and forward foreign exchange contracts entered into by the Group, the effective currency and interest rate exposure of the Groups borrowings were as follows: Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Weighted average time Floating rate Fixed rate Total average for which rate borrowings borrowings borrowings interest rate is fixed m m m % Years At 31 December 2004 Sterling 6 702 708 7.0 10.9 US dollar 42 42 4.3 9.5 Euro 12 1 13 0.3 5.7 Other 30 2 32 3.5 90 705 795 6.9 10.9 At 31 December 2003 Sterling 9 702 711 7.0 11.9 US dollar 28 28 4.3 10.5 Euro 90 1 91 0.3 6.7 Other 92 2 94 4.5 219 705 924 6.9 11.9 The interest rates on floating rate borrowings are determined by reference to applicable LIBORs.
58 GKN plc : ANNUAL REPORT 2004 The maturity of the Groups borrowings at 31 December 2004 was as follows: 2004 2003 m m Bank loans, overdrafts and other borrowings repayable as follows: Within one year 51 36 One to two years 12 12 Two to five years 38 175 After five years 677 685 778 908 Finance leases repayable as follows: Within one year 3 1 One to two years 1 2 Two to five years 2 1 After five years 11 12 17 16 Total borrowings 795 924 At 31 December 2004 the Group had the following undrawn committed borrowing facilities: 2004 2003 m m Expiring within one year 32 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years Expiring in more than two years 582 614 582 646 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS a Financial assets Bank and cash balances Short-term loans and deposits 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Sterling 8 30 736 21 US dollar 13 8 Euro 35 19 9 2 Other 52 34 7 17 108 91 752 40 The bank and cash balances comprise 69 million 2003 20 million in respect of short-term balances earning interest and 39 million 2003 71 million in respect of balances which are non-interest earning.
The weighted average interest rate at year-end on the interest earning cash balances, which was all floating and set by reference to relevant LIBORs, was 1.3% 2003 2.6%.
Surplus cash is deposited for short-term periods typically with a maturity of less than three months or in money market funds.
The weighted average interest rate on the deposit account balances is 4.7% 2003 3.2%.
b Currency exposures As explained in the operating and financial review on page 29, the Groups objective in managing the translational currency exposures arising from its overseas investments is to ensure that changes in the sterling equivalent of assets and liabilities caused by currency movements do not have a material impact on the sterling value of shareholders equity.
At 31 December 2004, there were 775 million of notional borrowings created through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge such exposures denominated in euro 46%, US dollars 44% and yen 10% mirrored by indirectly created sterling deposits.
Net gains and losses arising from these translational currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Interest differentials resulting from the use of financial instruments to hedge those exposures are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
After taking into account the effects of forward foreign exchange contracts, at 31 December 2004 there were no material currency exposures that give rise to gains or losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 : GKN plc 59 NOTES ON THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 21 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED c Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The comparison of book and fair values of all the Groups financialassets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 is set out below: 2004 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value m m m m Financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations Bank and cash balances 108 108 91 91 Short-term loans and deposits 752 752 40 40 Short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term borrowings 51 51 36 36 Long-term borrowings 727 777 872 933 Finance leases 17 17 16 16 Financial instruments held to manage interest rate and currency exposures Interest rate swaps and similar instruments 1 1 Forward foreign exchange contracts 5 5 88 Financial instruments held to hedge currency exposures on expected future trading transactions Forward foreign exchange contracts 29 6 At 31 December 60 40 785 839 In addition to the above, the Group has a loan to another company, shown within short-term debtors, with a book value of 15 million and fair value of 15 million.
The following methods and assumptionswere used in estimating fair values for financial instruments: Short-term borrowings, cash and deposits approximate to book value due to their short maturities.
Long-term borrowings: Bank and other loans carrying fixed rates of interest the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2004.
Bonds quoted closing market value.
Interest rate instruments discounted cash flow analysisbased on interest rates derived from market yield curves.
Forward exchange contracts and currency swaps marked-to-market.
d Hedges As explained in the operating and financial review on page 29, the Groups policy is to hedge the exposures summarised below.
Translational currency exposures are hedged where the costs and results of such hedging are economically acceptable.
Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, swaptions and forward rate agreements.
Transactional and translational currency exposures using forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps.
Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for hedging both transactional and translational currency exposures and the movements therein, are as follows: Net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2003 43 36 7 Gains and losses from previousyears recognised in 2004 36 24 12 Gains and losses arising before 1 January 2004 that were not recognised in 2004 7 12 5 Gains and losses arising in 2004 that were not recognised in that year 51 16 35 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2004 58 28 30 Expected to be recognised in 2005 37 18 19 Expected to be recognised after 2005 21 10 11 58 28 30 In 2004 net translational gains and losses arising on forward foreign exchange contracts have been recognised through reserves and matched with offsetting movements on translational foreign exchange variances.

The total amount unprovided for is 15 million 2003 15 million.
It is not anticipated that any such tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax which might arise on the remittance of retained profits of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures except where the distribution of such profits is planned.

Prior to becoming a subsidiary, TFS was accounted for as an associated undertaking.
In accordance with FRS 2 and in order to give a true and fair view, goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each purchase of the identifiable assets and liabilitiesof the interest purchased.
This is a departure from the method specified in the Companies Act, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value at the date that TFS became a subsidiary.
The statutory method would not give a true and fair view as it would result in the Groups share of TFS retained reserves, during the period that it was an associate, being characterised as goodwill.
The effect of this departure is to increase revaluation reserves by 2 million and to increase goodwill by 2 million.
During the year, TFS contributed sales of 173 million and operating profit of 6 million as a subsidiary.
The contribution to group cash flow was a net cash inflow of 22 million from operating activities, payments of nil in respect of interest, payments of nil in respect of tax and paymentsof 9 million in respect of capital expenditure and financial investment.
26 POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS SSAP 24 The Groups pension arrangements comprise various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes throughout the world.
In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded defined benefit scheme.
An independent actuarial valuation of the scheme wascarried out as at April 2003 using the projected unit method.
The market value related basis assumed a yield pre-retirement of 7.5% per annum, which exceeded the annual rate of increases in pensionable salaries by 3.4% 2.65% in respect of future service with a yield post-retirement of 5% per annum 4.75% in respect of future service, which exceeded pension increases by 2.4% 2.15% in respect of future service.
The aggregate market value of the assets at the valuation date was 1,297 million and the aggregate funding level on an ongoing basis was 69%.
Company contributions in the year to the UK scheme totalled 154 million 2003 54 million compared with the regular cost in accordance with the application of SSAP 24 of 9 million 2003 10 million and included a special advance payment of 100 million.
The total charge to operating profit before exceptional items was 48 million 2003 33 million.
A further charge of 3 million 2003 nil was made against operating exceptional items relating to the restructuring programme.
A cumulative advance payment of 198 million 2003 93 million is included in long-term debtors.
In certain overseas companies funds are retained within the business to provide for retirement obligations.
The annual charge to provide for these obligations, which is determined in accordance with actuarial advice or local statutory requirements, amounted to 39 million 2003 35 million.
The Group operates a number of retirement plans which provide certain employees with post-retirement healthcare benefits.
The liability for providing these benefits is recognised on an actuarial basis and included in post-retirement and other provisions disclosed in note 22.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the US plans as at 31 December 2004, the date of the lastreview, are shown below within the FRS 17 disclosures.
The principal actuarial assumptions for the valuation of the main UK plan at 31 December 2003, the last date on which a valuation was carried out, were that the discount rate would be 6.25% per annum and that medical costs would initially increase by 9.5% per annum for three years falling to 4.3% over the next five years.
The Group operates a number of small defined contribution schemes outside the United Kingdom.
The charge to the profit and loss account in the year was 3 million 2003 4 million.
