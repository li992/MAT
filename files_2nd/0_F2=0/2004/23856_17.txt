Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting Policies A summary of the accounting policies used is set out below.
The Company has prepared its accounts in accordance with the Association of Investment Trust Companies AITC Statement of Recommended Practice: Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies SORP issued in January 2003. a Basis of accounting The accounts have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will be granted and that the continuation vote is approved.
b Income Income from equity investments is credited to the revenue account on the date on which the right to receive the payment is established.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Franked dividends are accounted for net of any tax credit.
Unfranked investment income includes tax deducted at source.
Interest receivable on short-term loans and deposits, interest payable and expenses of management are dealt with on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
c Special dividends Special dividends are treated as a repayment of capital unless there is sufficient evidence that they should be treated as revenue.
d Expenses and finance costs All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis and are charged in full to the revenue account within the Statement of Total Return.
Finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis and in accordance with the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 4 Capital Instruments.
e Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable.
f Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves realised and unrealised.
g Valuation of investments Listed investments are valued at middle market prices.
Unlisted investments are valued at market prices ruling where an organised market in such investments exists: other unquoted investments are included at Directors estimate of fair value.
Where a price is not readily available the holding would be valued at cost unless circumstances indicate a different valuation is warranted.
In general, valuations are increased where a substantial arms length transaction has occurred subsequent to acquisition, at a price higher than cost.
Valuations are decreased where subsequent transactions have taken place at a price lower than cost or where Fidelitys Fair Value Committee is aware that the company in question is experiencing operating difficulties.
h Capital reserve realised Gains and losses on the realisation of investments and realised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve realised.
Capital reserve unrealised Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end and unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature are accounted for in the capital reserve unrealised.
i The capital net return before finance costs and taxation for the year ended 31 December 2003 has been restated from 115,438,000 to 110,464,000.
This restatement has been necessary as exchange gains losses are now included as part of the net return before finance costs rather than a finance cost.
This restatement has no impact on the Companys return on ordinary activities for the year ended 31 December 2003.

In pursuit of this objective the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Equity shares held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Euro borrowings to finance operations The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Short-term debtors and other short-term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
The Board meets quarterly to consider the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable risk reward profile.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values.
Investments are held at mid market value.
The Directors consider this equates to fair value and for cash, book value approximates to fair value due to short maturity of the instruments.
The exceptions are the long term fixed rate unsecured loans, whose fair values as at 31 December 2004 given below have been calculated by discounting future cash flows at 2 year euro interest rates.
2004 2003 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 4.96% per annum 36,901 35,310 39,766 35,309 Fixed rate unsecured loan @ 5.54% per annum 29,839 28,249 32,439 28,248 66,740 63,559 72,205 63,557 36 Interest rate risk The Company finances its operations through share capital raised.
In addition, financing has been obtained through two euro denominated fixed rate unsecured bank loans, which fall due for repayment on 29 December 2006.
The Company is therefore not exposed to a financial risk arising as a result of any increase in euro interest rates on these loans.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The Companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has substantial cash balances of 4,400,445 2003: 1,140,668 denominated in euros.
The rate of interest on the cash balances is currently 2.2% 2003: 2.2%, consequently the risk of a decrease in cash interest earned is low.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities excluding short-term creditors, as at 31 December 2004 and 2003 was as follows: 2004 2003 fixed rate financial fixed rate financial liabilities liabilities Currency 000 000 Euro 63,559 63,557 2004 2003 weighted average weighted average interest rate interest rate Currency Euro 5.22% 5.22% 2004 2003 fixed rate financial fixed rate financial liabilities: weighted liabilities: weighted average period for average period for which rate is fixed which rate is fixed Currency Euro 24 months 36 months Foreign currency risk The Company's total return and balance sheet can be affected by foreign exchange movements because the Company has assets and income which are denominated in currencies other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The Board has identified three principal areas where foreign currency risk could impact the Company: Movements in rates affecting the value of investments and loans Movements in rates affecting short-term timing differences Movements in rates affecting the income received The Company does not hedge the sterling value of investments or other net assets priced in other currencies by the use of derivatives.
However, it has increased finance available to the Company for its investment activities with foreign currency borrowings, thereby hedging part of the movements which are a result of exchange movements.
The Company might also be subject to short-term exposure from exchange rate movements, for example between the date when an investment is bought or sold and the date when settlement of the transaction occurs.
Income denominated in foreign currencies is converted to sterling on receipt.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in note 12 to the accounts.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 and 2003: 2004 2003 000 000 After more than one year but less than two years 63,559 - After more than two years but less than five years - 63,557 63,559 63,557 The Company does not have any undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
Counterparty risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver either the shares on a purchase or the cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
There is also a counterparty risk associated with deposit takers.
38 The Company buys and sells investments on a delivery versus payment basis to manage risk.
The Company only buys and sells investments through brokers which have been approved by the Manager as an acceptable counterparty.
Additionally, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any broker at any time, the limits being reviewed on a regular basis.
21 Contingent liabilities and capital commitments There were no contingent liabilities or capital commitments as at 31 December 2004 2003: nil.
22 Transactions with the Manager The Directors have complied with the provisions of FRS8 which require disclosure of related party transactions and balances.
Fidelity Investments International is the Manager and Secretary of the Company and details of the services provided and fees paid are given on pages 15 and 16.
