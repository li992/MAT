142 Additional information for shareholders BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Listings The principal listing of BT Groups ordinary shares is on the London Stock Exchange.
American Depositary Shares ADSs, each representing 10 ordinary shares, have been issued by JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Depositary for the American Depositary Receipts ADRs evidencing the ADSs, and are listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
ADSs also trade, but are not listed, on the London Stock Exchange.
Trading on the New York Stock Exchange is under the symbol BTY.
The prices are the highest and lowest closing middle market prices for BT ordinary shares, as derived from the Daily Ofcial List of the London Stock Exchange and the highest and lowest sales prices of ADSs, as reported on the New York Stock Exchange composite tape.
Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the pound sterling and the US dollar affect the dollar equivalent of the pound sterling price of the companys ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange and, as a result, are likely to affect the market price of the ADSs on the New York Stock Exchange.
Capital gains tax CGT The rights issue in June 2001 and the demerger of mmO in November 2001 adjusted the value for capital gains 2 tax purposes of BT shares.
Rights issue An explanatory note on the effects of the rights issue on the CGT position relating to BT shareholdings is available from the Shareholder Helpline see page 153.
143 Additional information for shareholders BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Demerger of mmO capital gains tax calculation 2 The confirmed ofcial opening prices for BT Group and mmO shares on 19 November 2001 following the 2 demerger were 285.75p and 82.75p, respectively.
This means that, of the total combined value of 368.50p, 77.544% is attributable to BT Group and 22.456% to mmO.
Accordingly, for CGT calculations, the base cost 2 of your BT Group shares and mmO shares is calculated by multiplying the acquisition cost of your 2 BT shareholding by 77.544% and 22.456%, respectively.
b Under the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme and the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan, 7 million and 39 million shares respectively were held in trust on behalf of 105,657 and 89,129 participants respectively who were beneficially entitled to the shares.
137 million shares were held in the corporate nominee BT Group EasyShare on behalf of 124,279 beneficial owners.
c 208 million shares were represented by ADSs.
Analysis by size of holding is not available for this holding.
d 14.3% of the shares were in 1,572,571 individual holdings, of which 135,432 were joint holdings, and 85.7% of the shares were in 31,694 institutional holdings.
So far as the company is aware, the company is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by the UK Government or any other foreign government or by any other natural or legal person severally or jointly.
There are no arrangements known to the company the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the company.
At 14 May 2004, there were 8,590,507,813 ordinary shares outstanding and 44,121,225 shares were held as treasury shares.
At the same date, approximately 21.2 million ADSs equivalent to 212 million ordinary shares, or approximately 2.5% of the total number of ordinary shares outstanding on that date were outstanding and were held by 2,461 record holders of ADRs.
At 31 March 2004, there were 3,577 shareholders with a US address on the register of shareholders.
Dividends Since shortly after its incorporation in 1984, British Telecommunications plc paid interim dividends annually in February and final dividends in September.
However, as part of BTs debt reduction and restructuring plans, neither a final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2001 nor an interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2002 was paid to shareholders.
A final dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2003, was paid on 8 September 2003 to shareholders on the register on 8 August 2003, and an interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2004 was paid on 9 February 2004 to shareholders on the register on 30 December 2003.
The dividends paid or payable on BT shares and ADSs for the last five years are shown in the following table.
The dividends on the ordinary shares exclude the associated tax credit.
The amounts shown are not those that were actually paid to holders of ADSs.
For the tax treatment of dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 see Taxation of dividends below.
The dividends on the ADSs paid before 5 April 1999 include the associated UK tax credit available to certain beneficial owners who are resident in the United States or Canada for tax purposes, but before deduction of UK withholding taxes.
Dividends have been translated from pounds sterling into US dollars using exchange rates prevailing on the date the ordinary dividends were paid.
The US dollar amount of the final dividend of 53 pence per ADS to be paid to holders of ADSs will be based on the exchange rate in effect on 6 September 2004, the date of payment to holders of ordinary shares.
As dividends paid by the company are in pounds sterling, exchange rate uctuations will affect the US dollar amounts received by holders of ADSs on conversion by the Depositary of such cash dividends.
Dividend mandate Any shareholder wishing dividends to be paid directly into a bank or building society account should contact the Shareholder Helpline see page 153.
Dividends paid in this way will be paid through the Bankers Automated Clearing System BACS.
Alternatively, a form may be downloaded from the internet at www.

145 Additional information for shareholders BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Total Shareholder Return Total shareholder return TSR is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its shareholders, reecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.
It is, therefore, a good indicator of a companys overall performance.
Over the past five years as shown in the TSR chart below, BT after performing very strongly in the first year, has suffered falls in its share price like many stocks in the telecoms, media and technology TMT sector.
BTs TSR as adjusted for the rights issue and demerger over the last five years was negative 72% compared to a FTSE 100 TSR fall of negative 20%.
However, over the past year both BT and the FTSE 100 have delivered a very positive performance BT positive 18% and the FTSE 100 positive 26%.
In the period between the demerger on 19 November 2001 and 31 March 2004, BTs share price outperformed the European Telecoms sector for most of the period.
However, BT shares have not matched the sector recovery in the most recent months resulting in an underperformance versus the European Telecom sector by around 8% as shown in the share price performance chart, over the 28 month period.

Taxation US Holders This is a summary only of the principal US federal income tax and UK tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs by US Holders as dened below who hold their ordinary shares or ADSs as capital assets.
It does not address all aspects of US federal income taxation and does not address aspects that may be relevant to persons who are subject to special provisions of US federal income tax law, including US expatriates, insurance companies, tax-exempt organisations, financial institutions, securities broker-dealers, traders in securities who elect a mark-to-market method of accounting, persons subject to alternative minimum tax, investors that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10% or more of the outstanding share capital or voting power of BT, persons holding their ordinary shares or ADSs as part of a straddle, hedging transaction or conversion transaction, persons who acquired their ordinary shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or otherwise as compensation, or persons whose functional currency is not the US dollar, amongst others.
Those holders may be subject to US federal income tax consequences different from those set forth below.
For purposes of this summary, a US Holder is a beneficial owner of ordinary shares or ADSs that, for US federal income tax purposes, is: an individual citizen or resident of the United States, a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for US federal income tax purposes created or organised in or under the laws of the United States or any state thereof, an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income taxation regardless of its source, or a trust if a US court can exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more US persons are authorised to control all substantial decisions of the trust.
If a partnership holds ordinary shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
A partner in a partnership that holds ordinary shares or ADSs is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the specic tax consequences of owning and disposing of the ordinary shares or ADSs.
In particular, this summary is based on i current UK tax law and UK Inland Revenue practice and US law and US Internal Revenue Service IRS practice, including the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, Treasury regulations, rulings, judicial decisions and administrative practice, all as currently in effect, ii the United KingdomUnited States Income Tax Convention that entered into force on 25 April 1980 as in effect on 1 January 2003 the 1980 Convention, iii the United KingdomUnited States Convention relating to estate and gift taxes, and iv the new United KingdomUnited States Tax Convention that entered into force on 150 Additional information for shareholders BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 31 March 2003 the New Convention, all as in effect on the date of this Annual Report, all of which are subject to change or changes in interpretation, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders should be aware that the New Convention generally will have effect in respect of dividends paid on or after 1 May 2003.
However, a US Holder entitled to benets under the 1980 Convention may elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue for an additional twelve months if the election to apply the 1980 Convention would result in greater benets to the Holder.
If a US Holder were to make an effective election, the discussion below with respect to dividend payments made pursuant to the 1980 Convention would continue to apply to dividends paid by BT prior to 1 May 2004.
The discussion below notes instances where the relevant provisions of the New Convention will produce a materially different result for a US Holder.
US Holders should note that certain articles in the New Convention limit or restrict the ability of a US Holder to claim benets under the New Convention and that similar provisions were not contained in the 1980 Convention.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors as to the applicability of the Conventions and the consequences under UK, US federal, state and local, and other laws, of the ownership and disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs.
Taxation of dividends The UK currently does not apply a withholding tax on dividends under its internal tax laws.
For US federal income tax purposes, a distribution including any additional dividend income arising from a foreign tax credit claim as described below will be treated as ordinary dividend income to the extent paid out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for US tax purposes, based on the US dollar value of the distribution calculated by reference to the spot rate in effect on the date the distribution is actually or constructively received by a US Holder of ordinary shares, or by the Depositary, in the case of ADSs.
Distributions by BT in excess of its current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the US Holders adjusted tax basis in the ordinary shares or ADSs, and thereafter taxable as capital gain.
Dividends paid by BT will not be eligible for the US dividends received deduction.
For dividends paid on or before 5 April 1999, US Holders were generally entitled to receive the cash dividend plus a Treaty payment from the Inland Revenue of one quarter of the dividend, subject to a UK withholding tax of 15% of the aggregate amount paid.
As an example for illustration purposes only, a US Holder who was entitled to a dividend of 80 was also entitled to a Treaty payment of 20, reduced by the withholding tax of 15% on the gross amount of 100, i. e. 15, leaving a net cash payment of 85.
The full dividend plus the full Treaty payment including the UK tax withheld was taxable income for US purposes, and the UK tax withheld generally was available as a US credit or deduction.
For dividends paid on or after 6 April 1999 and subject to the 1980 Convention as described above, the Treaty payment reduces to one ninth of the dividend i. e. one tenth of the gross payment.
As a result of the UK withholding tax which cannot exceed the amount of the hypothetical Treaty payment, US Holders will no longer receive any Treaty payment.
In the above example, the cash dividend would be 80, and the hypothetical Treaty payment would be 8.89 one ninth of 80.
However, since the UK withholding tax 15% of 88.89, would exceed the amount of the hypothetical Treaty payment, no Treaty payment will be made and the US Holder will receive only the cash dividend here, 80.
A US Holder will be taxable in the US on the full dividend and full hypothetical Treaty payment 88.89, and will be treated as having paid a foreign tax equal to the hypothetical Treaty payment here, 8.89.
The effect on each US Holder will depend on circumstances that are particular to that Holder.
The foreign tax deemed paid generally will be available as a US credit or deduction.
A US Holder could elect to receive a foreign tax credit or deduction with respect to any UK withholding tax on IRS Form 8833 TreatyBased Return Position Disclosure Under Section 6114 or 7701 b.
For purposes of calculating the foreign tax credit, dividends paid on the ordinary shares or ADSs will be treated as income from sources outside the United States and generally will constitute passive income or, for certain Holders, financial services income.
The rules relating to the determination of the foreign tax credit are very complex.
US Holders who do not elect to claim a credit with respect to any foreign taxes paid in a given taxable year may instead claim a deduction for foreign taxes paid.
A deduction does not reduce US federal income tax on a dollar for dollar basis like a tax credit.
The deduction, however, is not subject to the limitations applicable to foreign credits.
There will be no hypothetical Treaty payment and no notional UK withholding tax applied to a dividend payment made under the New Convention.
Therefore, it will not be possible for US Holders to claim a foreign tax credit in respect of any dividend payment made by BT on or after 1 May 2003 or 1 May 2004 in the case of a US Holder who effectively elects to extend the applicability of the 1980 Convention as described above.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether the US Holder is eligible for benets under the 1980 Convention and the New Convention, whether, and to what extent, a foreign tax credit will be available with respect to dividends received from BT, whether it may be advisable in light of the Holders particular circumstances to elect to have the provisions of the 1980 Convention continue in force until 1 May 2004, and the treatment of any foreign currency gain or loss on any pounds sterling received with respect to ordinary shares that are not converted into US dollars on the date the pounds sterling are actually or constructively received.
151 Additional information for shareholders BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 Recent US tax law changes applicable to individuals Under 2003 US tax legislation, some US Holders including individuals are eligible for reduced rates of US federal income tax currently a maximum of 15% in respect of qualied dividend income received in taxable years beginning after 31 December 2002 and beginning before 1 January 2009.
For this purpose, qualied dividend income generally includes dividends paid by non-US corporations if, among other things, certain minimum holding periods are met and either i the shares or ADSs with respect to which the dividend has been paid are readily tradeable on an established securities market in the United States, or ii the non-US corporation is eligible for the benets of a comprehensive US income tax treaty such as both Conventions which provides for the exchange of information.
BT currently believes that dividends paid with respect to its ordinary shares and ADSs will constitute qualied dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided the individual US Holders of its ordinary shares and ADSs meet certain requirements.
Some of the eligibility requirements for nonUS corporations are not entirely certain, however, and further guidance from the IRS is anticipated.
In addition, the IRS is expected to issue certication procedures in 2004 whereby a non-US corporation will be required to certify as to the eligibility of its dividends for the reduced US federal income tax rates.
Taxation of capital gains Unless a US resident carries on a trade through a branch or agency in the UK, and the disposal of ordinary shares and or ADSs is related to the activities of that trade, UK capital gains tax is not charged on US residents who dispose of ordinary shares and or ADSs.
For US federal income tax purposes, a US Holder generally will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between the US dollar value of the amount realised on the disposition and the US Holders adjusted tax basis determined in US dollars in the ordinary shares or ADSs.
Such gain or loss generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if the ordinary shares have been held for more than one year at the time of disposition.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.
Capital gains recognised by an individual US Holder generally are subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates if specified holdings periods are met.
Passive foreign investment company status A non-US corporation will be classied as a Passive Foreign Investment Company a PFIC for any taxable year if at least 75% of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50% of the average value of its assets consist of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
BT currently believes that it did not qualify as a PFIC for the taxable year ending 31 March 2004 for US federal income tax purposes.
If BT were to become a PFIC for any taxable year, US Holders would suffer adverse tax consequences.
These consequences may include having gains realised on the disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs treated as ordinary income rather than capital gains and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the ordinary shares or ADSs.
Furthermore, dividends paid by BT would not be qualied dividend income and would be subject to the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary income.
US Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to BT.
US information reporting and backup withholding Dividends paid on and proceeds received from the sale or disposition of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to information reporting to the IRS and backup withholding at a current rate of 28%.
Certain exempt recipients such as corporations are not subject to these information reporting requirements.
Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a Holder who provides a correct taxpayer identication number or certicate of foreign status and makes any other required certication or who is otherwise exempt.
US persons who are required to establish their exempt status generally must furnish IRS Form W-9 Request for Taxpayer Identication Number and Certication.
Non-US Holders generally will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding.
However, such Holders may be required to provide certication of non-US status in connection with payments received in the United States or through certain US-related financial intermediaries.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a Holders US federal income tax liability.
A Holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by timely ling the appropriate claim for refund with the IRS and furnishing any required information.
UK stamp duty A transfer of an ordinary share will generally be subject to UK stamp duty or UK stamp duty reserve tax at 0.5% of the amount or value of any consideration provided.
A transfer of an ordinary share into a clearance service or American depository system gives rise to a 1.5% charge of either the amount of the consideration provided or the value of the share issued.
No UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of an ADS assuming it is not registered in the UK, provided that the transfer documents are executed and always retained outside the UK.
152 Additional information for shareholders BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 UK inheritance and gift taxes in connection with ordinary shares and or ADSs Where an individual holder, who is not a UK national, of ordinary shares and or ADSs falls within the scope of the UK US Estate and Gift Tax Convention, US-domiciled holders of ordinary shares and or ADSs will not generally be subject to UK inheritance tax on a gift of ordinary shares and or ADSs if the gift is subject to US federal gift tax.
Similarly, ordinary shares and or ADSs passing on the death of a US-domiciled shareholder, who is not a UK national, will not generally be subject to UK inheritance tax if the estate is subject to US estate tax.
The rules and scope of domicile are complex and action should not be taken without advice specic to the individuals circumstances.
