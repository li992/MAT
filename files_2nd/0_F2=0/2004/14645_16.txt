Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 33 Notes to the accounts 1.
Accounting policies Basis of accounting The Accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The Company is not required to present a separate profit and loss account as provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Results of subsidiaries acquired in the year are consolidated from the date of acquisition.
The consolidated accounts include the Groups share of profits of its joint ventures and associates.
Associates are entities in which the Group has a continuing participating interest, other than subsidiaries, and exercises significant inuence over their operating and financial policies.
Results are based on management accounts to 31 December.
The investment in associates is accounted for using the equity method.
Entities in which the Group holds an interest on a long term basis and which are jointly controlled by the Group and other parties are treated as joint ventures.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
All intra group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of transaction.
The results of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are translated into sterling using average rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
profits and losses arising from the re-translation of opening net assets of overseas subsidiaries, treating long term intra group loans as part of the equity investment, and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, are dealt with through reserves.
All other exchange profits and losses are taken to the profit and loss account, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against Group equity investments in overseas subsidiaries, which are taken directly to reserves together with the exchange differences on the carrying amount of the related investments.
Financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to uctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Financial instruments will be accounted for as hedges when designated as hedges at the inception of the contract.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The rates under these contracts are used to record the hedged item, and as such gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are offset against the foreign exchange gains and losses on the related financial assets and liabilities.
Where the contract is a hedge against future transactions, gains and losses are deferred until the transaction occurs.
Interest rate swaps are occasionally used to hedge the Groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the underlying financial instrument.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value or shown in the Group balance sheet at the year end but are disclosed in the fair value table in note 29.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to the termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed in note 29.
Liquid resources include short term deposits, government securities and similar securities, which are readily convertible into known amounts of cash.
Short term debtors and creditors that meet the denition of a financial asset or liability, respectively, have been excluded from all analyses prepared under Financial Reporting Standard FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosures, including numerical disclosures except for the analysis of net currency exposure, as permitted by the Standard.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that the economic benets will ow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectibility is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specic contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
34 Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulls its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has obtained the right to consideration.
The Group does not enter into a significant number of long term contracts.
Revenue and estimated profits on long term contracts are recognised under the  method of accounting.
When estimates of total contract revenues and costs indicate a loss, a provision for the entire amount of the contract loss is recognised in the period in which the loss becomes evident.
The Group does not enter into bill and hold transactions.
Product development Expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
Employee benets When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benets expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share based compensation The Group operates a stock appreciation rights plan which gives rise to a profit and loss charge in respect of the intrinsic value of the award.
This expense is charged over the vesting period.
Other share based awards do not currently attract a profit and loss charge, as, other than the SAYE schemes discussed below, shares are not granted at a discount to the market price at the date of the invitation.
The Group operates Inland Revenue approved SAYE schemes together with equivalent schemes for overseas employees that allow the grant of options at a discount to the market price at the date of the invitation.
The Group and the Company have made use of the exemption under Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes not to recognise any compensation charge in respect of these schemes.
These schemes are discussed in more detail in note 31.
Pension contributions In the UK the Group operates two pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
These schemes require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
Other schemes are dened contribution in nature.
The assets of the dened benefit schemes are measured at their market value at the balance sheet date and the liabilities of the schemes are measured using the projected unit method.
The discount rate used to measure the schemes liabilities is the current rate of return on an AA corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liabilities.
The extent to which the schemes assets exceed or fall short of the schemes liabilities is shown as a surplus or deficit in the balance sheet net of deferred tax.
The regular service cost of providing retirement benets to employees in dened benefit schemes is charged to operating profit in the year together with the cost of providing benefit improvements in respect of past service and gains or losses arising on settlements and curtailments.
A credit for the expected return on the schemes assets and a charge for the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities because the benets are one year closer to settlement, are included in other finance expense in the profit and loss account.
Differences arising between the actual and expected returns on the schemes assets together with changes in the actuarial assumptions are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions payable to the other overseas dened contribution plans are charged to the profit and loss account in the year for which they are due.
Government grants Government grants towards research and development costs are recognised as income over periods which match them with the related costs and are deducted in reporting the related expense.
Capital grants are treated as deferred income and are released to the profit and loss account over the estimated useful lives of the assets to which they relate.
Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable represents the amount expected to be paid or recovered in respect of taxable profit for the year and is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is provided on an undiscounted basis on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date except as referred to below.
Amounts provided are calculated with reference to tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 35 Provision is made for tax that would arise on the remittance of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, the dividends have been accrued as receivable.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on gains on fair value adjustments to xed assets arising at acquisition, or gains on the disposal of xed assets that have been rolled over into replacement assets, unless there is a binding agreement to dispose of the assets concerned.
Provision will not be made where it is considered more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over into replacement assets and charged to tax only when the replacement assets are sold.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and representing the excess of cost over the fair value of the attributable assets and liabilities acquired is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its estimated useful economic life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising prior to 1998 and previously written off against reserves, has not been reinstated but, in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, would be charged to the profit and loss account on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it related.
Where impairment has been identied in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, goodwill arising prior to 1998 has also been reviewed for impairment.
Other intangible assets Other separately identiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees and trademarks, are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off all other assets over their estimated useful lives at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Leasehold properties 50 years or lease period if less Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, ttings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of tangible xed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised in the balance sheet at net present value.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over their estimated useful life.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
Stocks Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity.
Net realisable value represents the selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.

The above plans are funded and have full UK Inland Revenue tax-exempt approval by which benets are limited due to the statutory earnings cap an Inland Revenue limit on the amount of earnings that can be made pensionable under the plans for members who joined after May 1989.
Certain members, whose salaries are in excess of this cap, have had their benets increased through unapproved unfunded arrangements to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of the basic salary only.
The Company has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benets itself and a provision at 31 December 2004 of 0.8 million 2003 4.8 million is included in the net pension liability above.
This represents the actuarial value, as confirmed by the Companys pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a Market Value basis in line with the Main Plan Valuation and adjusted each year by the charge for the year equivalent to a contribution to a funded plan of 0.1 million 2003 0.2 million and interest on the unfunded liability of nil 2003 0.3 million.
The additional death-in-service benets over the statutory cap are separately insured by the Company under an unapproved scheme.
Dened contribution schemes United Kingdom The Group maintains dened contribution pension schemes for employees in the UK.
These plans are known as Cash Builder or Pension Builder and employer contributions into these schemes for 2004 were 0.1 million 2003 0.1 million.
United States The Group maintains dened contribution pension benefit plans for employees of its US subsidiaries.
These plans, known as 401 k plans, allow employees to defer a percentage of their salary for retirement.
There are four different 401 k plans within the US businesses and each of these plans has different features regarding Company contributions, maximum deferral percentages and investment choices.
The investment choices offered are among a selection of diversied mutual funds offering a broad mix of investment return potential with varying levels of risk.
In aggregate the Company contributions to the various US plans totalled $4.6 million for 2004 2003 $4.4 million.
Total assets in the dened contribution plans at the end of 2004 were $116.8 million 2003 $103.1 million.
There were no dened benefit plans in the US at 31 December 2004.
Other jurisdictions Outside the UK and the US employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations and these arrangements are dened contribution schemes.
Total contributions for 2004 in respect of these schemes amounted to 0.3 million 2003 0.2 million.
Total contributions to dened contribution schemes were 2.9 million 2003 3.0 million.

Taxation Analysis of charge for the period 2004 2003 million million Current tax Overseas taxation 7.4 4.9 Under over provision in prior years UK tax 1.1 Overseas taxation 1.3 7.1 6.1 1.1 Share of joint ventures taxation 1.1 Share of associates taxation 1.0 0.9 Total current tax charge 7.1 0.9 Deferred tax Origination and reversal of timing differences 1.7 0.3 Origination of deferred tax assets 1.1 Total deferred tax charge credit 0.6 0.3 Total tax charge for the year 7.7 0.6 There was no tax effect in respect of operating exceptional items 2003 1.7 million credit nor was there any effect in respect of the non-operating exceptional items 2003 nil.
In 2003 a credit of 12.6 million arose in the statement of total recognised gains and losses as a deferred tax asset was recognised on the pension fund liability.
A charge of 0.9 million 2003 0.1 million arises on the actuarial gain and this has been included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Factors affecting tax charge for the period The current tax charge for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30 per cent.
The differences are explained as follows: 2004 2003 million million profit before tax 24.0 0.3 profit before tax multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30 per cent 2003 30 per cent 7.2 0.1 Expenses not deductible for tax primarily goodwill amortisation 3.8 7.3 Movement in timing differences 0.6 0.3 Different tax rates on overseas earnings and other adjustments 2.0 0.8 Tax overprovided in previous years 1.3 6.0 Total current tax charge 7.1 0.9 Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 45 Factors that may affect future tax charges Deferred tax assets of 13.3 million 2003 18.3 million arising principally on timing differences in the US and UK have not been recognised.
These assets can only be realised when they reverse against suitable taxable profits.
Although the directors ultimately expect to realise these assets, there is currently insufficient evidence under FRS 19 Deferred Tax to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these timing differences.
In addition, the Group has tax losses arising in the US of 70.6 million 2003 70.1 million and in the UK of 39.6 million 2003 24.8 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these losses as their future recovery is uncertain.
In total, deferred tax assets amounting to 52.6 million 2003 50.3 million have not been recognised on unutilised losses and timing differences.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates and the joint venture.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the tax deduction which may be available on the future exercise of stock options.
Earnings loss per share Earnings loss per share is calculated by reference to the profit loss for the year and the number of Ordinary shares in issue during the year as follows: 2004 2003 million million Basic earnings loss attributable to shareholders 16.0 0.5 Operating exceptional items 2.9 7.5 Goodwill amortisation 9.1 9.7 Loss profit on the disposal of operations 0.9 3.6 Exceptional interest charge 0.5 16.1 Prior year tax credit 1.3 6.0 Attributable taxation on exceptional items 1.7 Headline earnings attributable to shareholders 28.1 21.5 Number Number million million Weighted average number of shares in issue basic and headline 939.2 929.3 Dilutive potential of employee share options 18.1 Weighted average number of shares in issue diluted 957.3 929.3 The shares in issue used to calculate basic and headline earnings loss per share exclude the shares held by the Spirent Sharesave Trust SST formerly Spirent Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust and the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT in accordance with FRS 14 Earnings per Share.

An interest rate derivative was entered into in 1999 to reduce the effective interest rate to 9.53 per cent.
Loan notes are repayable: i at maturity: or ii at any time at the Companys option in an amount of not less than 5 per cent of the aggregate principal amount then outstanding plus a make-whole amount.
If Spirent plc repaid at its option the total principal amount of the loan notes at 31 December 2004 then a make-whole amount of $22.1 million 11.5 million would become payable.
Financial risk management The key objective of the Group Treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
The major risks managed by Treasury, under the approved policies, are liquidity and renancing risk, interest rate and currency risk and counterparty credit risk.
Financial instruments including derivatives are used to manage these exposures when deemed appropriate.
Financing The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are nanced through a combination of retained earnings and external nancing.
Financing is raised principally by the parent company and lent to subsidiaries on commercial terms.
Debt is largely sourced from the syndicated bank market and the US private placement market.
At 31 December 2004, the amount of senior unsecured loan notes was $124.8 million, equivalent to 65.0 million at 31 December 2004 exchange rates.
These notes have maturity dates of 2006 and 2009.
Committed bank facilities amounted to 30 million at 31 December 2004 on which there were no amounts drawn.
These facilities matured on 2 February 2005 but were replaced with a new 364-day bank facility of 30 million.
This new facility has a 12 month term-out option.
Interest rate management The objective of our interest rate management policy is to reduce the volatility of the interest charge.
Interest rate exposure is managed through an optimum mix of xed and oating rate debt and the use of interest rate swaps.
At 31 December 2004 the Groups borrowings were composed of 51 per cent of xed rate debt.
This excludes $72.1 million of senior unsecured loan notes which have been swapped into oating rates through the use of interest rate swaps which terminate on 23 November 2009.
These swaps are callable at the counterparties option at six monthly intervals.
Our interest charge excluding exceptional interest expense was 6.8 million 2003 9.3 million.
A one percentage point movement in short term US dollar interest rates based on the year end position would impact profit before taxation by approximately 0.3 million.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 55 Currency management Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by subsidiaries in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of our overseas subsidiaries.
Group Treasury, by means of forward foreign exchange contracts, carries out the majority of the transaction hedging activity.
We do not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposures of the operating results or net assets of our overseas subsidiaries since these are accounting and not cash exposures.
However, to provide a partial hedge we match, as far as possible, the currency of our borrowings with the currency prole of our operating results and net assets.
At 31 December 2004 the balance sheet translation exposure was 61 per cent hedged 2003 61 per cent.
During the year sterling strengthened against the US dollar the main currency to which we are exposed.
Interest rate risk The interest rate prole of the Groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December after taking into account interest rate swaps was as follows: 2004 million At oating Non-interest interest rates bearing Total Financial assets Sterling 29.1 0.2 29.3 US dollar 9.1 1.8 10.9 Euro 5.8 0.4 6.2 Others 4.3 1.2 5.5 48.3 3.6 51.9 2003 million At oating Non-interest interest rates bearing Total Financial assets Sterling 8.5 0.4 8.9 US dollar 17.2 1.1 18.3 Euro 4.0 0.6 4.6 Others 4.3 1.7 6.0 34.0 3.8 37.8 The financial assets of the Group comprise: 2004 2003 million million Debtors due after more than one year excluding prepayments note 20 0.2 0.2 Cash at bank and in hand note 22 51.7 37.6 51.9 37.8 Floating rate financial assets comprised cash deposits at call, seven day and monthly rates.

4 On 24 November 2004 Spirent plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation which stood at that date at 702.7 million and 0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the accounts of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in distributable reserves.
The balance of this reserve created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated was transferred to a special non-distributable reserve.
The special non-distributable reserve, which at 31 December 2004 stood at 61.6 million, will be increased in future years to the extent that the Company subsequently realises any value from its assets in excess of the value at which those assets were recorded in the Companys accounts at the time of the Cancellation.
The special non-distributable reserve will have a maximum value equal to the aggregate of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve at the time of the Cancellation, being 703.4 million.
The special non-distributable reserve will be used to eliminate deficits arising in future years and is only capable of being distributed to the shareholders of the Company once all the creditors of the Company which existed at the date of the Cancellation have consented to the cancellation or been satisfied in full.
5The investment in own shares relates to 3.5 million Ordinary shares 2003 3.5 million held by the Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited SST and 9.5 million Ordinary shares 2003 9.5 million held by the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
Shares held by the SST will be used to satisfy options under the Companys Savings Related Share Option Schemes.
Shares in the ESOT are primarily held to hedge awards under various discretionary employee share schemes.
The cost of investment in own shares has been deducted from the profit and loss reserve at 31 December 2004.
The market value of own shares held in trust at 31 December 2004 was 9.6 million 2003 7.6 million.

At 24 February 2005, no purchases have been made or are contracted to be made under such authority.
In accordance with the rules of the following share schemes, options and purchase rights were exercised during the year which resulted in new Ordinary shares being allotted by the Company as follows: Number of Consideration Ordinary shares received million 000 Executive Schemes 0.1 18.9 Spirent Stock Incentive Plan 2.6 605.3 Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan 1.5 339.5 1 Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan 0.3 27.4 All Employee Share Schemes 3.4 521.9 Total 7.9 1,513.0 Note 1The exercise consideration for options under this plan is paid in US dollars and has been converted into sterling in the above table at an exchange rate of 1 $1.83, being the average exchange rate for 2004.
62 Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 31.
Capital and reserves continued During the year, no shares were transferred from Spirent Sharesave Trust Limited.
On 4 January 2005, 2.7 million Ordinary shares were allotted following the automatic exercise of purchase rights under the Companys US Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan.
Between 1 January 2005 and 24 February 2005 approximately 1.2 million Ordinary shares were allotted following exercises under other employee share schemes.
With the exception of the foregoing, there has been no material increase in the issued share capital, whether by exercise of options, purchase rights or otherwise, between the year end and 24 February 2005, the date on which these Accounts have been signed.
Employee share schemes At 31 December 2004 the following options and purchase rights over Ordinary shares have been granted and remained outstanding under the Companys various employee share schemes.
Figures for the options or purchase rights outstanding and the exercise price per Ordinary share have each been adjusted, where relevant, for the 3:1 subdivision of share capital in 2000 and for the rights issue effected in 2000.

These shares were originally purchased in the market to cover awards made under the Companys now closed Long Term Share Purchase Plan and the Stock Appreciation Rights Plan but the awards relating to the shares lapsed before exercise.
Although 6.1 million Ordinary shares are included above in the number of options outstanding, market-purchased shares held for the purpose of satisfying SSIP awards do not count towards the Companys overall dilution calculations.
2Exercise prices per share for options under the Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan are denominated in US dollars and are expressed as US cents in the above table.
3The Company has taken advantage of the exemption within UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes in accounting for all employee share schemes.
4The exercise price and number of shares subject to the purchase rights outstanding cannot ultimately be determined until the maturity of each respective offering period ie normally 12 months following the date of grant.
The exercise price and number of purchase rights outstanding as shown above are based on the market price of an Ordinary share less the applicable 15 per cent discount at the date of grant.
5At 31 December 2003 there were 108.5 million options purchase rights outstanding.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 63 a 1985 and 1995 Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS The Inland Revenue approved 1995 ESOS incorporates the guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI at that time.
It was subsequently amended by the Board to facilitate the award of unapproved share options both in the UK and overseas.
There are currently 328 participating executives in the ESOS.
Awards under the 1995 ESOS, normally determined annually, are at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive.
No price is payable on the grant of an option and no options have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the 1995 ESOS are subject to the achievement of an earnings per share EPS performance condition before they can be exercised.
The condition is that over a period of three consecutive financial years, there has been an increase in the Companys headline EPS which is at least 6 per cent more than the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
All ESOS grants made after 11 May 2000 to the executive directors and certain senior managers are subject to enhanced performance conditions on exercise.
These are more fully explained in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 19 to 26.
The Remuneration Committee may in future impose different performance targets which they consider to be no less demanding.
Options granted under the 1985 ESOS are exercisable unconditionally.
b International Executive Share Option Scheme IESOS Certain US executives have previously been granted unapproved options under the IESOS with participation and awards being at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.
Options are exercisable unconditionally and normally between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Again, no options have been granted at a discount to the market price.
The IESOS is closed and has been replaced by the unapproved arrangements to the 1995 ESOS referred to in a above.
c Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP formerly the Spirent Stock Option Plan was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at selected employees in the Communications group with grants normally determined annually by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
Following an Extraordinary General Meeting held in June 2004, shareholders approved the renewal of the SSIP until the Companys 2007 AGM along with several amendments including the ability to award stock appreciation rights SARs as well as stock options.
SARs will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary share over the SAR price in the form of new issue Ordinary shares.
The SARs approach will help the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value will need to be funded.
Using a SARs-based approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
20.1 million SARs, with exercise prices of between 56 pence and 71 pence were outstanding at 31 December 2004, however, no SARs were exercised in 2004.
Awards made pursuant to the SSIP normally vest over four years, provided that the employee remains in employment.
Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
SSIP awards granted from June 2004 to certain senior managers will only become exercisable subject to the achievement of certain performance conditions which are broadly the annual equivalent of the enhanced conditions for the ESOS, described above.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
d Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares, primarily held by Netcom employees, into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the NARSOP.
All remaining outstanding options are fully vested and exercisable until they expire.
64 Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 31.
Capital and reserves continued e Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in 2000, approximately 3.8 million shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the ZARSOP.
These options are primarily held by Zarak employees and have either a five or 10 year life from the original date of grant.
Unvested rolled-over options were capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event were held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder was entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they were held in trust but they remained subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment was terminated prior to the vesting date.
All ZARSOP options and resulting shares held in the ESOT have now fully vested.
f Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares will vest over a period expiring in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed under the CARSP.
The options are held by Caw employees and have a 10 year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
Any Ordinary shares issued under the CARSP are restricted until they have vested or are not at risk from forfeiture under the plan rules.
Unvested rolled-over options are capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event are held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder is entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they are held in the ESOT but they remain subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment is terminated prior to the vesting date.
In accordance with the original terms for acquiring Caw, in March 2004, Spirent allotted 4.3 million Ordinary shares and issued 75,000 options following the achievement by Caw of certain technical and financial earn out targets.
Participation in the CARSP entitled the participants to a share in the earn out.
Any earn out payment for an outstanding CARSP option was made by increasing the number of shares subject to the option and decreasing the per share exercise price so as to preserve the existing aggregate total exercise price.
Of the 4.3 million shares, 54,000 shares were issued to the ESOT in respect of unvested restricted shares, which remained subject to forfeiture prior to vesting.
As a result of the earn out, the additional cash payment referred to above was adjusted to 66.9 US cents as each share vests or upon the exercise of a vested option.
In accordance with the rules of the ESOS noted in a above, the Ordinary shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak, and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count toward ABI scheme limits.
The plans mentioned in d to f above are closed to new entrants and no further awards of options can be made under them.
g UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS The SRSOS is an Inland Revenue approved scheme and is open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a xed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market price of an Ordinary share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company has established an employee share ownership trust to honour the contractual commitment to deliver Ordinary shares against the valid exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS and the SST, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent plc, acts as sole trustee.
During the year no shares were transferred to participants.
SST has waived all rights to receive dividends payable on its registered shareholding except for 0.01 pence per annum in aggregate and accordingly such shareholding is not included in the Companys EPS calculation as referred to in note 12.
Spirent plc Annual Report 2004 65 h US Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP The ESPP operates on a broadly similar basis to the SRSOS.
It enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares using proceeds of a savings contract.
When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of $1,000 net per month, over a contract period of 12 months by way of regular payroll deductions.
No price is payable on the grant of a purchase right.
The purchase price will be based on the market value of an Ordinary share either on the first day of the offering period or on the last day of the offering period, whichever price is lower, less a 15 per cent discount or, where shares are to be subscribed, their nominal value if greater.
i Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to share in the Companys performance through share ownership.
The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 net per month.
j Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure of the NARSOP described in d above and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group.
Under the SARP, recruitment, promotion and recognition awards over Ordinary shares have been made in line with historic and local competitive market practice on a quarterly basis at the discretion of a committee of senior executives.
The operation of the SARP reects as far as practicable the now closed NARSOP.
Accordingly, rights under the SARP vest over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Rights granted are not subject to the fullment of any pre-exercise performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary share over the rights price in the form of existing Ordinary shares which have been purchased in the market by the Companys ESOT.
The maximum number of shares over which SARP awards can be made is 5.25 million.
At 31 December 2004, the following rights were outstanding under the SARP: Number of rights Rights price outstanding Rights exercise dates pence million 10.09.00-29.06.10 182-416 2.6 Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT At 31 December 2004 the ESOT held 10.3 million Ordinary shares 2003 11.2 million Ordinary shares to satisfy awards under various share based incentive schemes as described above.
Of this number, 0.6 million Ordinary shares were unconditionally vested at 31 December 2004 2003 1.3 million Ordinary shares.
