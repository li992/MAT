BASIS OF PREPARATION The supplementary information on pages 86 to 92 shows the Groups life results as measured on an achieved profit basis, which includes the results of the Groups long-term assurance business on a basis determined in accordance with the ABI Guidance Supplementary Reporting for long term assurance business the achieved profits method issued in December 2001.
All other transactions and balances have been determined in accordance with the MSSB accounting policies noted on pages 59 to 62.
The objective of the Achieved Profit basis is to provide shareholders with more realistic information on the financial position and performance of the Group than that provided by the modified statutory solvency basis.
The Groups unit trust business is not included on an achieved profit basis within this supplementary information although it is in the unaudited financial information.
METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS The Achieved Profits methodology recognises as profit the discounted value of the expected future statutory surpluses arising from the contracts in force at the period end the value of long-term business in force.
These future surpluses are calculated by projecting future cash flows using realistic assumptions for each component of the cash flow.
Actuarial assumptions for the mortality, morbidity and persistency experience of the contracts, expenses and taxation expected to be incurred are based on recent experience and are reviewed annually.
The future economic and investment conditions are based on the period end conditions and are likely to change from year to year.
Economic Assumptions The principal economic assumptions used within the cash flows at 31 December 2004 are set out below alongside the comparatives for 31 December 2003.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 Risk discount rate net of tax 8.00% 8.25% Future investment returns: - Fixed Interest 4.50% 4.75% - Equities 7.00% 7.25% - Unit-linked funds: - Capital growth 3.70% 3.75% - Dividend income 2.80% 3.00% - T otal 6.50% 6.75% Expense inflation 4.25% 4.25% Indexation of capital gains 1.80% 1.75% The risk discount rate is used to discount the projected future cash flows from the business in-force to a present value.
The rate is set by reference to the assumed future investment returns.
89 NOTES TO THE ACHIEVED PROFIT RESULT continued II.
METHODOLOGY AND ASSUMPTIONS CONTINUED The assumed future pre-tax returns on fixed interest securities are set by reference to the 15 year gilt yield index.
The other investment returns are set by reference to this assumption.
The expense inflation and indexation of capital gains assumptions are based on the rate of inflation implicit in the current valuation of 15 year index-linked gilts 2.75% at 31 December 2004.
The expense inflation assumption is increased by a 1.5% loading to reflect increases in earnings and the indexation of capital gains is reduced by 0.5%.
Experience Assumptions The principal experience assumptions were derived as follows.
All experience assumptions are reviewed regularly.
The persistency experience is derived where possible from the Companys own experience, or otherwise from external industry experience.
Maintenance expenses have been set in line with the costs charged by the Companys third party administrators, together with an allowance for the Companys own maintenance costs.
Mortality and morbidity assumptions have been set by reference to the Companys own experience, published industry data and the rates charged by the Companys reassurers.
There is a provision of 6.9 million before tax 31 December 2003: 12.5 million within the cash flows to provide for adverse morbidity and persistency experience on critical illness plans.
Other items The value of new business has been established at the end of the reporting period.
It has been calculated using actual acquisition costs.
In projecting future surpluses allowance has been made for the cost of maintaining a statutory solvency margin on the business in force.
Recurring single premiums are treated as if they were individual single premiums.
Future taxation has been determined assuming a continuation of the current tax legislation.
The achieved profits results are calculated on an after-tax basis and are grossed up to the pre-tax level for presentation in the profit and loss account.
The rate of tax used was 30% except for the Irish life business, which was grossed up at 12.5%.
These are unchanged from 31 December 2003.
Following the recent Advocate Generals opinion on a case relating to the repositioning of the VAT exemption for insurance related services see Financial Commentary for further details, a long-term business reserve of 4.0 million pre-tax has been established against any adverse outcome 31 December 2003: nil.

COMPONENTS OF LIFE ACHIEVED PROFIT The pre-tax components of the Achieved Profit result for life are shown below.
The basic operating Achieved Profit is determined using the assumptions as set out above in note II.
This value is subsequently adjusted to take into account items considered to be short-term variations to these longer-term assumptions to show the total achieved preand post-tax profit for the respective periods.
Year Ended Year Ended 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 Million Million New business contribution 23.7 13.5 Profit from existing business Unwind of discount rate 38.1 32.1 Experience variances 2.8 6.9 Operating assumption changes 0.7 2.8 Investment income 3.2 2.5 Life operating achieved profit before tax 62.9 44.0 Investment return variances 20.6 36.8 Economic assumption changes 2.2 1.2 One off budget changes - 7.6 Cost of solvency capital - 3.6 Life achieved profit before tax 85.7 68.4 Attributed tax 23.4 19.0 Life achieved profit after tax 62.3 49.4 The economic assumption changes reflect the effect of the movement in the economic bases noted in the methodology and assumptions.
The operating assumption changes reflect one-off changes to other assumptions used in the calculation of the achieved profit.
New business contribution after tax is 17.5 million 2003: 10.3 million.
