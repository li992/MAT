Restructuring costs incurred in 2003 of 25.9 million: 18.2 million, related to the reduction of a number of management and support positions across Europe, the integration and reorganisation programme following the acquisition of the Budget business, initial costs of the IT back-ofce project referred to above and the restructuring following the curtailment of a software development project, also referred to above.
b Following the Groups decision to terminate the agreement with the principal contractor on the IT back-ofce project, termination costs of 44.4 million: 30.7 million have been recognised in the current year.
The Group is taking mitigating action against these costs, which may lead to a net credit in future accounting periods.
c As described in Note 10, the Group has recognised an impairment provision against the goodwill in respect of the Budget business and certain French licensee companies.
In 2003, an impairment provision of 7.1 million: 5.0 million was recognised against certain businesses in Germany and an impairment provision of 6.7 million: 4.7 million was recognised against the business in Holland.
d The exceptional charge in 2003 for Centrus amounting to 15.9 million: 11.2 million was to reduce the book values of credit hire receivables to anticipated recoverable amounts.
This exceptional charge was in addition to the termination provisions referred to in ii below.
In 2004, the collection of receivable balances has proved more successful than previously anticipated, such that the current year includes exceptional income of 16.7 million: 11.6 million reecting a reversal of the credit receivable provisions recognised in previous periods.
e Other exceptional items in 2003 comprised of a one-off repayment of VAT in respect of earlier years 3.6 million: 2.6 million and the net amount received in resolving a dispute which had been provided for as an exceptional charge in earlier periods.
In addition to the above, interest income in 2003 included an exceptional amount of 3.6 million: 2.6 million relating to the aforementioned VAT repayment see Note 6.

The Group has granted options to certain Directors and employees over ordinary shares of Avis Europe plc.
Such shares constitute the only category of potentially dilutive ordinary shares and these did not increase the weighted average number of shares in either 2003 or 2004 as the option exercise prices were in excess of the market share price.
Since these options were not dilutive, they had no impact on profit and loss in either year.

As a consequence of the strategic decision in 2003 to terminate the operation of Centrus, see Note 3 ii, the business ceased trading in January 2004.
The goodwill, which had been fully provided against in 2003, has therefore been removed from the balance sheet.
In accordance with the requirements of accounting standard FRS 11, Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, the Group has undertaken a review of the carrying value of xed assets as at 31 December 2004.
The impairment review was to ensure that the carrying value of the Groups assets are stated at no more than their recoverable amount, being the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Following a reassessment of the long-term business plan for Budget, following the completion of the integration of the business acquired in March 2003, and a downturn of the profitability of our operations in France, the Directors have concluded that the recoverable amount of these businesses was less than the carrying amount of the associated assets.
As a consequence, impairment provisions of 30.7 million: 21.5 million, against the goodwill relating to the Budget business and 5.4 million: 3.8 million, against the goodwill relating to certain acquired French licensee companies, have been recognised to write down the value of these assets to their recoverable amounts, representing a full provision against goodwill.
There is no cash ow impact arising from these impairment provisions.
The Directors have also reviewed the carrying values of the goodwill in the business in Greece and the Groups joint venture in China.
Neither of these reviews result in the need for an impairment provision to be recognised.
In determining the value in use, the Directors calculated the present value of the estimated future cash ows expected to arise from the continuing use of the assets using a pre-tax discount rate in the range from 7% to 11%.
The discount rate applied is based upon the Groups weighted average cost of capital with appropriate adjustment for the risks associated with the relevant businesses.
At 31 December 2004, the Group had capital commitments contracted, but not provided for, amounting to 533.5 million: 369.5 million 2003: 863.9 million: 607.1 million.

The pension provision arises from the difference between contributions paid to pension schemes and the amount charged to the profit and loss account.
Further details are set out in Note 23.
Insurance reserves provide for uninsured losses under third party liabilities or claims.
Due to the timescales and uncertainties involved in such claims, provision is made based upon the prole of claims experience, with provision made for potential claims for a number of years after policy inception.
Other trading provisions primarily comprise: a Certain statutory employee termination scheme provisions of 13.2 million: 9.2 million 2003: 12.6 million: 8.9 million that are expected to crystallise within the next few years.
b Dilapidation and environmental provisions of 6.7 million: 4.6 million 2003: 4.5 million: 3.2 million to cover the costs of the remediation of certain properties held under operating leases.

restated, see Note 1 24 Financial instruments The Groups objectives and policies for the use of financial instruments, including derivatives, are detailed in the Operating and Financial Review on pages 8 to 11.
Amounts dealt with in this Note include cash, overdrafts, loan notes, commercial paper, deferred consideration and finance leases, but no other assets and liabilities.
Where applicable, amounts within this Note take account of interest rate swaps and currency swaps.
Amounts borrowed under this programme are repayable in less than one year.
60.0 million 2003: 60.0 million of the proceeds from the loan notes issued in July 2002 are swapped to a oating rate euro liability.
US$240.0 million 2003: nil of the proceeds from the loan notes issued in June 2004 are swapped to a euro liability at a oating rate of interest until June 2005 and a xed rate thereafter.
Apart from the swap proceeds of the loan notes mentioned above, the oating rate financial liabilities principally comprise finance leases, bank loans, commercial paper and overdrafts bearing interest at various rates set with reference to the prevailing EURIBOR or equivalent.
Included in these oating rate amounts are borrowings subject to interest rate caps and collars with an aggregate notional principal of 70.0 million: 48.5 million 2003: 60.0 million: 42.2 million.
The weighted average interest rate and the weighted average period of the xed rate liabilities are as follows: 2004 2003 Weighted Weighted Weighted Weighted average average period average average period xed interest for which xed interest for which rate rate is xed rate rate is xed %Years % Years Currency Euro 5.9 2.8 5.9 2.8 Sterling 6.5 3.5 6.5 4.5 5.9 2.9 5.9 3.0 Deferred consideration of 32.1 million: 22.3 million 2003: 32.1 million: 22.5 million bears an interest rate of 8.0% 2003: 8.0% xed for 33 years 2003: 34 years.
This sterling denominated amount has been excluded from the above analysis.
Excluded from the above tables are forward start interest rate swaps.
They have aggregate notional principals of 50.0 million 2003: 480.0 million, which commence in 2006 2003: commencing in 2004 and 2006 and will run for four years 2003: between three months and four years.
The swaps will convert the prevailing oating interest rate to an average xed rate of 5.2% 2003: 2.9%.
