As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on the sale of properties where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets.
Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount not provided is 10.1m 2003: 13.8m.
At present, it is not envisaged that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
In the past, the Group has incurred significant tax losses in certain overseas jurisdictions, the future utilisation of which is uncertain.
The Group has therefore not recognised a deferred tax asset of 77.7m 2003: 37.7m in respect of tax losses of overseas companies.
In addition, the Group has generated significant UK capital losses from disposals in previous years.
Such losses are only available to offset certain UK capital profits arising in future periods and it is expected to be some time before these losses are relieved.
Accordingly, the Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 15.6m 2003: 15.6m in respect of these losses.

Exchange gains and losses arising from structural currency exposures, net of hedges, are included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Transactional currency exposures Transactional currency exposures arise from trading transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the business.
These exposures give rise to currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
The Group carries on a significant amount of intra-group activity across the world.
To control the currency exposures arising from this trading activity, Exels treasury function Group Treasury operates an inter-company netting system which passes the non-functional currency exchange risk to Group Treasury.
The residual exchange risks are hedged by Group Treasury using forward foreign currency contracts.

The residual leases of these properties range between one year and 20 years.
The Environmental division operates a number of landll sites in the UK.
Provision is made for the costs of restoring and maintaining sites to the condition required by planning and Environment Agency consents.
These provisions will be utilised over the lives of the relevant landll sites which range from two to 20 years and for periods up to 30 years following closure of the site.
The amount and timing of these costs may be impacted by a number of factors including the rate of usage of the site and changes in technology.
Other provisions cover litigation, warranties, property dilapidations and other items.
Utilisation of these provisions is generally within five years.

These schemes cover 40% 2003: 47% of UK employees: dened benefit arrangements account for 60% 2003: 59% of the membership of the schemes.
The latest actuarial valuation of the schemes was made as at 31 March 2003 by Watson Wyatt LLP for the Exel Retirement Plan and the Ocean Nestor Pension Scheme, and as at 6 April 2002 by Punter Southall & Co for The Tibbett & Britten Pension Scheme.
The values of the schemes liabilities at 31 March 2003 have been updated by Watson Wyatt LLP and Punter Southall & Co to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2004 for the purposes of FRS 17 disclosures.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004.
Contributions of 14.1m have been made during the financial year in respect of the Exel Retirement Plan and The Tibbett & Britten Pension Scheme.
No contributions have been made during the financial year, nor will be paid until the conclusion of the March 2006 valuation, in respect of the Ocean Nestor Pension Scheme.
In 2003, the UK dened benefit arrangements were closed to new employees.
Dened contribution sections have been established for new employees within the existing schemes.
The service cost has been assessed using the projected unit method, and so the service cost for the closed dened benefit sections is expected to increase as a percentage of pay as the membership approaches retirement, though this is expected to be offset by the reducing number of members in these sections.
The values of overseas schemes liabilities at 31 December 2004 have been assessed by local actuaries.
The Group also has a number of dened contribution schemes outside the UK.
The disclosures for all of the Groups dened benefit arrangements are aggregated below.
Overseas assets and liabilities are included, but are not material to the totals.
