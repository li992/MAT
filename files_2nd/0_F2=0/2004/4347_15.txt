An actuarial assessment of the Dairy Crest Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2001 by the Funds actuary using the projected unit method.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the assessment were that, over the long term, the annual rate of return on the investments would be 2.5% higher than the increase in pensionable pay, 4.1% higher than the annual increase in present and future pensions in payment and 4.75% higher than the normal level of annual net dividend yield receivable.

The surplus is amortised over the service lives of Fund members on average 11.5 years as an even percentage of payroll resulting in a credit to the profit and loss account of 7.5 million.

FRS 17 was issued in November 2000.
However, it is not mandatory until the financial year ending 31 March 2006.
The company is required to adopt International Accounting Standards IAS for the year ending 31 March 2006 and plans to move directly to the equivalent standard under IAS.
Under FRS 17 certain disclosures are required as to the potential impact on the balance sheet, profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses as if this standard was adopted.
The calculation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 31 March 2001 and updated by Aon Consulting to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004.
This update does not represent a formal valuation.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates.
