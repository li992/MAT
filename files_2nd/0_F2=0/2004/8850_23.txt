Accounting Policies for the year ended 31st March 2004 Accounting convention: The accounts are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention.
Basis of consolidation: The consolidated accounts comprise the accounts of the parent company and all its subsidiary undertakings and include the groups interest in associates.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of in the year are dealt with from or up to the effective date of acquisition or disposal respectively.
The net assets of companies acquired are incorporated in the consolidated accounts at their fair values to the group at the date of acquisition.
The parent company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Turnover: Comprises all invoiced sales of goods and services exclusive of sales taxes.
Financial instruments: The group uses financial instruments, in particular forward currency contracts and currency swaps, to manage the financial risks associated with the groups underlying business activities and the financing of those activities.
The group does not undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
A discussion of how the group manages its financial risks is included in the Financial Review on page 11.
Financial instruments are accounted for as follows: Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
These forward contracts are revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains and losses arising on revaluation are included in other debtors other creditors.
At maturity, or when the contract ceases to be a hedge, gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account.
Currency options are occasionally used to hedge foreign exchange exposures, usually when the forecast receipt or payment amounts are uncertain.
Option premia are recognised at their historic cost in the group balance sheet as prepayments or accruals and released to the profit and loss account, net of any realised gains, on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the option when the outcome becomes certain.
Interest rate swaps are occasionally used to hedge the groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
Currency swaps are used to reduce costs and credit exposure where the group would otherwise have cash deposits and borrowings in different currencies.
The difference between spot and forward rate for these contracts is recognised as part of the net interest payable over the period of the contract.
These swaps are revalued to the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and any aggregate unrealised gains or losses arising on revaluation are included in other debtors other creditors.
Realised gains and losses on these currency swaps are taken to reserves in the same way as for the foreign investments and borrowings to which the swaps relate.
The aggregate fair values at the balance sheet date of the hedging instruments described above are disclosed as a note on the accounts.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption available for short term debtors and creditors.
Foreign currencies: Profit and loss accounts in foreign currencies and cash flows included in the cash flow statement are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the year.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date.
Gains or losses arising on the translation of the net assets of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings are taken to reserves, less exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Research and development expenditure: Charged against profits in the year incurred.
Goodwill: Goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1st April 1998 is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful economic life, which is 20 years or less if it is considered appropriate.
Goodwill previously eliminated against reserves has not been reinstated, but will be charged to the profit and loss account on subsequent disposal of the businesses to which it relates.
Depreciation: Freehold land and certain office buildings are not depreciated.
The depreciation charge and accumulated depreciation of these properties would be immaterial and they are reviewed for impairment annually.
Other fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis at annual rates which vary according to the class of asset, but are typically: leasehold property 3.33% or at higher rates based on the life of the lease : freehold buildings 3.33%: and plant and equipment 10% to 33%.
Leases: The cost of assets held under finance leases is included under tangible fixed assets and the capital element of future lease payments is included in borrowings.
Depreciation is provided in accordance with the groups accounting policy for the class of asset concerned.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements and the interest is charged to the profit and loss account using the annuity method.
Rentals under operating leases are expensed as incurred.
Johnson Matthey 44 Accounting Policies for the year ended 31st March 2004 Grants in respect of capital expenditure: Grants received in respect of capital expenditure are included in creditors and released to the profit and loss account in equal instalments over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Precious metal stocks: Stocks of gold, silver and platinum group metals are valued according to the source from which the metal is obtained.
Metal which has been purchased and committed to future sales to customers or hedged in metal markets is valued at the price at which it is contractually committed or hedged, adjusted for unexpired contango or backwardation.
Leased metal is valued at market prices at the balance sheet date.
Other precious metal stocks owned by the group, which are unhedged, are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Other stocks: These are valued at the lower of cost, including attributable overheads, and net realisable value.
Deferred taxation: Provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date and which could give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Pensions and other retirement benefits: The group operates a number of contributory and non-contributory schemes, mainly of the defined benefit type, which require contributions to be made to separately administered funds.
The cost of the defined contribution schemes is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
For defined benefit schemes, the group recognises the net assets or liabilities of the schemes in the balance sheet, net of any related deferred tax liability or asset.
The changes in scheme assets and liabilities, based on actuarial advice, are recognised as follows: The current service cost, based on the most recent actuarial valuation, is deducted in arriving at operating profit.
The interest cost, based on the present value of scheme liabilities and the discount rate at the beginning of the year and amended for changes in scheme liabilities during the year, is included as interest.
The expected return on scheme assets, based on the fair value of scheme assets and expected rates of return at the beginning of the year and amended for changes in scheme assets during the year, is included as interest.
Actuarial gains and losses, representing differences between the expected return and actual return on scheme assets, differences between the actuarial assumptions underlying the scheme liabilities and actual experience during the year, and changes in actuarial assumptions, are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Past service costs are spread evenly over the period in which the increases in benefit vest and are deducted in arriving at operating profit.
If an increase in benefits vests immediately, the cost is recognised immediately.
Gains or losses arising from settlements or curtailments not covered by actuarial assumptions are included in operating profit.
Employee share ownership trusts ESOTs and long term incentive plan LTIP : The cost of shares held by the ESOTs are deducted in arriving at shareholders funds until they vest unconditionally in employees.
The cost to the group of the LTIP is recognised on a straight line basis over the period to which the performance criteria relate, adjusted for changes in the probability of performance criteria being met or conditional awards lapsing.
The creditor arising from the charge is deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
Changes in accounting policies: Under the provisions of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, which the group adopted on 1st April 2003, the group has restated its accounts to reflect the revised recognition of its retirement benefits schemes and the resultant changes to deferred tax and amounts recognised in the profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Consequently, the group has restated its comparatives for the year ended 31st March 2003.
The effect is to decrease the profit after taxation by 1.8 million in the year ended 31st March 2003.
The groups net assets at 31st March 2003 have decreased by 95.7 million.
No calculation has been performed of the effect on the results for the year ended 31st March 2004 because it was not considered practicable.
Under the provisions of Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, which the group adopted on 1st April 2003, the group has restated its accounts to recognise amounts related to the groups ESOTs and LTIP as a component of shareholders funds.
The effect is to decrease short term investments by 13.8 million and to decrease other creditors falling due within one year by 1.2 million, resulting in net assets decreasing by 12.6 million at 31st March 2003.
There is no effect on the profit and loss account.

The differences are as follows: 2004 2003 restated million million Profit on ordinary activities before taxation, exceptional items and goodwill amortisation 195.7 189.9 Taxation charge at UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2003 30% 58.7 57.0 Effects of: Overseas tax rates 2.1 2.6 Pension credits and contributions 3.0 7.3 Provisions 1.0 3.8 Capital allowances for the year in excess of depreciation 7.9 12.4 Stock adjustments 8.3 6.7 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 0.7 1.4 Net utilisation of tax losses 0.2 1.0 Adjustments for prior years 5.0 0.3 Research and development credits 1.8 1.4 Other 1.2 0.8 Current tax charge for the year 52.1 42.3 Annual Report and Accounts 2004 49 Notes on the Accounts for the year ended 31st March 2004 8c Factors that may affect future tax charges The overall tax rate would be likely to rise if the proportion of profits in overseas territories were to increase reflecting the higher corporation tax rates in those countries in which the group operates.
In addition the tax rate would be impacted by the extent to which losses are available to offset taxable income.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates other than in the case of the groups captive insurance company where cumulative deferred tax of 0.4 million credit for the year 0.1 million has been provided on an accrued dividend.
The group has unprovided deferred tax on capital gains of 65.9 million relating to intra group loans.
This potential tax will not crystallise until the loans are repaid and there is no intention to do so.
The group also has an unrecognised deferred tax asset on approximately 58.1 million of gross capital losses.
Should the gains ever crystallise the losses could be offset against them.
The net unprovided deferred tax is approximately 2.3 million.
9 Dividends 2004 2003 million million Interim ordinary dividend paid 8.2 pence per share 2003 7.8 pence per share 17.9 17.0 Final ordinary dividend proposed 18.2 pence per share 2003 17.7 pence per share 39.5 38.5 Total dividends 57.4 55.5 10 Earnings per ordinary share Profit for the year attributable to shareholders is 121.8 million 2003 restated 120.2 million.
This is divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue calculated as 217,629,033 2003 216,938,883 to give basic earnings per share of 56.0 pence 2003 restated 55.4 pence.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue adjusted by the dilutive outstanding share options and long term incentive plan.
These adjustments give rise to an increase in the weighted average number of shares in issue of 778,267 2003 1,279,946, giving diluted earnings per share of 55.8 pence 2003 restated 55.1 pence.
Before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and the tax thereon, basic earnings per share were 64.0 pence 2003 restated 61.8 pence and diluted earnings per share were 63.7 pence 2003 restated 61.4 pence.

companys pension scheme is a defined benefit scheme which includes employees of the company and some of its UK subsidiaries.
Consequently the company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities and so the company accounts for its contributions to the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
The cost of the companys contributions to the scheme amounted to 12.1 million 2003 11.9 million.
The company also operates the UK post-retirement medical benefits scheme note 11c i which includes some of its employees and a few employees of its UK subsidiaries.
The costs of this scheme are borne by the company and so the schemes liabilities are included in the companys balance sheet.

Interest free financial assets are shares held in publicly quoted companies and an investment in Conduit Ventures Fund.
20b Currency exposures After taking into account the effects of forward exchange contracts the group does not have any significant currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities.
20c Maturity of financial liabilities 2004 2003 million million In one year or less, or on demand 142.2 150.2 In more than one year but not more than two years 66.4 111.8 In more than two years but not more than five years 210.9 151.1 In more than five years 184.9 201.1 604.4 614.2 20d Undrawn committed borrowing facilities 2004 2003 million million Expiring in one year or less 40.0 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 25.4 31.2 Expiring in more than two years 34.8 138.3 60.2 209.5 20e Market price risk The group monitors its interest rate and currency risks and other market price risks to which it is exposed primarily through a process known as sensitivity analysis.
This involves estimating the effect on profit before tax over various periods of possible changes in interest rates and exchange rates.
Most of the groups borrowings and deposits are at floating rates.
A 1% change in all interest rates would have a 1.4% impact on group profit before tax.
This is within the range the board regards as acceptable.
The main impact of movements in exchange rates on the groups results arises on translation of overseas subsidiaries profits into sterling.
The groups largest exposure is to the US dollar since Johnson Mattheys largest single overseas investment is in the US.
A 5 cent 3.0% movement in the average exchange rate for the US dollar against sterling has a 1.2% impact on group profit before tax.
This exposure is part of the groups economic risk of operating globally which is essential to remain competitive in the markets in which the group operates.

The fair values of the bonds and interest rate swaps are calculated by discounting future cash flows to net present values using appropriate market interest rates prevailing at the year end.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts represents the unrealised gain or loss on revaluation of the contracts to year end exchange rates.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to their size, short term nature or the fact that they bear interest at floating rates.
20g Gains and losses on hedges Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
