7 Earnings per share and results before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on a profit for the year of 12.6m 2003 23.8m and 145.6m 2003 141.9m shares, being a daily average of the shares in issue during the year.
Diluted earnings per share 8.4p is based on the same profits but with the number of shares increased to 149.7m 2003 141.9m to reflect relevant share options granted but not yet exercised where performance conditions have been met and shares contingently issuable in respect of the acquisition of Centurion Wireless Technologies, Inc. Earnings per share before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation is shown as the Board considers it to be a relevant guide to the performance of the Group.
The tax charge for the year before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, calculated after adding back certain exceptional tax credits of nil 2003 8.5m, is equivalent to 20% 2003 18% of the profit before operating exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and loss on disposal of businesses.

Approximately 650 2003 700 employees are members of seven different defined benefit schemes and these schemes have approximately 1,800 2003 1,900 deferred and current pensioners.
The employer contributions made to these schemes during the year was 2.1m 2003 2.1m.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension costs are assessed by independent actuaries, full actuarial valuations being made every three years using either the projected unit or attained age methods.
The most recent actuarial valuations were made between December 2001 and April 2004.
The Group has changed its accounting policy for pensions during 2004 by fully adopting FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Accordingly comparative figures have been restated for both the Group and the Company.
This change has resulted in a prior year adjustment to equity shareholders funds of the Group by the net deficit after a deferred tax credit of 7.0m Company, net deficit of 1.7m.
The Group profit and loss account for the year ending 31 December 2003 is unaffected by the adoption of FRS 17.
The total assessed value of the schemes assets at 31 December 2004 at their market value is estimated at 64m 2003 61m and the liabilities estimated at 79m 2003 71m.
The resultant aggregate net pension liability under FRS 17 is 15m 2003 10m, which resulted in a decrease in the Groups reserves of 13m 2003 9m, being the 15m 2003 10m net pension liability offset by 2m 2003 1m of related deferred tax.
Since last year equity markets have risen, however this increase has not been sufficient to offset reductions in corporate bond yields and higher longevity assumptions for the schemes members which impact upon the value of discounted liabilities, resulting in a higher aggregate net pension liability.
The market value of the schemes assets, the present value of the schemes liabilities and the net pension liability under FRS 17 at 31 December were as follows: Group 2004 2003 restated m m Annuities 10.4 11.1 Equities 34.8 31.3 Gilts and bonds 17.2 16.0 Other including cash 2.2 2.8 Total market value of assets 64.6 61.2 Present value of scheme liabilities 79.4 71.1 Deficit in the schemes 14.8 9.9 Related deferred tax asset 1.9 1.4 Net pension liability 12.9 8.5 49 The Laird Group PLC Notes to the accounts note 9 Employees continued Company 2004 2003 restated m m Annuities 5.5 5.9 Equities 5.0 4.5 Gilts and bonds 3.8 3.1 Other including cash 0.5 1.4 Total market value of assets 14.8 14.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 20.6 18.1 Deficit in the schemes 5.8 3.2 Related deferred tax asset 0.9 0.5 Net pension liability 4.9 2.7 There are minor variations in the assumptions used by the different actuaries employed to value the separate schemes.
The expected long term rates of return on gilts and bonds are estimated at 4.6% per annum 2003 4.8% and those for equities at 8.2% per annum 2003 8.5%.
The returns on the annuities match the relevant liabilities.
For FRS 17 the schemes liabilities have mainly been calculated under the projected unit method and the main financial assumptions were inflation of 2.7% per annum 2003 2.7%, salary increases of 3.7% per annum 2003 3.7% and a discount rate for liabilities of 5.4% per annum 2003 5.6%.
Some of the schemes provide pensions with increases linked to the cost of living, but the majority of pensions in payment and deferred pensions have no guaranteed increases.

Currency exposure is largely on translation as the value of cross currency transactions is limited with most of the transactions in local currency.
The Groups policy is for subsidiaries to take out forward foreign exchange contracts to cover their net transaction exposures to foreign currencies.
Balance sheet translation exposures are partly hedged by funding overseas subsidiaries with local currency borrowings.
The Group does not have any significant transactional currency exposures on financial assets and liabilities on which net currency gains and losses would be recognised in the profit and loss account.
