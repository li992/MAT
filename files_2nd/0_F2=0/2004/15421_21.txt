2001 Equity Participation Plan EPP Executive directors and selected employees are eligible to participate in the plan at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Under the plan, employees may deposit group shares, which they have previously purchased to a market value not exceeding 50 per cent of their base salary in any one year.
In return, a matching award is granted over shares with a market value on the day of grant equal to half the pre-tax amount that would have been required by the individual to acquire the deposited shares.
A matching award will normally be exercisable between the third and tenth anniversaries of its grant, and is conditional upon the deposited shares being retained and the executive remaining in employment at the time of exercise.
The plan has been structured primarily as a recognition and retention vehicle for high-performing, key employees.
It also provides an incentive for executives to build and maintain a shareholding in the company through purchases of shares, thereby creating a clear alignment with shareholders.
The maximum value of matching awards is 25 per cent of gross base pay and, given this magnitude, there have been no performance conditions attached to awards up to and including 2004.
However, performance conditions will be attached to matching awards for any main board participants going forward.
In 2004, 15 high-performing, key employees received and accepted the groups invitation to participate in the EPP, depositing an average of 21 per cent of base salary in company shares.
These will be matched after three years, conditional upon continued employment and the retention of their deposited shares as outlined above.
The EPP is included in the LTIP review.
Worldwide Employee Sharesave Plan WESP The companys WESP was adopted in 1999, replacing the Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS.
The plan is a share option plan in which the employee saves from salary, up to a maximum of 150 per month, over a fixed period of time, for a minimum of three years, and is then given the opportunity to purchase fixed price shares, which may sometimes be at a discount to market value, from his or her fund.
The group uses the plan to encourage ownership of shares by employees and the WESP will be operated again in 2005.
For the 2004 invitation, the group replaced the WESP operating in the US with a more appropriate and tax-efficient section 423 qualified stock purchase plan, the Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP.
This allows US employees to benefit from local tax dispensations and encourages increased participation.
In 2004, 1.0 million shares were awarded to 472 employees under the WESP.
Long-term incentive plan LTIP The companys LTIP is used to make awards of shares to selected employees and executive directors in recruitment or acute retention situations, or other exceptional circumstances, at the discretion of the remuneration committee.
Awards under the LTIP may be structured as nil cost options or requiring the payment of an exercise price, which is set at the time of the grant.
Performance conditions, set by the remuneration committee, are normally attached to awards.
For 2000 and 2001 awards, the real compound annual growth of the groups EPS before goodwill charges over three consecutive financial years must exceed at least 6 per cent.
In most cases, the options are only exercisable in full if the rate so calculated is 12 per cent.
For most other awards under the LTIP, vesting will occur at the EPS performance hurdles described for the ESP on page 76 above.
Vesting normally occurs after three years and, depending on the year of grant, there are different performance conditions.
For awards made under the plan prior to 2001, where 6 per cent and 12 per cent performance hurdles are used, re-testing may occur on a rolling three-year basis throughout the life of the plan.
For all awards made under the plan after 2001, where the 4 per cent and 8 per cent performance hurdles are used, fixed-base re-testing may occur after years four and five only.
There is currently only one outstanding award under the LTIP to which no performance measures were attached.
This was described in detail in the 2002 remuneration report and is summarised in the table on page 80.
In 2004, the committee made a one-off award of 180,000 nil cost options to David Lowden, to reflect his promotion to the key role of Chief Operating Officer.
The award is subject to the EPS performance conditions described for the ESP on page 76 above, except that performance will be measured over a five-year period, with no re-testing, thereby promoting retention.
In 2004, approximately 280,000 options were granted to two employees under the LTIP.
This plan is included in the LTIP review.
77 the sixth sense of business Performance graph This graph illustrates the performance of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc and the FTSE All Share Media & Entertainment Index over the past five years.
We have historically used the FTSE 250 index for this purpose.
However, we are proposing that we move to a new LTIP, details of which are set out in the shareholder circular.
If this plan is approved at the AGM, we would base an element of the awards under it on TSR, which would reflect relative performance against a peer group, largely comprising constituents of the FTSE All Share Media & Entertainment index.
For this reason we show below our performance against this index.
Total shareholder return at 31 December Taylor Nelson Sofres 120 FTSE Media & Entertainment Index 100 This graph shows the value, by 31 December 2004, of 80 100 invested in Taylor Nelson Sofres on 31 December 1999 compared with the value of 100 invested in the 60 FTSE All Share Media & Entertainment Index.

His three year consultancy agreement with the group ended on 31 October 2004, for which he received 250,000 in respect of 2004 300,000 for 2003.
He remains President of the supervisory board of TNS Sofres in France, for which there is no direct remuneration but he receives benefits of 100,000 per year.
Notes 1 Andy Boland was appointed to the board on 12 January 2004.
2Tony Cowling elected to sacrifice 98,073 of his base salary into his pension.
3 Following substantial enlargement of the group, Mike Kirkhams remuneration was reviewed to bring it into line with chief executives in comparable companies.
The 2003 remuneration report noted that under the 2004 bonus plan an executive may elect to sacrifice part, or all, of his or her annual bonus and request an enhancement to his or her pension plan in lieu.
This provision was also in effect for the 2003 bonus plan and Mike Kirkham elected to receive 147,440 of the amount disclosed as bonus in that report in the form of contributions to his pension.
Similarly, 190,894 of the amount disclosed as bonus for 2004 above was received in the form of contributions to his pension.
Mike Kirkham also elected to sacrifice 41,580 of his 2004 base salary into pension, which the company matched at a ratio of 1.5:1.0.
4William Lipner was appointed to the board on 17 July 2003 and left the company on 12 May 2004.
In accordance with the terms of the service agreement he held with NFO he received a severance payment of 358,117, equivalent to nine months salary and bonus.
He was also entitled to receive health insurance and other benefits for a period of three years, which were replaced as part of his termination agreement by three annual payments with an estimated total value of 163,755.
Under the termination agreement the company was released from any further funding obligations or potential liabilities relating to Mr Lipners supplementary pension arrangement in return for payments totalling 3,529,678.
After taking into account the associated relief against corporation tax, the impact of terminating the supplementary pension arrangement was cash and earnings neutral to the group.
5 Fees to Stephan Buck include 12,000 as payment for consulting services to the group.
6 Jacques-Henri David retired from the board on 31 January 2003.
7 Sharon Studer was appointed to the board on 12 November 2003.
