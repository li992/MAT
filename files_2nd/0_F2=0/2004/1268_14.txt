co. uk 15 Pensions At 31 December 2004 the Group operated a number of retirement benefit schemes, both defined benefit and defined contribution which are financed through separate Trustee administered funds managed by independent professional fund managers on behalf of the Trustees.
Contributions to the defined benefit funds are based upon actuarial advice following the most recent of a regular series of valuations of the funds by their representative independent actuaries.
Certain employees of Arriva Merseyside Limited participate in the Local Government Pension Scheme.
This is a defined benefit scheme funded by payments to the Merseyside Pension Fund.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Merseyside Pension Fund was carried out as at 31 March 2001.
For the purpose of arriving at the pension cost charged in the accounts the defined benefit funds including Arrivas share of the Merseyside Pension Fund were last assessed on 5 April 2003 by their respective actuaries, using the Projected Unit Method.
The principal actuarial assumptions were that: i the annual rate of return on investment would be 2.75 per cent higher than the annual increase in total pensionable remuneration of 3.75 per cent and, where relevant, ii there would be no variation from a schemes rules to pensions in payment.
On the basis of these assumptions the actuarial value of the funds at 5 April 2003 was sufficient to cover 85 per cent of the benefits then accrued to members.
A net prepayment of 34.4 million 2003: 32.2 million is included in the accounts.
The market value of the various schemes assets at 5 April 2003 was 327 million.
Certain employees of Arriva Trains Wales, and the former employees of Arriva Trains Northern, participated in funded defined benefit sections which form part of the overall Railways Pension Scheme RPS.
The accounting policy is to charge the contributions to these pension sections to the profit and loss account in accordance with actuarial advice.
This is on the basis that there is no recourse to the Group for any over or under funding of their sections of the RPS following expiry of the franchises.
In December 2004, the Arriva Trains Northern franchise ceased operations.
The total pension cost for Group was 47.0 million 2003: 35.2 million.
The pension cost in respect of Groups defined contribution schemes was 23.1 million 2003: 14.9 million.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will be mandatory for Arriva plc and its subsidiaries for the year ending 31 December 2005.
Prior to this, transitional disclosures are required, and these are set out below.
The directors believe that separate consideration should be given to the RPS under FRS 17 as the Group has no rights or obligations in respect of these schemes following the expiry of the franchises.
The amounts relating to the rail schemes are therefore shown separately and relate to sections in respect of Arriva Trains Wales Limited only.
The calculations used to assess the FRS 17 liabilities of the Groups retirement benefit schemes are based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated by Mercer Human Resource Consulting to 31 December 2004.
The same financial assumptions have been used for each of the schemes.
The schemes assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004.
The following financial assumptions have been used for each of the schemes: 2004 2003 2002 Valuation method Projected Unit Projected Unit Projected Unit Discount rate 5.4% 5.4% 5.6% Inflation rate 2.6% 2.5% 2.3% Increases to deferred benefits during deferment 2.6% 2.5% 2.3% Increases to pensions in payment 2.6% 2.5% 2.3% Salary increases 3.85% 3.75% 3.8% Expected long-term rate of return at 31 December, before deduction for scheme expenses: Equities 7.5% 7.8% 7.5% Bonds 4.9% 5.0% 4.7% Other 4.5% 4.8% 4.5% Weighted average expected long-term rate of return by scheme at 31 December 6.9% 7.1% 6.7% Arriva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 49 www.
