This supplementary information has been approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by: Julian V F Roberts Group Finance Director 28 February 2005 Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information | 145 5 BASIS OF PREPARATION This supplementary information has been prepared in accordance with the methodology for supplementary reporting for long term insurance business the Achieved Profits Method issued in December 2001 by the Association of British Insurers.
The objective of the Achieved Profits Method is to recognise profit as it is earned arising from contracts of long term assurance business.
The methodology is based on an attribution of the assets of a life assurance company between those backing long term assurance contracts backing assets and the residual assets representing unencumbered capital.
The backing assets cover: i the long term liabilities calculated in accordance with local supervisory requirements: and ii the solvency capital requirements in each country or equivalent where there is no local requirement.
Under the Achieved Profits Method the profits of the long term assurance business comprise: i the cash transfers to the residual assets from the backing assets as determined following the statutory valuation: ii the movement over the accounting period in the present value of the expected future cash flows to the residual assets from contracts in-force at the balance sheet date and their backing assets: and iii the return on the residual assets.
Shareholder profit arises fundamentally from: i the difference between a the amounts charged to policyholders for guarantees, expenses and insurance and b the actual experience of these items: and ii the investment return earned on capital.
In addition for the United States business, the guarantees for interest credited to policyholders funds are reset periodically.
The assumed future credited interest rates are consistent with investment earnings made and in line with recent Company policy.
The treatment within this supplementary information of all business other than life assurance business is unchanged from the statutory financial statements.

Expected return on the unencumbered capital for South Africa and the United States is 12.5% p. a.
For South Africa the expected return is applied to the average unencumbered capital given in section 6.
The South African operating assumption changes of 106 million R1,251 million for 2004 include: a 60 million R708 million before tax increase in the value of in-force business in respect of an increase in discretionary mortality margins in the Financial Soundness Valuation FSV, which arose as a result of a reduction in Individual Business mortality assumptions, reflecting positive experience variances, b 62 million R732 million before tax increase in the value of in-force business in respect of sources of profit that have not previously been valued, and c other changes to valuation methodology and assumptions.
The segmental results of the United States include the operating profit generated by Old Mutual Reassurance Ireland Limited OMRe, which provides reinsurance to the United States life companies, and OMNIA Life Bermuda Limited.
During 2004, all the deferred annuity business reinsured with OMRe was recaptured by the United States life companies.
The effect of this recapture was to reduce the life assurance achieved profit for 2004 by 31 million R366 million before tax which is included within experience variances.
The effect of changes in and cost of solvency capital for South Africa reflects changes in the amount of solvency capital required and in the mix of assets backing the solvency capital.
The effect of FSV economic assumption changes in 2003 reflects the impact of reducing the economic assumptions for the South African actuarial liability valuation by 3% p. a.
The effect of BoE Life in 2003 reflects the recognition of the initial value of the in-force business on acquisition.
The difference between the total tax charge shown in the above segmental analysis and the total tax charge shown in the profit and loss account in section 1, represents the tax charge on the non-life businesses.

Annual Premium Equivalent APE is calculated as recurring premiums plus 10% of single premiums.
New business profitability, as measured by the ratio of the VNB to the APE, is also shown under Margin below.
The value of new business is disclosed both on a gross and after tax basis.
The assumptions and tax rates used to calculate the value of new business are set out in section 9.
The new business shown above for the United States for 31 December 2003 excludes the value of OMNIA Life Bermuda business that was acquired during 2003, and which is included within the value of new business shown in section 7.
The value of new individual unit trust and some group market-linked business written by the life companies is excluded, as the profits on this business arise in the asset management subsidiaries.
The value of new business also excludes premium increases arising from indexation arrangements in respect of existing business, as these are already included in the value of in-force business.
The premiums shown for the United States exclude reinsurance ceded externally.

The pre-tax investment and economic assumptions used for South African and United States businesses were as follows: At At 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 South Africa Fixed interest return 8.3% 9.4% Cash return 7.0% Equity return 10.3% 11.4% Property return 9.3% 10.4% Inflation 5.3% 6.4% Risk discount rate 10.8% 11.9% United States Treasury yield 4.3% 4.3% Inflation 3.0% 3.0% New money yield assumed 5.1% 6.0% Net portfolio earned rate 5.9% 6.4% Risk discount rate 8.3% 8.3% For the other operations, appropriate investment and economic assumptions were chosen on bases consistent with those adopted in South Africa.
Where applicable, rates of future bonuses have been set at levels consistent with the investment return assumptions.
Projected company taxation is based on the current tax basis that applies in each country.
For the South African business, full allowance has been made for STC that may be payable in South Africa.
Account has been taken of the impact of CGT in South Africa.
It has been assumed that 10% of the equity portfolio excluding group subsidiaries will be traded each year.
For the United States business full allowance has been made for existing tax attributes of the companies, including the use of existing carry forwards and preferred tax credit investments.
Achieved profits results are initially calculated on an after tax basis and are then grossed up to the pre-tax level for presentation in the profit and loss account and the segmental analysis of results.
The tax rates used were the effective corporation tax rates of 37.8% for South Africa 2003: 37.8%, 30% for the United States 2003: 25% and 0% for the United Kingdom and the Rest of World 2003: 0% except for the investment return on South African capital, for which the attributed tax was derived from the primary accounts.
The assumed future mortality, morbidity and voluntary discontinuance rates have been based as far as possible on analyses of recent operating experience.
Allowance has been made where appropriate for the effect of expected AIDS-related claims.
The management expenses attributable to life assurance business have been analysed between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business and the maintenance of business in-force.
The future expenses attributable to life assurance business do not include Group holding company expenses.
Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information | 153 9 ASSUMPTIONS continued No material allowance has been made for future development costs.
Future investment expenses are based on the current scales of fees payable by the life assurance companies to the asset management subsidiaries.
To the extent that these fees include profit margins for the asset management subsidiaries, these margins have not been included in the value of in-force business or the value of new business.
The effect of increases in premiums over the period for policies in-force has been included in the value of in-force business only where such increases are associated with indexation arrangements.
Other increases in premiums of existing policies are included in the value of new business.
New schemes written on which recurring single premiums are expected to be received on a regular basis are treated as new business.
The annualised premium is recognised as recurring premium new business at inception of the scheme and is determined by annualising the actual premiums received during the year in question.
Subsequent recurring single premiums received in future years are not treated as new business, as these have already been provided for in calculating the value of in-force business.
The sensitivity of the value of in-force and value of new business to changes in key assumptions are set out in section 10.
The principal exchange rates used to translate the operating results of key foreign business segments to Sterling are: Rand US$ 2004 2003 2004 2003 Profit and loss account average rate for the year 11.7986 12.3487 1.8327 1.6354 Balance sheet closing rate at 31 December 10.8482 11.9367 1.9158 1.7833 154 | Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information Achieved Profits Basis Supplementary Information for the year ended 31 December 2004 continued 10 ALTERNATIVE ASSUMPTIONS The tables below for South Africa and the United States show the sensitivity of the value of in-force at 31 December 2004 and the value of new business for the year to 31 December 2004 to changes in key assumptions.
For each sensitivity illustrated, all other assumptions have been left unchanged.
