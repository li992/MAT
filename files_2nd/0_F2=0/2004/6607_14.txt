Management believes that exclusion of these items provides a better comparison of the way in which the business was managed and gives an indication of the performance of the Group in terms of those elements of revenue and expenditure which local management was able to inuence.
This information, which is provided in addition to the statutory results prepared under UK GAAP, is given to assist shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business and to increase comparability for the periods presented.
Statutory results include these items.
For 2004, with the completion of these programmes, the Group is reporting results on a statutory basis only.
