ii The tax charge is reduced by the utilisation of overseas losses brought forward and profits of certain overseas territories taxed at rates lower than the UK rate.
iii The deferred tax asset on the balance sheet is largely in respect of UK and Japanese timing differences.

Borrowings The following disclosures describe the Companys borrowings and facilities at 24 April 2004 and 26 April 2003.
2 Borrowings are stated gross of cash balances, after unamortised deferred financing fees.
Senior Facility Agreement The syndicated bank Senior Facility Agreement consists of a 225m term loan facility and a 150m revolving credit facility.
The committed facilities under these agreements are as set out below.
Total available at 24 April 26 April 2004 2003 Facility m m Sterling amortising term loan facility 225.0 250.0 Multi-currency revolving credit facility 150.0 150.0 Total 375.0 400.0 Deferred financing fees totalling 8.4m relating to the arrangement of the Senior Facility Agreement are being amortised over the five year term of the Senior Facility Agreement.
Interest on advances under the Senior Facility Agreement was payable from 23 May 2003 at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 0.875%.
Prior to this date the rate per annum was equal to LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5%.
Security The borrowings under the Senior Facility Agreement are secured by the Guarantors that comprise HMV Group plc and any wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Company who accede to the Senior Facility Agreement as guarantors.
As a condition of the Agreement, the aggregate gross assets, revenue and profit before interest and tax of the Guarantors must comprise not less than 75% of the total gross assets, revenue and profit before tax and interest of the Company and its subsidiaries.
The Guarantors currently comprise HMV Group plc, HMV Music Limited, Waterstones Booksellers Limited, HMV IP Limited and HMV UK Limited.
The Company has granted security comprising first ranking fixed and floating charges over all the assets and undertakings of the Guarantors.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offset arrangements are reflected in the Group balance sheet as appropriate.
Derivatives and other financial instruments Objectives, policies and strategies for the role of derivatives and the other financial instruments The Group finances itself through cash generated by operations and bank borrowings.
The financial instruments of the Group comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources, derivatives and various items including trade debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The Group has committed bank facilities comprising a Sterling denominated term loan of 225m and a revolving credit facility of 150m, which provides funding for its operations in the UK and indirectly to its operations in other territories, through letter of credit provisions.
The Group may also provide funds to overseas subsidiaries by lending intra-Group on commercial terms, or by issuing a guarantee in respect of local bank borrowings.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions and has procedures in place to monitor and control their use.
The Groups use of derivatives is to modify the currency exposure of its debt to match underlying cash flow and assets, to limit borrowing costs and to hedge product purchases.
In all cases underlying exposures justify the use of derivatives.
The financial risks to which the Group is exposed, described below, are managed by Treasury using policies approved by the Board.
Notes to the financial statements continued 63 HMV Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 18.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The Group has committed bank facilities comprising a term loan of 225m and a revolving credit facility of 150m, which together with cash on deposit provides sufficient funding for the Groups operations.
The adequacy of the funding arrangements is reviewed regularly.
Interest rate risk The Groups bank term debt carries a variable rate of interest linked to prevailing interest rates.
In order to mitigate the risk of a rise in interest rates, the Group has entered into several interest rate derivative contracts such that 67% of the term debt at 24 April 2004 carries a fixed rate of interest.
The position is reviewed regularly and the Groups strategy going into 2004 05 is to use the Groups cash as a natural interest rate hedge, thus reducing the level of interest rate derivative contracts.
Consequently, from May 2004 the Group expects to have interest rate contracts in place to hedge approximately 33% of the total debt but the Groups cash will increase the level of interest rate hedge to over 50%, in line with Group policy.
The net exposure will continue to be monitored throughout the year.
Counterparty risk Treasury deposits any cash balances that arise with counterparties that have a strong credit rating, with an agreed limit for each counterparty, so as to limit the risk of loss arising from a failure.
Counterparties include AAA-rated Liquidity funds, and various banks.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the foreign exchange risk of imports where volumes are significant.
However, the Groups operating businesses generally source the majority of their product from suppliers within their country of operation and so the foreign exchange exposure is small.
The Group is also exposed to foreign currency translation risk through its investment in overseas subsidiaries.
This is partially hedged by local debt, but the Group does not hedge the remaining exposure.
Generally, the Group does not hedge any net translation exposure of overseas earnings, although it may in certain circumstances implement hedges to secure short-term financial objectives.
All Group borrowings are stated gross of deferred financing fees as shown in Note 17 on page 62.

Although these locally provided facilities nominally expired in less than one year, they could be renewed provided that the letter of credit drawn under the revolving credit facility is renewed.
The table above reflects the undrawn portion of these locally provided facilities as expiring in less than one year.
As at 24 April 2004, letters of credit issued totalled 23.1m, of which 13.2m was undrawn 2003: 13.8m.
Also, the Group has given a parent guarantee to support an uncommitted local facility totalling 2.2m, which was undrawn at 24 April 2004.

Pension arrangements HMV Group employees are members of a number of pension schemes.
The main scheme that covers employees in the United Kingdom is the HMV Group Pension Scheme the Scheme established with effect from July 1998.
The Scheme The Scheme is based in the UK and has two sections the Pension Benefit Section and the Pension Saver Section.
Pension Benefit Section The Pension Benefit Section is of the defined benefit type and is an Inland Revenue exempt approved scheme for the purpose of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
It is contracted out of SERPS.
The benefits it provides are based on final pensionable pay and are guaranteed to increase in payment by 5% per annum or by the increase in the cost of living, if less.
Members contribute at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
A qualified actuary made an actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2002.
The valuation was based on an assumed investment return of 7.0% a year, salary increases of 4.0% a year, and annual pension increases of 2.5%, and used the projected unit method.
The result of the valuation was a level of asset cover of 94%, representing a funding deficit of 0.9m.
In addition, the total cost of accruing benefits was given as 16.8% of pensionable pay including an allowance for administrative expenses, of which members of the Pension Benefit Section pay 4.0%, leaving the Groups regular cost at 12.8% of pensionable pay.
The market value of the assets of the Pension Benefit Scheme at 30 June 2002 was about 13.1m.
Since this review 543 members transferred into the Scheme on 31 May 2003 transfer value 24.1m as further described under The EMI Group Pension Fund below.
Other than this transfer, the Scheme was generally closed to new members with effect from 1 January 2002.
The next actuarial review will take place no later than 30 June 2005.
In the light of the small deficit of assets over the cost of benefits, the Group has contributed at a rate of 12.9% of pensionable pay from 1 June 2003.
This rate, calculated in accordance with the recommendations of the actuary, is sufficient to eliminate the deficit over a period of seven years.
Actual employer contributions to the Pension Benefit Section for the 52 weeks ended 24 April 2004, including those in relation to new members transferring from the EMI Fund, were 3.0m 2003: 1.0m.
Pension Saver Section The Pension Saver Section is of the defined contribution type and is open to all permanent and temporary staff of the Group aged between 18 and 64 years.
Members can choose to pay from 2% to 5% of pensionable pay.
The Group matches the amount paid by the member up to a maximum of 5% of pensionable pay.
Members have a choice of ways to invest their and the Groups contributions in an individual fund to buy pension benefits of their choice.
It also provides life assurance whilst members are employed by the Group.
The EMI Group Pension Fund the Fund The flotation of the Companys shares on the London Stock Exchange on 15 May 2002 and the concurrent dilution of EMI Group plcs investment in the Company started a process of separation of pension arrangements, which was completed with effect from 31 May 2003.
The separation of pension arrangements provided each member of the Fund with the option of taking up membership of the Scheme.
For the 543 members who so elected transferring members, a transfer was paid from the Fund to the Scheme totalling 24,059,000 in respect of their accrued rights.
The benefits granted to transferring members were broadly comparable with those which they had individually accrued in the Fund.
Certain executives are entitled to enhanced levels of benefits under the Fund as executive members.
Some of those executives are subject to the earnings cap which limits the amount of their salary which may be treated as pensionable under an Inland Revenue exempt approved pension scheme and are members, or may become eligible for membership, of top-up arrangements for life insurance, pension and disability benefits.
Employer expense in respect of the Fund, calculated in accordance with the recommendations of the actuary, would have represented a credit to the Profit and Loss Account on full application of SSAP 24 principles.
However, for reasons of conservatism, such expense was taken as nil for the 52 weeks ended 26 April 2003 and for the period 27 April to 31 May 2003.
From the date of final pensions separation, the transferring members are included in the calculation of the expense disclosed in relation to the Scheme above.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits In accordance with the transitional implementation rules set out in FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, additional disclosures are set out below.
These have been updated by professionally qualified actuaries to take into account the requirements of FRS 17 and to assess the liabilities of the Scheme at 24 April 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 24 April 2004.
Disclosures for the period ended 24 April 2004 are inclusive of the enlarged membership following the transfer of 543 members from the EMI Fund on 31 May 2003.

Consequently, it took advantage of the exemption in FRS 17 and treated the Fund on a defined contribution basis until the arrangement ceased and the members transferred to the HMV Scheme.
Accordingly, no FRS 17 transitional disclosures were required at 26 April 2003.

Impact of change in accounting policy Following the introduction of UITF 38 and UITF 17 revised the Group has changed its accounting policy for own shares.
Previously the Groups investment in own shares was included as an investment at cost less accumulated amortisation, unless there was seen to have been a permanent diminution in value, in which case the investments were written down to realisable value.
In accordance with UITF 38 the cost of such shares is now treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
The impact of this change in accounting policy has been to reduce investments and shareholders funds by 271,000, reduce accruals by 312,000 and increase the profit and loss reserve by 583,000.
The impact on the reported net liabilities of the group as at 24 April 2004 of not adopting the new Accounting Policies would have been to reduce net liabilities by 0.4m.
