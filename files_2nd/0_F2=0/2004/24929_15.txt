HSBC operates through long-established businesses and has an international network of over 9,800 ofces in 77 countries and territories in Europe, the Asia-Pacic region, the Americas, the Middle East and Africa, and serves over 110 million customers.
A review of the development of the business of Group undertakings during the year and an indication of likely future developments are given on pages 5 to 37. Dividend First, second and third interim dividends, each of US$0.13 per ordinary share were paid on 7 July 2004, 6 October 2004 and 20 January 2005 respectively.
The Directors have declared a fourth interim dividend of US$0.27 per ordinary share in lieu of a final dividend, making a total distribution for the year of US$7,301 million.
The fourth interim dividend will be payable on 4 May 2005 in cash in United States dollars, or in sterling or Hong Kong dollars, or a combination of these currencies, at exchange rates to be determined on 25 April 2005, with a scrip dividend alternative.
A financial calendar, including the key dates for payment of the fourth interim dividend for 2004, is on pages 70 to 71.
Corporate Governance Report The information set out on pages 186 to 234 of the Annual Report and Accounts and information incorporated by reference constitutes the Corporate Governance Report of HSBC Holdings.
HSBC is committed to high standards of corporate governance.
HSBC Holdings complied throughout the year with the code provisions of the Combined Code on corporate governance appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and with the provisions of Appendix 14 to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited.
Appendix 14 to the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited was substantially revised during 2004.
The new provisions of Appendix 14 will apply for subsequent reporting periods.
Board of Directors The objectives of the management structures within HSBC, headed by the Board of Directors of HSBC Holdings and led by the Group Chairman, are to deliver sustainable value to shareholders.
Implementation of the strategy set by the Board is delegated to the Group Management Board under the leadership of the Group Chief Executive.
The Board sets the strategy for HSBC through the five-year strategic plan and approves the annual operating plans presented by management for the achievement of the strategic objectives.
The annual operating plans ensure the efficient disposition of HSBCs resources for the achievement of these objectives.
The Board delegates the management and day to day running of HSBC to the Group Management Board but retains to itself approval of certain matters including annual plans and performance targets, procedures for monitoring and control of operations, specified senior appointments, acquisitions and disposals above predetermined thresholds and any substantial change in balance sheet management policy.
The Board of Directors meets regularly and Directors receive information between meetings about the activities of committees and developments in HSBCs business.
All Directors have full and timely access to all relevant information and may take independent professional advice if necessary.
HSBC Holdings has a unitary Board of Directors.
The authority of each Director is exercised in Board meetings where the Board acts collectively as a unit.
At 1 March 2005, the Board will comprise seven executive and 15 nonexecutive Directors.
The roles of Group Chairman and Group Chief Executive are separated and held by experienced executive Directors.
The division of responsibilities between the Group Chairman and the Group Chief Executive is clearly established, set out in writing and agreed by the Board.
Before assuming the role of Group Chairman in 1998, Sir John Bond had been the Group Chief Executive for five years.
The Group Chairmans knowledge of HSBCs complex and widespread geographical business from his previous service as Group Chief Executive has been a considerable benefit to HSBC.
44 Executive Directors are employees who carry out executive functions in HSBC in addition to their duties as Directors.
Non-executive Directors are not HSBC employees and do not participate in the daily business management of HSBC.
Non-executive Directors constructively challenge and help develop proposals on strategy, scrutinise the performance of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives, and monitor the reporting of performance.
Non-executive Directors serve as members of Board committees.
It is estimated that non-executive Directors spend 24 days per annum on HSBC business after an induction phase, with committee members devoting significant additional time.
The names and brief biographical particulars of the Directors are listed on pages 38 to 41.
The Board considers all of the non-executive Directors to be independent in character and judgement.
Baroness Dunn and H Sohmen have served on the Board for more than nine years, however, and in that respect only, do not meet the usual criteria for independence set out in the UK Combined Code on corporate governance.
The Board has therefore determined Lord Butler, R K F Chien, J D Coombe, R A Fairhead, W K L Fung, S Hintze, J W J Hughes-Hallett, Sir John Kemp-Welch, Sir Brian Moffat, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, S W Newton, C S Taylor and Sir Brian Williamson to be independent.
In reaching its determination of each non-executive Directors independence, the Board has concluded that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect the Directors judgement and any relationships or circumstances which could appear to do so were considered not to be material.
In accordance with the Rules Governing the Listing of Securities on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange each non-executive Director determined by the Board to be independent has provided conrmation of his or her independence to HSBC Holdings.
The Directors who served during the year were W F Aldinger, Sir John Bond, Lord Butler, R K F Chien, CFWdeCroisset, W R P Dalton, Baroness Dunn, D G Eldon, R A Fairhead, D J Flint, W K L Fung, M F Geoghegan, S K Green, S Hintze, A W Jebson, Sir John Kemp-Welch, Lord Marshall, Sir Brian Moffat, Sir Mark Moody-Stuart, S W Newton, H Sohmen, C S Taylor and Sir Brian Williamson.
C F W fide Croisset retired as a Director on 27 February 2004 and W R P Dalton and Lord Marshall retired as Directors on 28 May 2004.
R A Fairhead and M F Geoghegan were appointed Directors with effect from 1 March 2004.
J D Coombe and J W J Hughes-Hallett have been appointed Directors with effect from 1 March 2005.
Having been appointed since the Annual General Meeting in 2004, they will retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and offer themselves for re-election.
W F Aldinger is to retire as a Director on 29 April 2005.
Sir John Bond, R K F Chien, Baroness Dunn, D G Eldon, D J Flint, Sir Brian Moffat, S W Newton and H Sohmen will retire by rotation at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
With the exception of D G Eldon, who is to retire, they will offer themselves for re-election.
The Board has undertaken an evaluation of its performance and that of its committees.
This evaluation covered board structure: dynamics: capabilities and processes: corporate governance: strategic clarity and alignment: and the performance of individual Directors.
In undertaking this review the Group Chairman held structured meetings with each Director using a similar framework to that employed by MWM Consulting, who prepared an independent performance evaluation of the Board and its committees in January 2004.
The report on the evaluation of the Board and its committees has been reviewed by the Board and has been used by the non-executive Directors, led by Sir Brian Moffat, in their evaluation of the performance of the Group Chairman.
The Group Audit Committee, the Remuneration Committee, the Nomination Committee and the Corporate Social Responsibility Committee have also each undertaken a review of their terms of reference and their own effectiveness during 2004.
Following this review, the Group Chairman has confirmed that the Directors standing for re-election at the Annual General Meeting continue to perform effectively and to demonstrate commitment to their roles.
It is the intention of the Board of HSBC Holdings to continue to review its performance and that of its Directors annually.

On behalf of the Board R G Barber, Secretary 28 February 2005 47 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report Summary Financial Statement Remuneration Committee The Remuneration Committee meets regularly to consider human resource issues, particularly terms and conditions of employment, remuneration, retirement benets, development of high potential employees and key succession planning.
The Remuneration Committee seeks to respond to the variety of environments and circumstances which are faced by different businesses in different markets at different times and has in place appropriate policies and procedures to monitor the size of potential remuneration awards.
The members of the Remuneration Committee throughout 2004 were Sir Mark Moody-Stuart Chairman, W K L Fung and Sir John Kemp-Welch.
S Hintze was appointed a member of the Committee on 30 January 2004.
There were seven meetings of the Remuneration Committee during 2004.
Sir Mark Moody-Stuart and Sir John Kemp-Welch attended all of these meetings, W K L Fung attended five meetings and S Hintze attended five of the six meetings following her appointment.
Following each meeting, the Committee reports back to the Board on its activities.
The terms of reference of the Committee are available on www.
com by selecting Investor Relations, then Corporate Governance, then Board Committees.
Towers Perrin, a rm of specialist human resources consultants, has been appointed by the Committee to provide independent advice on executive remuneration issues.
As a global rm, Towers Perrin also provides other remuneration, actuarial and retirement consulting services to various parts of HSBC.
Other than the provision of expert advice in these areas to the Remuneration Committee and to HSBC, Towers Perrin have no connection with HSBC.
Other consultants are used from time to time to validate their findings.
The Remuneration Committee also receives advice from the Group General Manager, Group Human Resources, J C S Rankin, and the Senior Executive, Group Reward Management, PMWood.
General Policy on Employees As with most businesses, HSBCs performance depends on the quality and commitment of its people.
Accordingly, the Boards stated strategy is to attract, retain and motivate the very best people.
In a business that is based on trust and relationships, HSBCs broad policy is to look for people who want to make a long-term career with the organisation since trust and relationships are built over time.
Remuneration is an important component in peoples decisions on which company to join, but it is not the only one: it is HSBCs experience that people are attracted to an organisation with good values, fairness, the potential for success and the scope to develop a broad, interesting career.
Within the authority delegated by the Board of Directors, the Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the remuneration policy of HSBC including the terms of bonus plans, share plans and other long-term incentive plans, and for agreeing the individual remuneration packages of executive Directors and other senior Group employees.
No Directors are involved in deciding their own remuneration.
The Remuneration Committee applies the following key principles: to ensure that the total remuneration package salary, bonus, long-term incentive awards and other benets is competitive in relation to comparable organisations in each of the countries or regions in which HSBC operates: to offer fair and realistic salaries with an important element of variable pay, differentiated by performance: through awards of shares and in limited circumstances, share options to recognise high performance and retain key talent: and since 1996, to follow a policy of moving progressively from dened benefit to dened contribution Group pension schemes for new employees only.
In line with these principles: employees salaries are reviewed annually in the context of individual and business performance, market practice, internal relativities and competitive market pressures.
Allowances and benets are largely determined by local market practice: employees participate in various bonus arrangements.
The level of performance-related variable pay depends upon the performance of constituent businesses and the individual concerned.
During 2004 variable bonus plans were reviewed to give greater emphasis to revenue growth whilst retaining a strong link to expense control: other key measures taken into account in determining individual bonus levels include customer relationships: full utilisation of professional skills: adherence to HSBCs ethical standards, internal controls and procedures.
Bonus ranges are reviewed in the context of prevailing market practice: and 48 HSBC has a long history of paying close attention to its customers in order to provide value for shareholders.
This has been achieved by ensuring that the interests of HSBC and its employees are aligned with those of its shareholders and that HSBCs approach to risk management serves the interests of all.
Accordingly, employees are encouraged to participate in the success they help to create, through participating in the HSBC Holdings savings-related share option plans and in local share ownership and profit-sharing arrangements.
During 2004, a comprehensive review of share-based remuneration arrangements was conducted.
This review was undertaken in light of changing business needs, taking into account HSBCs expansion in certain markets and an evolving external environment.
Approval for The HSBC Share Plan will be sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The proposed arrangements for the most senior executives of HSBC are described under Long-term incentive plan on page 51.
Shareholders and their representatives were consulted and the proposed arrangements reect feedback that has been received.
Below the senior executive level and in the context of an employees total remuneration package, the practice of awarding share options at all levels within HSBC has been reconsidered.
In future and commencing with awards to be made in 2005, restricted shares will be granted to a substantially smaller number of executives than those who previously received share options, with awards focused on those individuals who bring key talents and high levels of performance to the Group.
These awards will normally vest after three years, subject to the individual remaining in employment.
Awards of share options will only be granted in limited circumstances.
For those who will normally no longer be eligible to receive awards of shares or share options, variable bonus arrangements have been reviewed and enhanced, as appropriate, taking account of local markets.
Such changes may include an element of deferral.
To encourage greater participation in the HSBC Holdings Savings-Related Share Option Plan: International, two amendments to existing arrangements will be proposed for approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The first is the introduction of the facility to save in US dollars, Hong Kong dollars and euros as well as in pounds sterling.
The maximum savings limit of 250 per month will continue to apply but be converted to the other currencies on a consistent and appropriate date.
The second proposal is to offer individuals the choice of options over one year in addition to the existing three and five year terms.
This change will carry tax advantages in certain jurisdictions.
The impact on existing equity of granting share options which are to be satisfied by the issue of new shares is shown in diluted earnings per share on the face of the consolidated profit and loss account, with further details disclosed in Note 10 of the Notes on the Financial Statements on page 261 in the Annual Report and Accounts.
The effect on basic earnings per share of exercising all outstanding share options would be to dilute it by 0.6 per cent.
At the Annual General Meeting in 2000, shareholders approved a limit of 848,847,000 ordinary shares approximately 10 per cent of the ordinary shares then in issue which may be issued or become issuable under all employee share plans in any 10-year period.
Within this limit, not more than 5 per cent of the ordinary shares in issue from time to time approximately 560,000,000 ordinary shares at 28 February 2005 may be put under option under the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan and the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000.
In the 10-year period to 31 December 2004, less than 650 million ordinary shares had been issued or could become issuable under all employee share plans and less than 350 million ordinary shares had been issued or could become issuable under discretionary employee share plans, including the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan and the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000.
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, revised limits on the number of shares that may be issued or become issuable under employee share plans will be proposed to reect the increase in share capital since 2000.
Directors and Senior Management HSBCs operations are substantial, diverse and international: for example, over 73 per cent of profit before tax is derived from outside the United Kingdom.
With effect from 1 March 2005, the HSBC Holdings Board will comprise 15 non-executive Directors and seven executive Directors.
With businesses in 77 countries and territories, HSBC aims to attract Directors with a variety of experience, both in its key areas of activity and internationally.
The Board currently includes nationals of five different countries.
The seven executive Directors, four Group Managing Directors and 23 Group General Managers have in total more than 793 years of service with HSBC.
49 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement Directors fees Directors fees are regularly reviewed and compared with other large international companies.
The current fee, which was approved by shareholders in 2004, is 55,000 per annum.
With effect from 1 January 2005 Sir John Bond, D J Flint, M F Geoghegan, S K Green and A W Jebson waived their rights to receive a Directors fee from HSBC Holdings: an appropriate adjustment has been made to their basic salaries which, when taken with the consequent impact on bonuses, long-term incentive awards and pension benets, will deliver a similar value to the fee that has been waived.
W F Aldinger and D G Eldon had previously elected to waive any fees payable by HSBC Holdings.
In addition, non-executive Directors receive the following fees: Chairman, Audit Committee 40,000 p. a.

Executive Directors The executive Directors are experienced executives with detailed knowledge of the financial services business in various countries.
In most cases, there has been a need to attract them from abroad to work in the United Kingdom.
Consistent with the principles applied by the Committee to employees generally, there are four key components to the executive Directors remuneration: salary: annual cash bonus: long-term incentives: and pension.
To ensure that the executive Directors remuneration packages are competitive having regard to the broad international nature of the Group, each year the Remuneration Committee considers market data on senior executive remuneration arrangements within primarily: European banks with significant domestic and or global operations inuences: these banks include Barclays PLC, Standard Chartered PLC, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, ABN AMRO Holding N. V. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S. A. Banco Santander Central Hispano, S. A. BNP PARIBAS S. A. Commerzbank AG and Deutsche Bank AG: and other global UK-based organisations with significant exposure to US markets and competitors, including BP p. l. c. Diageo plc, GlaxoSmithKline plc, Unilever PLC and Vodafone Group plc.
The level of awards available to the executive Directors under the annual cash bonus scheme and as Performance Shares is entirely dependent on performance.
Remuneration policy for executive Directors is intended to provide competitive rates of base salary but with the potential for the majority of the value of the remuneration package to be delivered in the form of both short and long-term incentives.
This typically results in base salary comprising around 30 per cent of total direct pay and the remaining 70 per cent split between annual bonus and the expected value of Performance Share awards.
The remuneration package of W F Aldinger has a smaller proportion of xed salary and a higher proportion of annual bonus and Restricted Share awards.
The awards are in accordance with the minimum level 50 of awards set out under his employment agreement entered into on 14 November 2002 at the time of the acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation the 2002 employment agreement.
It was noted by the Committee that the three-year term, and certain other terms, of the 2002 employment agreement represented an exception to HSBCs normal policy for executive Directors service contracts, but that the background and reasons for this were explained in detail at the time of the acquisition and that the terms of the 2002 employment agreement were consistent with practice in the United States.
Since 31 December 2004, the Remuneration Committee has reviewed the financial and other terms proposed in connection with W F Aldingers retirement on 29 April 2005 which are reected in the amendment agreement dated 26 February 2005 between HSBC Finance Corporation and Mr Aldinger, details of which are summarised below.
The Committee, having reviewed the relevant factors and circumstances, considered that these financial and other terms were appropriate and in order and in the best interests of the Group.
Each component of executive Directors remuneration is explained in detail below.
Salary The Committee reviews salary levels for executive Directors each year in the same context as other employees.
With reference to market practice and taking account of the international nature of the Group, the Committee benchmarks the salary of each Director and member of Senior Management against those of comparable executives in large, diverse companies.
Base salaries with effect from January 2005 will be: W F Aldinger US$1,000,000 M F Geoghegan 632,500 Sir John Bond 1,276,300 S K Green 770,000 D G Eldon US$425,503 A W Jebson 535,000 D J Flint 500,000 Excluding the effect of adjustments to salaries following the waivers by Sir John Bond, D J Flint, M F Geoghegan, S K Green and A W Jebson of their HSBC Holdings Directors fee, this represents an average increase from 2004 of 5.02 per cent.
As an International Manager, D G Eldons current base salary, shown above, is calculated on a net basis.
Annual cash bonus Cash bonuses for executive Directors are based on two key factors: individual performance, taking into account, as appropriate, results against plan of the business unit or performance of the support function for which the individual is responsible: and Group performance, measured by comparing operating profit before tax with plan.
The Remuneration Committee has discretion to eliminate extraordinary items when assessing bonuses, if the main cause did not arise during the current bonus year.
Measurement against these key performance factors may result in discretionary cash bonuses of up to 250 per cent of basic salary for executive Directors.
Long-term incentive plan Long-term incentive plans are designed to reward the delivery of sustained financial growth of HSBC.
So as to align the interests of the Directors and senior employees more closely with those of shareholders, the vesting of Performance Share awards is subject to the attainment of predetermined performance criteria.
The Remuneration Committee has generally provided, on a discretionary basis and reective of individual performance, long-term share incentives to executive Directors and members of Senior Management through conditional awards of Performance Shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000, rather than through the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan.
As part of a comprehensive review of share-based remuneration, the Remuneration Committee considered whether the continued use of Performance Shares was appropriate.
The Committee considered several other types of arrangement but concluded that Performance Shares remain the most appropriate vehicle for HSBCs executive Directors and Senior Management.
However, the Committee recognised that there were a number of aspects to the current plan that could be improved to ensure the plan encouraged and rewarded growth and outperformance.
Accordingly, the adoption of The HSBC Share Plan, to replace the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 and the HSBC Holdings Group Share Option Plan, will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
For executive Directors and members of Senior Management The HSBC Share Plan will: 51 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement introduce absolute growth in earnings per share as a performance measure in addition to relative Total Shareholder Return: and require higher levels of performance for full vesting of the conditional awards.
The effect of these proposals is that the vesting of Performance Share awards will be more challenging and highly geared to performance than under the previous arrangements.
To maintain the same approximate expected value which takes into account factors such as the probability of vesting and risk of forfeiture for early departure of Performance Share awards under The HSBC Share Plan as previously made under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000, the face value of conditional awards under The HSBC Share Plan will be greater as shown under 2005 Awards below than those previously made under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000.
It is proposed that awards under The HSBC Share Plan will be up to a maximum of seven times salary.
Whilst having exibility to make awards at this level in certain exceptional circumstances, the Remuneration Committee does not intend seven times salary to be the normal level of award.
The average face value of the awards proposed for executive Directors is just over three times base salary: proposed individual awards are set out in the table below.
Awards proposed for 2005 for Group Managing Directors and Group General Managers will generally be below two times salary.
Further details of the performance conditions and vesting arrangements for The HSBC Share Plan are set out below.
A summary of the arrangements relevant to previous awards of Performance Shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 is also given.
Subject to approval at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, all future awards of Performance Shares, including the 2005 awards, will be made under The HSBC Share Plan.
2005 Awards The Remuneration Committee is proposing that the conditional awards shown in the table below should be made to executive Directors in 2005.
The table shows the face value of the full conditional awards and their approximate expected value.
Face value Expected value 000 000 Sir John Bond 4,000 1,760 D J Flint 1,500 660 M F Geoghegan 2,000 880 S K Green 2,500 1,100 A W Jebson 1,415 622 Total 11,415 5,022 As set out above, the higher face value of these awards than in previous years is balanced by the signicantly more challenging vesting schedule of The HSBC Share Plan where maximum value will only be released to the individual if Group performance is at a very high level.
The Trustee to the Plan will be provided with funds to acquire HSBC Holdings ordinary shares at an appropriate time after the announcement of the annual results.
Under the terms of the 2002 employment agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation, W F Aldinger is entitled to receive an award of US$5.5 million which was to be used to purchase Restricted Shares in HSBC Holdings.
However, as referred to below, Mr Aldinger is to retire on 29 April 2005 and it has been agreed that this award will not be made.
C F W fide Croisset and W R P Dalton, who retired during 2004, did not receive a long-term incentive award in 2004.
D G Eldon, who is to retire at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, will not receive a long-term incentive award in 2005.
Performance conditions Subject to approval of The HSBC Share Plan at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, awards of Performance Shares, commencing in 2005, will be divided into two equal parts to be subject to separate performance conditions measured over a three-year performance period: The Total Shareholder Return TSR award: one half of the award will be subject to a relative TSR measure.
TSR is dened as the growth in share value and declared dividend income, measured in sterling, during the relevant period.
In calculating TSR, dividend income is assumed to be reinvested in the underlying shares: and The earnings per share EPS award: the other half of the award will be based upon the absolute growth in EPS achieved by HSBC Holdings over the three-year performance period.
52 The TSR element of the award will be based on HSBCs ranking against a comparator group of 28 major banks.
The comparator group will generally comprise the largest banks in the world measured in terms of market capitalisation, having regard to the geographic spread and the nature of the activities of each bank.
The Remuneration Committee will use this criteria in selecting any replacements to the comparator group that may be necessary during the performance period, for example because a bank ceases to exist or to be quoted or if its relevance to HSBC as a comparator signicantly diminishes.
The comparator group at 28 February 2005 comprises ABN AMRO Holding N. V. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria S. A. Banco Santander Central Hispano S. A.
Bank of America Corporation, The Bank of New York Company, Inc. Barclays PLC, BNP PARIBAS S. A. Citigroup Inc. Credit Agricole S. A.
Credit Suisse Group, Deutsche Bank AG, HBOS plc, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Lloyds TSB Group plc, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group, Inc. Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. Morgan Stanley, National Australia Bank Limited, Royal Bank of Canada, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Socit Gnrale, Standard Chartered PLC, UBS AG, UniCredito Italiano Bank plc, US Bancorp, Wachovia Corporation, Wells Fargo & Company and Westpac Banking Corporation.
The extent to which awards will vest will be determined by reference to HSBC Holdings TSR measured against the comparator TSR.
The calculation of the share price component within HSBC Holdings TSR will be the average market price over the 20 trading days commencing on the day when the annual results are announced, which in 2005 is 28 February.
The starting point will be, therefore, the average over the period 28 February to 29 March inclusive.
TSR for the comparator group constituents will be calculated on the same basis.
For TSR performance in line with the bank ranked 14th, only 30 per cent of the conditional award will vest: if HSBCs performance is in line with or above the bank ranked 7th in the ranked list, all of the TSR award shares will vest.
Vesting between the 14th and 7th ranked banks will be based on HSBCs position against the ranked list.
In simple terms, the percentage vesting will rise in 10 per cent increments for each position that HSBC achieves higher than the 14th bank in the ranked list until full vesting is achieved for TSR performance equal to or greater than the 7th bank in the ranked list.
Where HSBCs performance falls between these incremental steps, account will be taken of how far above or below the next ranked bank HSBCs TSR performance is positioned.
For example, if HSBCs TSR falls half way between the bank ranked 12th where, a release of 50 per cent of the award would occur and the bank ranked 13th where a release of 40 per cent of the award would occur, then the actual award released would be 45 per cent, i. e. half way between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.
For the EPS element of the award, the base measure shall be EPS for the financial year preceding that in which the award is made the base year.
Absolute growth in EPS will then be compared with the base year over three consecutive financial years commencing with the year in which the award is made.
The EPS growth element will be the absolute level of EPS achieved during the three-year performance period.
For this purpose, EPS means the profit attributable to the shareholders expressed in US dollars, excluding goodwill amortisation, divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and held outside the Group during the year in question.
In the event that the 2004 published EPS is restated to adjust for accounting standards changes during the performance period, the restated published EPS will be used for the EPS performance condition for awards made in 2005 under The HSBC Share Plan.
The percentage of the conditional award vesting will depend upon the absolute growth in EPS achieved over the three years the performance period.
30 per cent of the conditional shares will vest if the incremental EPS over the performance period is 24 per cent or more of EPS in the base year.
The percentage of shares vesting will rise on a straight line proportionate basis to 100 per cent if HSBCs incremental EPS over the performance period is 52 per cent or more of EPS in the base year.
No element of the TSR award will vest if HSBCs performance is below that of the bank ranked 14th in the ranked list and no element of the EPS award will vest if HSBCs incremental EPS over the performance period is less than 24 per cent of EPS achieved in the base year.
To the extent that the performance conditions have not been met at the third anniversary, the shares will be forfeited.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that HSBC Holdingsnancial performance has shown a sustained improvement in the period since the date of grant.
In determining whether HSBC has achieved a sustained improvement in performance the Remuneration Committee will take account of, among other factors, the comparison against history and the peer group in the following areas: 1. revenue growth: 2. revenue mix: 53 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement 3. cost efficiency: 4. credit performance as measured by risk-adjusted revenues: and 5. cash return on cash invested, dividend performance and total shareholder return.
Following the three-year performance period, awards of Performance Shares under The HSBC Share Plan will be tested and vesting will take place shortly afterwards.
Where events occur which cause the Remuneration Committee to consider that the performance condition has become unfair or impractical, the right is reserved to the Remuneration Committee to make such adjustments as in its absolute discretion it deems appropriate to make.
Awards will vest immediately in cases of death.
In the event of redundancy, retirement on grounds of injury or ill health, early retirement, normal retirement and where a participant ceases to be employed by HSBC due to a company ceasing to be part of HSBC, awards will normally vest at the end of the vesting period on a time-apportioned basis to the extent that performance conditions have been satisfied.
Awards will normally be forfeited if the participant is dismissed or resigns from HSBC.
In all of these circumstances the Committee retains discretion to ensure fair and reasonable treatment.
Arrangements from 1999-2004 From 1999 to 2004, the vesting of awards was linked to the attainment of predetermined TSR targets over a three-year period from date of grant as set out below.
The TSR performance condition for awards of Performance Shares remained the same from 1999 to 2003.
For awards made in 2004, changes were made to the peer group and re-testing provisions were eliminated such that awards will lapse if the performance condition is not satisfied after the initial three-year performance period.
A benchmark for HSBC Holdings TSR, weighted by market capitalisation, was established which takes account of the TSR performance of: 1. a peer group of nine banks weighted by market capitalisation which were considered most relevant to HSBC in terms of size and international scope.
For performance periods up to and including the one beginning in 2003, this group comprised ABN AMRO Holding N. V. The Bank of East Asia, Limited, Citigroup Inc. Deutsche Bank AG, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Lloyds TSB Group plc, Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited and Standard Chartered PLC.
To be more relevant to HSBC in terms of size and international scope, this peer group was amended for conditional awards made in 2004 and onwards by the replacement of Lloyds TSB Group plc, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. Mitsubishi Tokyo Financial Group Inc. and The Bank of East Asia, Limited with Bank of America Corporation, The Royal Bank of Scotland Group plc, Banco Santander Central Hispano S. A. and UBS AG: 2. the five largest banks from each of the US, the UK, continental Europe and the Far East, other than any within paragraph 1 above, weighted by market capitalisation: and 3. the banking sector of the Morgan Stanley Capital International World Index, excluding any within paragraph 1 and paragraph 2 above, weighted by market capitalisation.
By combining the weighted average TSR for each of the above three groups and weighting that average so that 50 per cent is applied to paragraph 1, 25 per cent is applied to paragraph 2 and 25 per cent is applied to paragraph 3, a single TSR benchmark for market comparison was determined.
The extent to which each award will vest will be determined by reference to HSBC Holdings TSR measured against the TSR benchmark.
For each award, the calculation of the share price component within HSBC Holdings TSR was the average market price over the 20 trading days commencing on the day when the annual results were announced.
TSR for the benchmark constituents was based on their published share prices on the 20th trading day after the annual results were announced.
If HSBC Holdings TSR over the performance period exceeds the benchmark TSR, awards with a value, at the date of grant, of up to 100 per cent of the individuals earnings, will vest.
For higher value awards, the greater of 50 per cent of the award or the number of shares equating at the date of grant to 100 per cent of the individuals earnings base salary and bonus in respect of the previous performance year, will vest at this level of performance.
If HSBC Holdings TSR over the performance period places it within the upper quartile in the ranked list against the benchmark, these higher value awards will vest in full.
For performance between the median and the upper quartile, vesting will be on a straight-line basis.
54 For awards made in 2004, if the upper quartile performance target is achieved then, as before, an additional award equal to 20 per cent of the initial Performance Share award will be made and will vest at the same time as the original award to which it relates.
However, regardless of whether the upper quartile is achieved, full vesting and transfer of the shares will not generally occur until the fifth anniversary of the date of grant.
If the performance test is not passed at the third anniversary, the shares will be forfeited.
In addition to these performance conditions, none of the outstanding awards will vest unless the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that, during the performance period, HSBC has achieved a sustained improvement in performance.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to recommend early release of shares awarded in certain circumstances, for example, redundancy and ill health.
The Performance Shares awarded in 2000 passed their three-year TSR performance condition in March 2003 and will vest on the fifth anniversary of the award, 10 March 2005.
Total Shareholder Return The graphs below show HSBC Holdings TSR performance against the benchmark TSR graph 1, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange FTSE 100 Index graph 2, the Morgan Stanley Capital International MSCI World Index graph 3 and MSCI Financials Index graph 4 over the three-year period to March 2004.
These measures have been chosen as they are the main published indices against which HSBC monitors its performance.
Pursuant to the Directors Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, graph 5 shows HSBC Holdings TSR performance against a broad equity market index, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange FTSE 100 Index, for the fiveyear period ended 31 December 2004.

Service Contracts and Terms of Appointment HSBCs policy is to employ executive Directors on one-year rolling contracts although, on recruitment, longer initial terms may be approved by the Remuneration Committee.
The Remuneration Committee will, consistent with the best interests of the Group, seek to minimise termination payments.
No executive Director has a service contract with HSBC Holdings or any of its subsidiaries with a notice period in excess of one year or with provisions for predetermined compensation on termination which exceeds one years salary and benets in kind, save as referred to below.
There are no provisions for compensation upon early termination of executive Directors service contracts save for W F Aldinger, details of which are set out below.
As referred to above, Mr Aldinger entered into a new employment agreement with HSBC Finance Corporation on 14 November 2002 for a term of three years, such term to commence on the effective date of the acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation by HSBC.
Full details of the agreement were set out in the Discloseable Transaction Circular relating to the acquisition of HSBC Finance Corporation sent to shareholders on 26 February 2003 in advance of the Extraordinary General Meeting to approve the acquisition.
The effective date of the acquisition, and commencement date of the 2002 employment agreement, was 28 March 2003.
The terms of the 2002 employment agreement were amended by an agreement amendment agreement entered into between HSBC Finance Corporation and Mr Aldinger, as referred to below.
During the term of the 2002 employment agreement Mr Aldinger is entitled to be paid an annual base salary equal to his annual base salary as at the date of the merger agreement between HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC US$1 million and an annual bonus in an amount at least equal to the annual average of Mr Aldingers bonuses earned with respect to the three-year period ended 2001 pro rated for any partial year US$4 million.
Within 30 days of the effective date of the acquisition, Mr Aldinger received a one-time special retention grant of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares under the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000 with a value equal to US$10 million on terms that these Restricted Shares will vest in three equal instalments on each of the first three anniversaries of the effective date, as set out on page 64.
After each of the first and second anniversaries of the effective date, subject to the approval of the Trustee of the HSBC Holdings Restricted Share Plan 2000, Mr Aldinger is entitled to receive an additional grant of HSBC Holdings ordinary shares with a value equal to at least US$5.5 million.
The purpose of these arrangements was to retain the services of Mr Aldinger through the initial integration of HSBC Finance Corporation.
HSBC considered it essential that the experience, knowledge and skills of Mr Aldinger be retained for the benefit of HSBC shareholders.
Under the 2002 employment agreement, if Mr Aldingers employment is terminated by him during its term for good reason, or by HSBC Finance Corporation for reasons other than cause or disability, he is entitled to: a pro rata target annual bonus for the financial year of the date of termination: a payment equal to his annual base salary, plus the average of his annual bonuses with respect to the three-year period ended 2001, times the number of full and partial months from the date of termination until the third anniversary of the effective date, divided by 12: the immediate 56 31 Dec 99 31 Dec 00 31 Dec 01 31 Dec 02 31 Dec 03 31 Dec 04 vesting and exercisability of each stock option, restricted stock award and other equity-based award or performance award or cash equivalent that is outstanding as at the date of termination and treatment as retirement eligible for purposes of exercising any such award: for the remainder of his life and that of his current spouse, continued medical and dental benets at HSBC Finance Corporations cost: and his retirement benets as set out on page 60 in a lump sum.
Following discussion with Mr Aldinger, it has been agreed that Mr Aldinger will retire as Chairman and Chief Executive of HSBC Finance Corporation and HSBC North America Holdings Inc on 29 April 2005 and will retire as a director of HSBC Holdings on the same date and resign from his directorships and other appointments with Group companies.
As indicated above, the original purpose of the 2002 employment agreement was to retain the services of Mr Aldinger before the initial integration of HSBC Finance Corporation with the Groups other North American businesses.
The discussions with Mr Aldinger about his retirement before the expiry of the three-year term took into account that the integration process has now been completed successfully and faster than expected.
Under the amendment agreement, Mr Aldinger will be entitled to receive, on termination of the 2002 employment agreement on 29 April 2005, the same terms and benets summarised above as if his employment had been terminated by him for good reason or by HSBC Finance Corporation for reasons other than cause or disability, except that he will not be entitled to receive the 2005 restricted share award or cash equivalent with a value to at least US$5.5 million that he would have been entitled to receive on or before 28 April 2005.
Mr Aldinger will, however, receive a payment of US$4.6 million in lieu of salary and bonus in respect of the remainder of the three-year period.
The amendment agreement also provides that the non-competition provision in the 2002 employment agreement for a period of one year after termination of his employment, and certain other restrictions, will continue to apply.
Under this provision he may not become associated with certain competitive entities that are actively engaged in the consumer lending business including mortgage and credit card lending.

59 HSBC HOLDINGS PLC Directors Remuneration Report continued Summary Financial Statement Pensions There are separate schemes for UK-based and overseas-based employees: the UK scheme has a normal retirement age of 60: retirement ages for overseas schemes vary in accordance with local legislation and practice.
Save as stated below no other Director participated in any HSBC pension schemes, none of the Directors participating in HSBCs UK approved pension schemes is subject to the earnings cap introduced by the 1989 Finance Act and only basic salary is pensionable.
With two exceptions see paragraphs below on W F Aldinger and D J Flint, the current executive Directors are members of dened benefit pension schemes, having joined HSBC at a time when these were the norm.
Before commencement of the 2002 employment agreement on 28 March 2003, W F Aldinger participated in HSBC Finance Corporations qualied and non-qualied dened benefit pension plans.
The annual pension benefit under these arrangements was a function of service and a percentage of Final Average Earnings which included bonus.
The non-qualied plans were enhanced before commencement of the 2002 employment agreement.
The benets under the qualied and non-qualied dened benefit pension plans were then frozen and will be payable in a lump sum on the earlier of the termination of Mr Aldingers employment or on Mr Aldingers retirement these benets will be payable in a lump sum following Mr Aldingers retirement on 29 April 2005, referred to above.
No further benets have accrued under these arrangements since 28 March 2003.
Since commencement of the 2002 employment agreement on 28 March 2003, Mr Aldinger has continued to participate in the HSBC Finance Corporation Tax Reduction Investment Plan TRIP, which is a qualied funded deferred profit-sharing and savings plan for eligible employees.
Employer contributions of US$10,250 were made to this plan on behalf of Mr Aldinger in 2004 2003: nil.
On 1 January 2005, the plan name was changed to HSBC-North America U. S. Tax Reduction Investment Plan TRIP.
Mr Aldinger also participated in Supplemental TRIP a nonqualied plan, which is an unfunded arrangement under which additional employer provision of US$289,749 has been made for 2004 2003: US$41,539.
The pension arrangements for Sir John Bond, SKGreen and A W Jebson to contractual retirement age of 60 are provided under the HSBC Bank UK Pension Scheme.
The pensions accrue at a rate of one-thirtieth of pensionable salary per year of pensionable service in the UK.
Until his retirement from CCF on 29 February 2004, C F W fide Croisset was eligible for pension benets which were supplementary to those accrued under the French State and Compulsory arrangements.
The amount of this supplementary pension, payable from age 60, accrued at the rate of 6,098 per annum for each year of service maximum 18 years as an executive Director of CCF.
Consequent upon Mr fide Croissets early retirement from CCF and following a review of market practice, it was agreed to provide a total pension of 341,467 per annum equivalent to 32.5 per cent of his average total cash compensation over a three-year period payable from 1 March 2004.
In 2004, CCF paid 213,003 to Mr fide Croisset under this arrangement.
The pension arrangements for W R P Dalton to contractual retirement age of 60 were provided on a dened benefit basis details of which are set out in the table below under the HSBC Canada Pension Plan A, at an accrual rate of onethirtieth of pensionable salary per year of pensionable service until his transfer to the UK in 1998.
On taking up his appointment in the UK, he joined the HSBC Holdings Overseas No.

The pension arrangements for D J Flint to contractual retirement age of 60 are provided through an executive allowance paid to fund personal pension arrangements set at 30 per cent of basic salary.
This is supplemented through the HSBC Holdings plc Funded Unapproved Retirement Benets Scheme on a dened contribution basis with an employer contribution during 2004 of 86,013 2003: 81,943.
The intention of these arrangements is to provide 60 benets broadly comparable to an accrual rate of one-thirtieth of pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service.
The pension arrangements for D G Eldon and M F Geoghegan are provided under the HSBC International Staff Retirement Benets Scheme.
The pensions accrue at a rate of one twenty-seventh of pensionable salary per year of pensionable service.
In addition, Mr Geoghegan has joined the HSBC Asia Holdings Pension Plan, on a dened contribution basis, with an employer contribution in respect of 2004 of 1,200,000, arising entirely from a bonus sacrifice.
There were no other employer contributions made to this plan.

2 On attaining age 60, Sir John Bond has been able, under the terms of the scheme, to retire at any time with an immediate pension equal to his accrued pension which, at 31 December 2004, is shown above.
3 Retired as a Director on 27 February 2004.
4 W R P Dalton retired from HSBC with effect from 31 May 2004 with a gross pension of 277,000 per annum.
Mr Dalton elected to commute part of this pension for a lump sum payment of 4,256,000, leaving a residual pension of 13,000 per annum.
As a result the pension in payment at 31 December 2004 is lower than the accrued pension at 1 January 2004.
The increase in accrued pension during 2004 reects the gross pension before commutation.
The transfer value of benets at 31 December 2004 reects both the pension in payment and the commutation lump sum, increased with interest.
5 On attaining age 53, D G Eldon has been able, under the terms of the scheme, to retire at any time with an immediate pension equal to his accrued pension which, at 31 December 2004, is shown above.
