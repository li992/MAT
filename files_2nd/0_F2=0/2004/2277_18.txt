A proxy need not be a member.
Brief biographical details of Directors standing for re-election at the Meeting are set out on page 18.
Recommendation and explanatory notes Renewal of authority to allot shares Resolutions 7 and 8 Under the provisions of Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 the Directors are not able to allot shares except with the general or specic approval of shareholders.
A general authority was granted on 26 May 2004 in respect of the shares then unissued and it is now proposed in resolution number 7 in the notice convening the annual general meeting that this authority be renewed for a period of fifteen months from the date of passing the resolution in respect of 10,899,953 being the unissued share capital as at 20 February 2005 which represents 33.9% of the issued share capital.
No shares are held in treasury.
The Board has no present intention of issuing any further shares nor will any such issue be made which would effectively alter the control of the Company without the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting.
Sections 89 and 95 of the Companies Act 1985 provide that any ordinary shares issued for cash must first be offered to existing shareholders unless their approval is obtained that this stipulation should not be applied.
The Directors consider it desirable that they should have the authority to make allotments of ordinary shares for cash, other than by way of rights issues to existing shareholders, up to a maximum nominal value of 1,605,002 being 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 20 February 2005.
Purchase of own Shares Resolution 9 Under Article 9 the Company is empowered to purchase its own shares.
The Directors consider that the power to make purchases in the market of the Companys own shares should be maintained, and accordingly recommend the approval of the special resolution set out as resolution number 9.
The Directors intend to exercise this authority only where, in the light of market conditions prevailing at that time, they believe that the effect of such purchases would be to increase earnings per share, or to deliver shares to participants in the Bodycote International executive share option schemes.
Any shares purchased in this way will either be cancelled, in which case the number of shares in issue will be reduced accordingly, or held as treasury shares.
The resolution species the maximum and minimum prices at which shares may be bought, and the maximum number of shares which may be bought, this being 10% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital.
As at 31 December 2004 outstanding share options over unissued shares totalled 7,321,297 and this represented 2.3% of the Companys issued share capital.
If the Company utilised the authority proposed by resolution 9 in full, outstanding share options would then represent 2.5% of the consequently reduced share capital.
The Directors consider that the proposals described in this notice are in the best interests of the shareholders as a whole and unanimously recommend shareholders to vote in favour of all the resolutions proposed, as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings.
A form of proxy is enclosed for those entitled to vote.
Instructions are given for electronic proxy voting and voting by CREST.
