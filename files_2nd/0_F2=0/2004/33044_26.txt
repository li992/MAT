18 Pension Arrangements and other Post-Retirement Benefits General and SSAP24 disclosures The Group has various pension schemes throughout the world and these cover a significant proportion of the current employees.
The principal schemes are of the funded defined benefit type, with benefits accruing based on salary and length of service.
The schemes assets are held in external funds administered by trustees and managed professionally.
Regular assessments are carried out by independent actuaries and the long-term contribution rates decided on the basis of their recommendations.
Costs are normally spread as a percentage of payroll.
There are also some defined contribution type schemes with benefits based on contributions to the fund.
In the UK, US, Canada and South Africa, the Group has certain post-retirement medical benefit schemes whereby the Group contributes towards medical costs for certain retirees.
These contributions are paid only for retirees who were members of such medical schemes before retirement.
The major scheme is the Cadbury Schweppes Pension Fund in the UK for which the last full valuation was carried out as at 5 April 2002 on the projected unit method when the market value of the assets was 1,349 million.
