Notes to the Financial Statements For the Year Ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting Policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described below and have been applied consistently throughout the current and prior years, with the exception of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, which has been adopted in the year, in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
Basis of Preparation The financial statements have been prepared under merger accounting principles in relation to the merger of Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc.
Under merger accounting the results, balance sheets and cash flows of Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc are combined with effect from 1 January 2003.
The Profit and Loss Account, Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement comparatives are restated on a combined basis and adjustments are made to achieve consistency of accounting policies.
The financial years of Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc both ended on 31 December.
T&F Informa plcs financial year ended on 31 December.
These statutory accounts are for the 12 months ended 31 December 2004.
The following information is set out in Note 29: a analysis of the principal components of the current and prior financial year Profit and Loss Accounts and Statements of Total Recognised Gains and Losses between the parties to the merger up to the date of the merger and the merged entity after that date: b the Balance Sheets of each party to the merger at 30 April 2004 being the nearest practicable date to the actual date of the merger: and c the nature and the amount of accounting alignments made to achieve consistency in accounting policies.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are included in the consolidated financial statements under the acquisition method from the date control passes.
Joint ventures are accounted for in accordance with the gross equity method.
The accounting treatment for the merger of Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc is set out above under Basis of Preparation.
Turnover Turnover represents the amount receivable excluding sales taxes, for products and services supplied to customers and is stated after deduction of trade discounts and provisions for returns and cancellations.
Subscription income is deferred and recognised over the period of the subscription.
Conference income is deferred and recognised when the conference is held.
Income from managed events represents fees earned and is recognised when the event is held.
Intangible Fixed Assets Publishing goodwill, comprising intellectual property rights on individual titles acquired, is valued at cost less provision for impairment and is written off on a straight line basis over estimated life, which is between 3 and 20 years.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary companies and businesses is calculated as the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is then written off on a straight-line basis over the estimated life, which is between 3 and 20 years.
In the opinion of the Directors this is an appropriate basis given the nature of the markets and customer base served.
The Board carries out a full impairment review on each acquired subsidiary or business after the first full year following its acquisition or where a change in circumstances warrants a further review.
Tangible Fixed Assets Tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets in equal instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
The rates of depreciation are as follows: Freehold property 50-100 years Short leasehold properties and improvements over life of the lease Equipment, fixtures and fittings 3-15 years Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Investments held by the Company in subsidiaries and joint ventures denominated in foreign currencies are translated at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Deferred conference costs represent costs incurred for conferences planned to be held after the balance sheet date.
Deferred promotional expenditure Promotional expenditure incurred during the year is matched against revenue generated by that expenditure.
Deferred promotional expenditure included in the balance sheet represents promotional expenditure incurred during the year in respect of revenue which is expected to arise after the balance sheet date.
T&F Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 39 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting Policies continued Foreign Currencies Unhedged monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange ruling in the period in which amounts are transacted, unless matching forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into, in which case the rate specified in the relevant contract is used.
These translation differences are dealt with in the Profit and Loss Account.
The financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange and the differences arising from the translation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries at the closing rate and matched long-term foreign currency borrowings are taken directly to reserves.
Leased Assets Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the lease and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
Operating lease rentals are charged to Profit and Loss Account in equal annual amounts over the lease term.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains or losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a nondiscounted basis.
Pension Costs Certain Group companies operate defined contribution pension schemes for employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from the individual companies.
The pension cost charge associated with these schemes represents contributions payable.
The Group also operates funded defined benefit schemes for employees.
The expected cost of pensions of the defined benefit pension schemes is charged to the Profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees in the schemes.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the schemes.
The pension cost associated with the schemes is treated in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Financial Instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All derivative instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Forward contracts for the purchase and or sale of foreign currencies are used to manage the Groups exposure to fluctuations in currency rates.
Unrealised gains and losses on such contracts are accounted for on maturity of the contract.
Where a forward currency contract no longer represents a hedge it is restated to fair value and any gain or loss is taken to the Profit and Loss Account.
Termination payments are taken to the Profit and Loss Account as incurred.
Finance Costs Finance costs of debts are recognised in the Profit and Loss Account at a constant rate on the carrying amount over the life of the debt.
Own Shares Own shares deducted in arriving at shareholders funds represent the cost of the Companys ordinary shares acquired by Employee Share Option Plan ESOP trusts in connection with the Groups employee share schemes.
The accounting policies for own shares held in ESOP trusts have been amended to conform to UITF 38.

9 Earnings per Share Basic The basic earnings per share calculations are based on a profit on ordinary activities after taxation and minority interests of 126,000 2003: 16,349,000.
This profit on ordinary activities after taxation is then divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue less those nonvested shares held by employee share ownership trusts, which is 296,971,000 2003: 276,493,000.
Diluted The diluted earnings per share calculation is based on the basic earnings per share calculation above except that the weighted average number of shares includes all dilutive options granted by the balance sheet date as if those options had been exercised on the first day of the accounting period or the date of the grant, if later, giving a weighted average of 298,757,000 2003: 277,604,000.
In accordance with FRS 14 the weighted average number of shares includes the estimated maximum number of shares payable to the vendors of Routledge Publishing Holdings Limited assuming that there are no claims for compensation by the Group that will reduce this deferred consideration and assuming that the Company does not exercise its option to pay the balance of deferred consideration in cash.
The deferred consideration shares are also assumed for the purposes of this calculation to have been issued on 1 January 2004 at the closing mid-market share price on 31 December 2004 of 377.5p, making 336,000 2003: 423,000 ordinary shares that could potentially be issued.

These assets have not been recognised in the financial statements as in the opinion of the Directors there is insufficient evidence that they will be recoverable.
These assets may become recoverable if trading entities to which the tax losses relate realise taxable profits.
Deferred tax assets recognised relate mainly to tax deductible expenses for which relief has yet to be obtained.
It is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of these underlying timing differences can be deducted.

i Accounting Policy Alignment Certain adjustments have been made and reflected in the results of the Group, to align the accounting policies previously adopted by Informa Group plc and Taylor & Francis Group plc.
The adjustments are in respect of the treatment of deferred costs and the re-translation of deferred income.
Previously deferred costs have now been written off, resulting in a reduction in other debtors of 1,066,000 at 31 December 2003 and an increase in other operating costs before goodwill amortisation of 555,000 for the year ended 31 December 2003.
An amount of 511,000 was treated as if never capitalised and therefore expensed to the Profit and Loss Account prior to 1 January 2003.
Deferred income held in foreign currencies, which was previously re-translated at year end, has been recorded at the historic rate.
This resulted in an increase in deferred income at 31 December 2003 of 728,000 and an increase in deferred income at 31 December 2004 of 1,400,000.
The impact on the balance sheet at 1 January 2003 was not material.

The Groups activities expose it mainly to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates.
The Group mainly uses foreign exchange forward and spot contracts and interest rate swap contracts to hedge these exposures.
All external hedging is performed by the Group Treasury Function.
Group Treasury acts as a service centre operating under the clearly defined regulation of the Board.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Funding and deposit management The Group primarily borrows at short-term variable rates under its multi-currency revolving credit facilities.
On the merger in May 2004 the Group entered into a new five-year 440 million multi-currency term loan and revolving credit facility.
The existing facilities of both Taylor & Francis and Informa were cancelled at the same time.
In addition, during 2001, the Group raised USD50 million on the US private placement market, due in seven equal annual instalments from 2005 to 2011.
Short-term flexibility is also achieved through the use of overdraft facilities and cash pooling arrangements are in place in GBP, EUR and USD to maximise the interest receivable on surplus working capital.
The Group monitors the distribution of its cash assets, borrowings and facilities so as to control exposure to the relative performance of any particular territory, currency or institution.
Cash Flows Historically and for the foreseeable future the Group has been and will continue to be in a net borrowing position.
The Groups policy is to fulfil its borrowing requirements by borrowing in the currencies in which it operates and generates surplus cash inflows, principally GBP, USD and EUR: thereby providing a natural hedge against future surplus cash inflows in those currencies as well as spreading the Groups interest rate profile across a number of currencies.
For so long as the Group is in a net borrowing position, in order to maintain the spread of the Groups interest rate profile and to retain a degree of flexibility, minimum levels of USD and EUR denominated debt will be maintained.
Accordingly surplus foreign currency denominated cash inflows will be used first to repay outstanding borrowings in those currencies, up to the pre-determined minimum foreign currency denominated debt levels.
Thereafter the minimum foreign currency denominated debt levels will be maintained by selling, for GBP, up to USD75 million of the Groups consolidated USD denominated sales and up to EUR25 million of its consolidated EUR denominated annual sales, once the receipt of the associated USD and EUR cash inflows can be forecast with reasonable certainty.
T&F Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 59 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2004 30 Financial Instruments continued Balance Sheet Allied to the Groups above policy on the hedging of surplus foreign currency cash inflows, the Group will usually seek to finance its net investment in its principal overseas subsidiaries by borrowing in those subsidiaries functional currencies.
This policy will have the effect of protecting the Groups consolidated balance sheet from movements in those currencies to the extent that the associated net assets exceed the net foreign currency borrowings.
Interest Rates The Group seeks to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates by using interest rate swaps to hedge up to 75% of the Groups forecast interest payments over the unexpired period of its existing loan instruments, based on forecast net debt levels by currency during that period.
This policy provides a level of certainty of future interest costs which in turn assists the predictability of achieving interest-based loan covenants.

T&F Informa plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 63 Notes to the Financial Statements continued For the Year Ended 31 December 2004 31 Pension Schemes As explained in the accounting policies set out on page 40, in the UK the Group operates pension schemes for qualifying UK employees providing benefits based on final pensionable pay the Schemes.
The assets of the Schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to the Schemes are charged to the Profit and Loss Account so as to spread the cost of contributions over employees working lives with the Group.
Contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the attained age method to reflect the fact that the Schemes are closed to new entrants.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Informa Final Salary Scheme was at 31 March 2002 and does not take into account the impact of any changes in asset value since that date.
Any such impact will be reflected in the next valuation.
Employees who are members contribute 10% of pensionable pay: the Groups contribution over the year was 18.9% of pensionable pay.
The market value of the schemes assets as at 31 March 2002 was 16,944,000, which represented 76% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The assumptions adopted are: Rate of return on investments after retirement 5.5% pa Rate of return on investments before retirement 6.5% pa Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.7% pa Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% pa The most recent actuarial valuation of the Taylor & Francis Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme was at 30 September 2002 and does not take into account the impact of any changes in asset values since that date.
Employees who are members contribute 3% of pensionable pay: the Groups contribution over the year was 33.6% of pensionable pay.
The market value of the schemes assets as at 30 September 2002 was 4,271,000, which represented 63% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions adopted are: Rate of return on investments 9.0% pa Rate of increase in pensions in payment 4.5% pa Rate of increase in salaries 6.5% pa Rate of dividend growth 5.0% pa The pension charge for the schemes for the period was 1,755,000 2003: 1,258,000.
This included 622,000 in respect of the amortisation of the Schemes deficits over the average remaining service lifetimes of active members.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution schemes.
Contributions during the year under these schemes were 3,249,000, 2003: 2,621,000.
