"The system set-up charge is calculated on a discounted cashflow basis, as set out further in Oftel's Determination of 22 February 2002, ""Final Determination of Surcharges for the Provision by BT of Carrier Pre Selection Facilities""."
The charge will apply to each relevant minute of traffic over the period in which there is an unrecovered amount of cost, starting from 1 April 2002.
Based on forecast minute volumes, it is expected that the recovery period will be 5 years.
A volume of 976,269 million minutes will be required to recover the cost.
As at 31 March 2004, a cumulative total of 36m had been recovered 2002 03 - 18m, against relevant cumulative minutes of 328,771mm.
There is a timing difference between the recognition of the operating expenditure, which is written off as incurred in the profit and loss account, and of that portion of the charge which is recovering those costs over the 5 year period.
