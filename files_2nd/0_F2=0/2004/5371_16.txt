From 1998, FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible fixed assets was implemented which required purchased goodwill and other intangible fixed assets to be capitalised and amortised through the Consolidated profit and loss account.
Intangible fixed assets for 1997 and earlier have been restated to include purchased goodwill previously written off.
FRS 19 Deferred tax was adopted in 2002.
No restatement of prior year figures was required.
A definition of normalised is provided in Note 1 c and on the face of the profit and loss account.
In 2002 this definition was amended to include digital activities.
Prior year figures have been restated accordingly.
In calculating Operating profits into cash, operating cash flow net of capital expenditure is adjusted to exclude expenditure against non normalised transactions or events such as exceptional reorganisation provisions and compared to normalised Group operating profit.
Per share information has been adjusted for scrip issues and the bonus effect of the 1992, 1994 and 1999 rights issues.
Dividend cover is based on normalised profit attributable to shareholders.
