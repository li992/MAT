Notes to the consolidated financial statements 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies A summary of the principal accounting policies, all of which have been applied consistently throughout the periods are set out below.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the dates indicated in the primary financial statements.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
The combination of Cambridge Silicon Radio Limited and CSR plc formerly Cambridge Silicon Radio Holdings Limited has been accounted for as a merger in accordance with the group reconstruction provisions of Financial Reporting Standard No.
Consequently, although CSR plc was not incorporated until 26 March 2001, the Group financial statements are presented as if the companies had always been part of the same Group.
Other acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
c Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
No depreciation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
On other fixed assets depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Computer hardware and test equipment 2 to 5 years Software licences 3 to 5 years Office equipment 3 years Furniture and fittings 5 years Leasehold improvements Minimum lease period Residual value is calculated based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
d Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
Short term investments represent amounts on deposit with banks.
e Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
f Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only to the extent that, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Neither is deferred tax recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
42 Changing the way the world connects Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies continued g Turnover Turnover represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of trade discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Turnover is recognised upon shipment of goods.
Royalty income is recognised upon shipment of the royalty earning product by the licensee.
Turnover is shown net of estimated provision for credit notes and returns.
h Pension costs The Group contributes to a contracted-in money purchase pension scheme CIMP where the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs is the contributions payable in the period.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
i Foreign currency The functional currency of the Group is the US dollar.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the contracted rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date or, if appropriate, at the forward contract rate.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets, and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are dealt with through the reserves.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
j Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
k Research and development Research and development expenditure is written off as incurred.
l Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups financial statements.
m Share related charges In accordance with UITF 17, the Group recognises a charge on shares or share options issued at below fair value, equal to the differential between the fair value and the exercise price of the option or purchase price of shares.
The Group has taken advantage of the exemption contained in UITF 17 and no charge is recognised on share options issued under SAYE schemes.

This adjustment has increased the level of trading losses within the Group which are available for utilisation against future taxable profits.
This benefit has been recognised as part of the deferred tax asset.
