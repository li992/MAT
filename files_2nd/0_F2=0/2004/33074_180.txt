For the calculation of combined ordinary capital, the exchange rate of 1 Fl.
12 5.445 has been used, in accordance with the Equalisation Agreement.
Earnings per share before exceptional items and amortisation of goodwill and intangible assets is provided in this Annual Report and Accounts because the Directors believe it better explains the ongoing trends in the Groups performance during the duration of the Path to Growth programme.
This measure is an important component of the targets on which Directors annual performance bonuses are based.
United Kingdom Financial Reporting Standard 14 requires the company to provide a reconciliation of earnings in the notes to the accounts in these circumstances.
The calculations of diluted earnings per share are based on i conversion into PLC ordinary shares of the shares in a group company which are convertible in the year 2038 as described in Corporate governance on page 66, ii conversion of the 0.05 NV preference shares, details of which are set out in note 22 on page 132 and iii the exercise of share options, details of which are set out in note 30 on pages 138 to 147.
On 15 February 2005 we converted the 0.05 NV preference shares into ordinary 0.51 NV shares.
The conversion was made using shares already held by the company for the purposes of hedging the Groups employee share option plans.
NV will buy further ordinary shares in the market during 2005 to the extent required to restore the hedging position.
In 2004, the 0.05 preference shares were potentially dilutive for the purposes of the calculation of fully diluted earnings per share, as shown below.
