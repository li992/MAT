Statement of accounting policies The following are the principal accounting policies which have been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, with the exception of the groups accounting policy for own shares see below.
Change in accounting policy The group has adopted Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 effective from 1 January 2004.
UITF 38 requires the consideration paid by Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP trusts to acquire own shares to be deducted from shareholders funds and that no gain or loss should be recognised on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the companys own shares.
Previously, own shares held by ESOP trusts were classified as a fixed asset investment.
Their carrying value was reviewed periodically for impairment and any impairment losses were recorded in the profit and loss account.
Own shares held by ESOP trusts with a book value at 1 January 2004 of 18.7 million have been reclassified from fixed asset investments to shareholders funds, resulting in a corresponding reduction in the groups net assets.
Comparative figures in the balance sheet and related notes have been restated.
There was no material impact on the groups profit and loss account in either the current or previous year.
The group has also adopted the revised UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes UITF 17 Revised from 1 January 2004.
UITF 17 Revised requires the profit and loss account charge for share options to be determined using an options intrinsic value on the date of grant.
Previously, the charge was based on intrinsic value or, where shares were purchased by an ESOP trust, by reference to the cost of shares less any amounts payable by employees on exercise of an option.
Implementation of this standard has not materially affected the groups profit and loss account or balance sheet in either the current or previous year.
Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements include those of LogicaCMG plc the company and all its subsidiary undertakings together the group drawn up to 31 December 2004.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
In the groups financial statements, investments in joint ventures have been accounted for using the equity method as the separate assets and liabilities are not material to the group.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the groups shares of joint ventures results, while the groups share of the net assets of joint ventures is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses representing any excess of fair value of consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life.
The useful economic lives do not exceed 20 years and are the periods over which the directors estimate that the value of the underlying businesses are expected to exceed the value of the underlying net assets in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 January 1998 remains written off to the profit and loss account reserve, or other reserve where appropriate, as permitted by FRS 10.
The unamortised balance of goodwill is reviewed regularly and, if an impairment has occurred, is written down to its recoverable amount.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost.
Depreciation is provided at rates to write off the cost of the fixed assets down to their residual value over their expected useful lives on a straight-line basis at the following rates: Furniture 10-20% Computer rooms 20% Partitions and office equipment 10-20% Computers 25-33% Freehold property 2% Motor vehicles 25% Leasehold equipment and plant Over life of lease Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less any write down for impairment.
Stock Stock represents computer equipment that, at the balance sheet date, has not yet been allocated to a specific customer contract.
Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Financial statements 57 LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2004 1.
Statement of accounting policies continued Leases Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets have passed to the group, and hire purchase contracts, are capitalised in the balance sheet at the present value of minimum lease payments payable during the lease term and are depreciated over their useful lives.
The capital element of future obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts is included within liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest element of the rental obligation is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases and hire purchase contracts and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Taxation Corporation tax is payable on taxable profits at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, under the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised to take account of timing differences between the treatment of transactions for financial reporting purposes and their treatment for tax purposes.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, if hedged, at the rate of exchange under the related forward exchange contract.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates prevailing at that date or, if hedged, at the forward contract rate.
Trading results of foreign subsidiaries are included in the groups results using average exchange rates.
Gains and losses arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment in foreign subsidiaries and the results of foreign subsidiaries at the year-end rate are taken directly to reserves.
Gains and losses arising on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the groups investments in such operations, are also taken directly to reserves.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in the profit and loss account.
The most important foreign currency for the group is the euro.
The relevant exchange rates for translation to pounds sterling were: 2004 2003 Average Closing Average Closing 1 1.47 1.41 1.45 1.42 The primary reporting currency of the group is pounds sterling.
The group also presents primary statements in euros, see pages 76 to 78.
Hedge accounting The group uses forward contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risks.
The group considers these financial instruments to be hedges that is, an offset of foreign exchange risk when the following criteria are met: the financial instruments must be related to a specific foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified it must involve the same currency as the hedged item it must reduce foreign currency risk on the groups operations.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are included in the carrying amount of those assets or liabilities and are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are classified as deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account or as adjustments in the carrying amount of the transaction when it occurs.
Forward contracts used to hedge the currency mix of the group have their contracted rates valued against the balance sheet rates with the net unrealised gains or losses being shown as part of the debt they are hedging.
The difference between the spot and forward rates for these contracts is recognised as net interest payable over the period of the contract.
The groups policy for financial instruments is given in note 22.
Gains or losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised as other income or expenses.
Financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2004 58 Notes to the financial statements 1.
Statement of accounting policies continued Research and development Research and development costs are written off in the period in which they are incurred unless they are to be reimbursed by third parties.
Turnover Turnover represents the fair value of work done for clients including attributable profit and after adjusting for all foreseeable future losses but excluding local sales taxes.
Turnover in respect of software product licences with no significant service obligation is recognised 100 per cent on delivery.
For other software product licences turnover is recognised on a percentage of completion basis, based on the fair value of work performed.
Where the time value of money is material, turnover is recognised as the present value of the cash inflows expected to be received from the customer in settlement.
Recognition of profits Profit on contracts for the supply of professional services at pre-determined rates is recognised as and when the work is performed, irrespective of the duration of the contract.
Profit is taken on fixed price contracts while the contract is in progress, having regard to the proportion of the total contract which has been completed at the balance sheet date and estimated costs by reference to the costs incurred to date versus total estimated costs to completion.
Provision is made for all foreseeable future losses.
Amounts recoverable on contracts Amounts recoverable on contracts represent turnover which has not yet been invoiced to clients on fixed price contracts.
Such amounts are separately disclosed within debtors.
The valuation of amounts recoverable on contracts is adjusted to take up profit to date or foreseeable losses in accordance with the accounting policy for the recognition of profits.
Other amounts recoverable on contracts are valued at the lower of cost or estimated realisable value.
Cost comprises: professional amounts recoverable valued at the cost of salaries and associated payroll expenses of employees engaged on assignments and a proportion of attributable overheads unbilled expenses incurred and equipment purchased for clients in connection with specific contracts.
Post-retirement benefits The cost of the groups defined contribution arrangements are charged against profits on the basis of the contributions payable by the group.
The costs of the groups defined benefit pension arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs on a systematic basis allowing for the expected pension costs spread over the remaining service lives of the scheme members, as calculated by the actuaries of the group.
The cost of providing non-pension post-retirement benefits is charged to the profit and loss account to spread the regular cost over the service lives of employees.
The group has continued to disclose the amounts relating to the groups defined benefit pension schemes as required under the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Employee share schemes and ESOP trusts The intrinsic value of awards to employees of shares or share options is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to which the employees performance relates.
The administration and finance costs of ESOP trusts are included in the profit and loss account.
The consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the companys own shares is shown as a movement on shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held by ESOP trusts are shown under the appropriate statutory heading.
Government grants Capital grants are treated as deferred income and credited to the profit and loss account on the same basis as the related assets are depreciated.
Revenue grants are credited to the profit and loss account in the same period as the related expenditure is charged.

During the year, operating costs were re-analysed between captions.
Prior year comparatives have been amended to reclassify other operating expenses of 75.6 million to material and other external charges to be consistent.
The reclassification has been made since the directors are of the opinion that it more accurately reflects the nature of the underlying costs.

IFRS transition fees of 0.5 million in the year ended 31 December 2004 related principally to work carried out by , in their capacity as group auditors, on the restatement of financial information under International Financial Reporting Standards.
Exceptional items In 2004, the group incurred a charge of 16.2 million relating to the restructuring of the business in Germany.
The restructuring comprised a substantial reduction in headcount together with other measures to reduce the cost base.
In addition, a restructuring charge of 1.6 million was incurred in France, on which there was a current tax credit of 0.3 million.
On 17 December 2004, the group disposed of its investment in the MiGWay messaging gateway joint venture with Teledenmark.
The disposal resulted in the receipt of 0.4 million as consideration for the transaction and a loss on disposal of 1.8 million.
There was no tax effect of the loss on disposal of the MiGWay investment.
In 2005, the group disposed of the EPPIX billing platform business.
Provision was made for the loss on disposal of 9.4 million.
The tax effect of the loss on disposal was a current tax credit of 1.4 million.
The EPPIX business has been classified as a discontinued operation since it is considered material to the wireless networks segment.
Comparative information in the group profit and loss account, and related notes, for the year ended 31 December 2003 has been restated where applicable.
In the prior year, a charge of 107.2 million was incurred relating to the restructuring programme put in place following the merger on 30 December 2002 of Logica plc and CMG plc.
The costs mainly related to redundancies and the cost of vacant properties.
A loss of 1.5 million on disposal of two businesses, Radio Planning and i2DM, was also recognised during the prior year.

In some countries, contributions are made into state pension schemes.
The pension cost charge for the year ended 31 December 2004 for defined contribution schemes amounted to 35.2 million 2003: 34.6 million.
In addition, the group also operates defined benefit pension schemes primarily for the benefit of employees in the UK and the Netherlands, with smaller defined benefit schemes in other European countries, and contributes to a life policy scheme in the US for 12 ex-employees.
Each defined benefit scheme is funded in advance by contributions from the employing companies, and in some cases also employees, to meet the costs, at rates assessed by the actuary or insurer of each scheme, in regular funding reviews.
The schemes assets are held in funds separate from those of the group.
The CMG schemes were closed to new members in 1994.
The Admiral scheme was closed to new members in November 2000.
The CMG UK and Admiral UK schemes merged with effect from 1 July 2002.
The combined scheme is referred to as the CMG UK pension scheme.
The Logica Netherlands scheme was closed to new entrants and for future accrual in November 1999.
Consequently no contributions were made during the years ended 31 December 2004 and 2003.
Valuation of significant defined benefit schemes The two most significant defined benefit schemes in the group are the CMG UK pension scheme and the CMG Netherlands pension scheme.
Details of their latest full actuarial valuations are provided below.
The cost of the CMG UK pension scheme was assessed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method of valuation.
The date of the latest formal valuation was 1 July 2002.
The principal assumptions used were a rate of investment return of 7.5 per cent per annum, salary increases during service of 4.0 per cent per annum and a rate of inflation of 2.5 per cent.
The market value of the schemes assets at the valuation date was 81.7 million and the funding level was 76.3 per cent on an ongoing basis.
The deficit on the scheme will be met by increased rates of contribution by the group, and employees, over the expected average remaining service lives of employees.
Following the latest formal valuation of the CMG UK pension scheme, the group's contribution rate was agreed as 15 per cent.
The scheme was 101.1 per cent funded on a current funding level basis.
Financial statements LogicaCMG plc annual report and accounts 2004 62 Notes to the financial statements 6.
Employees continued The cost of the CMG Netherlands pension scheme was assessed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method of valuation.
The date of the latest formal valuation was 1 January 2002.
The principal assumptions used were a rate of investment return of 6.0 per cent per annum and salary increases during service of 4.0 per cent per annum.
The market value of the schemes assets at the valuation date was 93.8 million.
This represented 152 per cent of the actuarial value of accrued liabilities.
The surplus is being amortised over the remaining service lives of employees and is allowed for in the pension cost.
Pension prepayments of 7.4 million at 31 December 2004 2003: 4.4 million and provisions of 0.1 million 2003: nil represent the cumulative difference between the pension cost charged to the profit and loss account each year for defined benefit schemes and pension contributions paid by group companies to defined benefit schemes.
At 31 December 2004, 7.2 million 2003: 4.4 million of the pension prepayment related to non-UK schemes and 0.2 million 2003: nil to UK schemes.
At 31 December 2004, all the 0.1 million pension provision related to UK schemes.
The pension cost charged to the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 December 2004 in respect of defined benefit schemes was 7.5 million 2003: 5.1 million.
All the groups defined benefit schemes are closed schemes and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.

Taxation continued The effective tax rate for the year and the prior year was different from the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
The differences are analysed as follows: 2004 2003 m m Profit loss on ordinary activities before tax 42.4 33.0 Goodwill amortisation 23.8 23.8 Exceptional items 29.0 108.7 Profit on ordinary activities 95.2 99.5 Tax on profit on ordinary activities at the standard rate of UK corporation tax of 30% 2003: 30% 28.6 29.9 Adjustment to current and deferred tax in respect of prior years 6.0 9.2 Adjustment in respect of foreign tax rates 3.3 5.5 Tax loss utilisation 5.8 2.5 Deferred tax assets not recognised 10.1 6.1 Other items including permanent differences 0.5 0.6 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 29.7 29.2 Tax on restructuring costs and other exceptional items 1.7 18.5 Total tax charge for the year 28.0 10.7 Before exceptional items, goodwill amortisation and tax.
Deferred tax Asset Provision Total The movement on deferred tax is as follows: m m m At 1 January 2004 8.6 6.5 2.1 Change in value due to currency fluctuations 0.1 1.4 1.3 Reclassification from current tax 28.7 28.7 Credited charged to the profit and loss account 2.5 5.1 2.6 At 31 December 2004 11.2 41.7 30.5 The reclassification relates to timing differences, with the group receiving a current tax benefit in previous periods which will be reversed in future periods.
The reclassification arises because the timing differences were not recognised in current tax due to uncertain tax treatment of the timing differences in previous periods.
The corporation tax recoverable amount in note 15 reflects this reclassification, and the reclassification has no effect on the profit and loss account.

The asset will be recoverable in the future should the group generate sufficient taxable profits against which the losses can be offset.
The most significant unrecognised deferred tax assets in the group related to Germany, 44.2 million 2003: 29.6 million, and the US, 6.0 million 2003: 7.5 million.
Tax losses carried forward at 31 December 2004 were 105.0 million and 20.4 million for Germany and the US respectively 2003: 70.4 million and 25.1 million.

In the prior year the group made a loss for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders and consequently the effects of share options and convertible bonds were anti-dilutive for the purposes of calculating unadjusted earnings per share.
Accordingly, there was no difference between the weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted loss per share.
Earnings per share from continuing operations, both basic and diluted, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, has also been included as the directors consider this figure to be helpful for a better understanding of the performance of the underlying business.

Borrowings continued In September 2003, the group issued 303.4 million 2.875% convertible bonds due 19 September 2008.
The bonds were issued at par and bear a coupon rate of 2.875% per annum, payable annually in arrears.
Each 1,000 principal amount of a bond is convertible into one 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference share of the issuer, LogicaCMG Jersey Limited, with paid-up value of 1,000 that will, in turn, be exchangeable immediately and mandatorily for ordinary shares of the company.
The bonds can be converted by the holders at any time between 29 October 2003 and up to 14 days prior to 19 September 2008.
The number of ordinary shares into which the bonds are convertible is determined by translating the principal amount into pounds sterling at a fixed exchange rate of 1.44862 1.00 and then dividing by the prevailing exchange price.
The exchange price is the price at which the sterling-equivalent par value of the 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference shares is converted into ordinary shares of the company.
The initial exchange price on issue was 372.53 pence per share but is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
The bonds issuer may, at its option, redeem the bonds at any time from 3 October 2006 if the companys share price is greater than 140% of the prevailing exchange price on at least 20 dealing days during a period of 30 consecutive dealing days, or, at any time, if 85% or more of the principal amount of the bonds have been previously converted or purchased and cancelled.

Financial instruments The main risks arising from the financial assets and liabilities of the group are foreign currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The groups policies with respect to managing these risks are set out below.
The group does not undertake any trading or speculative activity in financial instruments.
The group operates within policies and procedures that are formally approved by the board, which include strict controls on the use of financial instruments in managing the groups risk.
Short-term debtors, creditors and provisions less than one year have been excluded from the disclosures below.
Management of cash and current asset investments Surplus funds are invested in high-quality liquid marketable investments, including bank deposits, asset management funds and commercial paper.
Foreign currency risk Group companies have their local currency as their functional currency where the majority of turnover and expenses of group companies are denominated in their local currency.
To mitigate foreign currency risk, material contracted transactional amounts not denominated in the local currencies of group companies are hedged by means of forward contracts or currency overdrafts.
Remittances are then applied to the overdrafts.
The overdrafts are part of set-off arrangements against the positive cash balances of the group companies.
As a result of hedging provided by the use of currency overdrafts and forward contracts there are no material transactional currency exposures, which is consistent with the prior year.
For this reason, a table of foreign currency exposures as required in FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments has not been presented.
The group does not hedge the translation effect of the consolidated profit and loss account.
The translation of the groups balance sheet has been substantially hedged by managing the currency mix of the groups debt by the use of foreign currency borrowings and forward contracts.
The most significant consequence is to substantially hedge the groups euro denominated assets.
The selected currency mix takes into account the availability and cost of funds, and the sensitivity of the groups gearing and earnings ratios to exchange rate movements.
Interest rate risk The interest rate risk profile of the groups financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: Financial Financial liabilities Floating Fixed assets on Floating Fixed on which rate rate which no rate rate no interest financial financial interest is financial financial 2004 is paid liabilities liabilities receivable assets assets Total Currency m m m m m m m Sterling 5.9 88.1 0.9 24.8 23.1 47.0 Euro 0.3 0.5 211.2 8.0 39.5 5.2 159.3 Other currencies 0.4 11.0 16.5 2.6 29.7 6.2 89.0 212.1 43.8 79.1 7.8 176.6 The interest rate risk profile of the group's financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2003 was as follows: Financial Financial liabilities Floating Fixed assets on Floating Fixed on which rate rate which no rate rate no interest financial financial interest is financial financial 2003 is paid liabilities liabilities receivable assets assets Total Currency m m m m m m m Sterling 4.5 99.3 2.0 2.2 27.4 76.2 Euro 1.0 209.0 4.6 37.9 10.8 156.7 Other currencies 1.8 7.1 43.7 1.0 50.0 7.3 99.3 211.0 13.9 109.0 11.8 182.9 Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid related to provisions greater than one year and, in the prior year, to other borrowings see notes 16 and 18.
Floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates, based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents, which are fixed in advance for periods of between one day and six months.
The weighted average period until maturity for floating rate financial liabilities on which interest is paid was 39 months 2003: 28 months.
Fixed rate financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 represented amounts outstanding on convertible bonds and finance leases.
At 31 December 2003, fixed rate financial liabilities also included a bank loan.
The average interest rate on fixed rate liabilities for the year was 2.9 per cent 2003: 2.9 per cent.
The weighted average period for which rates are fixed on these financial liabilities was 45 months 2003: 56 months.
Financial assets generally earn interest at a floating rate based on relevant national LIBID equivalents or government bonds fixed in advance for periods ranging from one day to one month.
The groups policy is to fund its operations through a mixture of retained earnings, equity and bank debt.
To ensure immediate access without material interest rate penalty, group cash and liquid resources balances were primarily invested on a floating rate basis throughout the year.

Financial instruments continued Liquidity risk The groups policy is to maintain sufficient headroom to meet its foreseeable financing requirements.
Substantial committed facilities are maintained with a syndicate of leading international banks.
At 31 December 2004 the group had committed floating rate facilities of 330.0 million 2003: 230.0 million of which 65.0 million 2003: 100.0 million had been drawn down.
During the year the highest amount drawn on these facilities was 120.0 million 2003: 294.5 million.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities The book value of the primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the groups operations is not materially different from the fair value of those instruments, with the exception of the convertible bonds.
At 31 December 2004, the convertible bonds had a fair value of 205.6 million 2003: 215.8 million compared to a book value of 211.2 million 2003: 208.6 million.
The fair value of the convertible bonds was determined using market prices prevailing on 31 December 2004.
Fair values of forward foreign currency contracts are based on the market price of comparable derivative instruments at the balance sheet date.
The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amount and fair values of the groups derivative financial instruments.

The group selectively hedges its anticipated currency cash flow exposures on some product-related trade up to 18 months ahead through the use of forward contracts.
Currency risk on some contract bids is hedged proportionate to the likelihood of the contract being won.
For these contracts the currency risk is fully hedged once the contract has been won.
The table below shows the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
It also shows the amount of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in the next years, or later, profit and loss accounts.
