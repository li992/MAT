2004 2003 m m c Depreciation includes Depreciation in respect of assets held under finance leases 24 25 d Goodwill amortisation has mainly arisen from the initial acquisition of Rothmans and subsequent local restructurings of the enlarged Groups publicly listed subsidiaries in Singapore, Australia and South Africa in 1999, together with the restructuring of the Groups investment in Imasco in 2000, the British American Tobacco Australasia minority buyout in 2001, the acquisition of ETI at the end of 2003 and associates goodwill in respect of the Reynolds American transaction in 2004.
The goodwill arising on these transactions is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
The amortisation charge is shown as additional information on the face of the profit and loss account and for 2004 includes 262 million in respect of the initial acquisition of Rothmans and the subsequent restructurings, 105 million in respect of Imasco, 17 million in respect of Australasia, 77 million in respect of ETI and 37 million in respect of the Reynolds American transaction.
2004 2003 m m e US tobacco settlements ongoing costs 303 566 During the fourth quarter of 1998, a Master Settlement Agreement MSA was reached with Attorneys General in 46 US states the Settling States to settle the outstanding Medicaid recovery suits.
The initial costs in respect of this agreement, together with the initial costs arising from the earlier settlement between the US cigarette companies and the State of Minnesota and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, were charged in 1998 and 1999.
This included initial payments to those parties, together with legal fees, and also included the impact of Most Favoured Nation Clauses which increased amounts due under previous state settlements and advances on legal fees.
In addition, the four leading US tobacco manufacturers agreed to make annual payments, commencing in 1999 for 12 years, to states with tobacco grower communities to compensate them for any adverse effect of the settlement agreements.
The US tobacco industry will incur ongoing costs under the agreement with the Settling States.
The US tobacco manufacturers who entered into the agreement Settling Companies agreed to make payments to the Settling States in perpetuity.
The actual payments will be adjusted annually to reect changes in industry volume, ination and other factors.
Additionally, the Settling Companies will pay fees of the Settling States attorneys, and the amounts payable will be set by arbitration with a US$500 million annual cap for the first five years which rises to US$750 million in years 6 to 10 inclusive, less amounts previously paid as liquidated fees or by agreement.
The amount above for 2004 reects the seven months to 30 July 2004 for Brown & Williamson B&W prior to the Reynolds American transaction page 50 note 21.
During 2003, agreement was reached on certain disputed MSA payments relating to MSA calculations based on 1999 and 2000 sales.
This agreement resulted in a benefit of 27 million which is excluded from the 2003 costs shown above.
f Operating charges include investment costs written off and restructuring costs, which are shown as additional information on the face of the profit and loss account.
Considering the uncertainty of the timetable and the significant hurdles in establishing a major strategic investment in China, the Group has decided to write off all costs previously capitalised in reaching this stage of the project.

In the year ended 31 December 2004, Reynolds American contributed 789 million of net turnover and 146 million of operating profit before exceptional items, while B&W and Lane contributed 960 million of net turnover and 149 million of operating profit.
In the comparative twelve months, B&W and Lane contributed 1,974 million in net turnover and 316 million in operating profit.
On 23 December 2003, the Group completed the acquisition of ETI, page 51 note 21, and it is estimated that the acquisition contributed 1,451 million of net turnover and 157 million of operating profit for the year ended 31 December 2004.
2 Gain loss on disposal of subsidiaries and xed asset investments a Subsidiaries In 2004, the gain on disposal of subsidiaries amounted to 147 million 2003: 72 million loss before tax and 147 million 2003: 76 million loss after tax.
The Group announced on 27 October 2003, and completed on 30 July 2004, the agreement to combine B&Ws US domestic businesses with R. J. Reynolds RJR under Reynolds American Inc. a new holding company 58 per cent owned by RJR shareholders and 42 per cent by the Group, through B&W.
The Group also sold Lane to Reynolds American for US$400 million in cash.
This transaction gave rise to a realised gain of 127 million, page 50 note 21.
On 29 December 2004, the Group sold Etinera S. p. A. the distribution business of ETI, for 590 million.
The profit on this transaction was 20 million.
On 29 September 2003, a subsidiary of the Group absolutely and irrevocably transferred to a newly created Trust all of its rights, title and interest in and to 100 per cent of the issued and outstanding shares of The Flintkote Company Flintkote together with US$3 million in cash and did not receive any consideration in return.
The Trust, administered by an independent trustee, was created for the management, conservation and eventual disposition of the assets transferred to the Trust and named a medical facility active in the research and treatment of asbestos-related diseases as ultimate beneciary.
The Group has no continuing involvement in the Trust.
Since by virtue of this arrangement Flintkote was no longer a Group subsidiary, the Group ceased to consolidate Flintkote effective 29 September 2003.
The transfer resulted in a loss on disposal of 62 million before tax.
Flintkote, a US company, was part of the acquisition of Genstar Corporation by Imasco in 1986 and became a Group subsidiary following the restructuring of Imasco in 2000.
Flintkote has been named, along with a large number of defendants, in numerous actions by individuals who seek damages based upon alleged exposure to asbestos products, or alleged damage to their buildings due to the presence in the buildings of certain materials containing asbestos, allegedly manufactured and or sold by such defendants.
Certain of these claims and suits allege significant damage.
All claims relate to businesses which ceased active operations in the early 1970s.
To date substantially all of the claim costs and legal expenses incurred in connection with these suits have been covered by insurance proceeds and this continues.
However, there remain a number of factors, beyond the control of Flintkote, that could impact its future costs.
Regardless of the outcome of current and potential future claims against Flintkote, in the Directors view no future costs should accrue to the Group beyond what has already been presented in these financial statements.
The loss on disposals in 2003 also includes a provision for losses on the sale of the Groups shareholding of a company in Myanmar.
b Fixed asset investments In October 2004, the Group sold its 20 per cent stake in Lakson Tobacco Company in Pakistan, resulting in a profit on disposal of 27 million.
On 13 December 2004, the Group sold its 3 per cent investment in Bollor Investissement S. A. in France, resulting in a profit on disposal of 11 million.

V. Subsequently, in accordance with the terms of the convertible redeemable preference shares, 50 per cent of the convertible redeemable preference shares was redeemed for cash on 7 June 2000 and the remaining 50 per cent was converted into the same number of ordinary shares on 3 June 2004.
BAT Report 028-084. qxd 18 3 05 17:53 Page 39 British American Tobacco 39 Directors Report and Accounts 2004 7 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are based on equity earnings of 1,090 million 2003: 566 million and 2,088 million 2003: 2,102 million ordinary shares of 25p each, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
To comply with FRS14, the weighted average number of shares in issue excludes shares held by British American Tobacco and B.
A. T Industries Employee Share Ownership Trusts.
For the calculation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is increased to 2,156 million 2003: 2,241 million to reect the potential dilutive effect of the employee share schemes, as well as the convertible redeemable preference shares up to their conversion on 3 June 2004.
The earnings are correspondingly adjusted to the amount of earnings prior to charging dividends and the amortisation of discount on the convertible redeemable preference shares.
For 2003 the convertible redeemable preference shares were not dilutive for the unadjusted earnings per share calculation, and therefore the weighted average number of shares in issue was adjusted to 2,121 million.
Earnings have been affected by a number of exceptional items.

In addition to US litigation involving Group companies which is covered by the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT indemnity referred to in note 23, Reynolds American Inc. RAI group companies are named in litigation which do not involve Group companies.
While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash ows of RAI in particular quarterly or annual periods could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
However, having regard to the contingent liability disclosures on litigation made by RAI in its public financial reports, the Directors are satisfied with the carrying value included above for RAI.
The Groups share of the RAI results for the five months to 31 December 2004 includes 15 million in respect of external legal fees and other external product liability defence costs.

As a result the cost of awards made under the share schemes is now calculated with reference to the fair value of the shares at the date of the award rather than the cost of the shares purchased by the Group.
In addition, the net carrying value of shares held by the Groups ESOTs, previously shown as an asset in other investments in the balance sheet, is now deducted from shareholders funds.
The comparative gures for 2003 have been restated to reect the impact of these changes.
Consequently the interest of British American Tobaccos shareholders at 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003, as published last year, has been reduced by 107 million and 122 million respectively to reect the deduction of the net carrying value of the shares from shareholders funds.
The Group cash ow statement has been restated to show the relevant cash ows in nancing activities rather than capital expenditure and financial investment.
The impact of the revision to UITF Abstract 17 on the charges in respect of the share scheme awards is not material.

J. Reynolds in 2004 and the acquisition of Ente Tabacchi Italiani S. p. A. in 2003. a Reynolds American Inc.
Following the announcement on 27 October 2003, the agreement to combine Brown & Williamsons B&W US domestic businesses with R. J. Reynolds RJR under Reynolds American Inc. RAI, a new public holding company, was completed on 30 July 2004.
RAI is owned 58 per cent by RJR shareholders and 42 per cent by the Group, through B&W.
The Group received shares in RAI valued at 1,415 million by reference to RJRs closing share price and, in addition, the Group sold Lane to RAI for US$400 million 220 million in cash.
This transaction has been accounted for in accordance with UITF Abstract 31, which gives rise to goodwill relating to the Groups investment in RAI which is being accounted for as an associated undertaking and a gain on the partial disposal of the Groups US domestic businesses.
The provisional goodwill of 1,693 million arises as follows: Accounting Book value Revaluation policies Other Fair value m m m m m Goodwill 772 772 Intangible assets 407 407 Tangible xed assets 201 71 272 Deferred tax assets 154 3 8 143 Stocks 160 20 180 Other assets 428 8 420 Borrowings 380 380 Deferred tax liabilities 180 24 147 9 Retirement benets 258 78 336 Other liabilities 559 7 552 Fair value of assets acquired 745 13 12 1,032 262 Goodwill 1,693 Consideration 1,431 The book value and fair value of assets acquired comprises 42 per cent of RJR.
The book values of the net assets and liabilities have been revalued to fair value as at the acquisition date.
The main adjustments are revaluations of land, buildings and plant and equipment, together with revaluations of the liabilities for post retirement benets, and the related effect on deferred tax.
The accounting policy adjustments are to remove the LIFO accounting for inventories in RAI.
The Other column includes the removal of goodwill and intangibles carried in the local books.
The consideration has been determined by reference to the value placed on the shares in RAI received of 1,415 million, and acquisition expenses of 16 million.
The partial disposal of B&Ws US domestic businesses and Lane gave rise to a non-taxable gain of 1,045 million, after costs of 20 million which are included net of a deferred tax credit of 11 million.
The gain reects the difference between 58 per cent of the net assets including goodwill of B&W and Lane and the consideration received, which comprises the 42 per cent shareholding in RAI valued at 1,415 million and 58 per cent of the proceeds for the disposal of Lane less the costs of 20 million.
Of this gain, 127 million has been treated as realised being 58 per cent of the cash received in respect of the Lane disposal and included in the Group profit and loss account on page 28.
The balance of 918 million is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses on page 29.
In arriving at the disposal gain, 58 per cent of the goodwill previously written off to reserves in 1994 on the acquisition of American Tobacco Company, amounting to 216 million, has been reinstated and is shown in the changes in the interest of British American Tobaccos shareholders on page 29.

b British American Racing Holdings Ltd The Group ceased to be the controlling company of British American Racing Holdings Ltd. BAR on 7 December 2004, when BAR went into administration.
The Group ceased to consolidate BAR from that date.
In January 2005, a joint venture between British American Tobacco and Honda Motor Co. Ltd. acquired the BAR business.
As there is now shared control with Honda, BAR will no longer qualify as a subsidiary of the Group and will in future be reported as an associated company.
c Ente Tabacchi Italiani S. p. A.
On 16 July 2003, the Group announced a successful bid to acquire Ente Tabacchi Italiani S. p. A. ETI, the Italian State tobacco company.
Completion of this transaction was subject to regulatory approval which was subsequently given and on 23 December 2003 the Group completed the purchase of ETI.
This transaction was completed at a cost of 1,658 million, including UK acquisition costs of 11 million, resulting in a goodwill amount of 1,608 million.
The adjustment to the provisional goodwill previously reported was 10 million, relating to additional provisions and acquisition costs.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 50 million.
As explained on page 36 note 2, on 29 December 2004 the Group sold Etinera S. p. A. the distribution business of ETI.
d Other acquisitions in 2003 i On 4 April 2003, the Group announced that it had acquired controlling interests in a number of companies in Peru, including the leading tobacco company Tabacalera Nacional S. A.
With the aggregate consideration to the vendors of all the various shareholdings acquired of 146 million, the goodwill arising on these transactions was 132 million.
The consideration of 146 million comprises 141 million of cash and UK acquisition costs of 5 million.
The book value of net assets acquired was adjusted for the recognition of additional provisions of 9 million, with a consequent adjustment to goodwill.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 14 million.
ii On 4 August 2003, the Group was confirmed as the winning bidder for a controlling interest in the Serbian tobacco company Duvanska Industrija Vranje a. d. This transaction was completed on 22 September 2003.
The initial holding of 68 per cent was subsequently increased to 78 per cent in December 2003.
The total consideration for this acquisition was 43 million, resulting in goodwill of 40 million.
The consideration was satisfied by 41 million of cash and UK acquisition costs of 2 million.
The fair value of net assets acquired was 3 million.
iii On 12 December 2003, the Group converted US$136 million 90 million of its convertible loan stocks in BAR, raising its shareholding in the Company from 50 per cent to 89 per cent and so changing the status of that company from a joint venture to a Group subsidiary.
There was no material difference between the fair value and book value of the net liabilities acquired.
The transaction resulted in no goodwill.
When an associate or joint venture becomes a subsidiary, the method for calculating goodwill differs between the Companies Act 1985 and FRS2.
In order to give a true and fair view, the Group has complied with FRS2 in arriving at the gures above.
If the Act had been followed, the goodwill arising on acquisition would have been 44 million as it would have reected the share of accumulated net losses while the company had been treated as a joint venture.

23 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments There are contingent liabilities in respect of litigation, overseas taxes and guarantees in various countries.
Product liability litigation Group companies, notably Brown & Williamson Holdings, Inc. formerly Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation B&W, as well as other leading cigarette manufacturers, are defendants, principally in the US, in a number of product liability cases.
In a number of these cases, the amounts of compensatory and punitive damages sought are significant.
Indemnity On 30 July 2004, B&W completed transactions combining its US tobacco business assets, liabilities and operations with R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company.
A new company called R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company RJRT was created as a result of the combination transactions.
These transactions the Business Combination were accomplished through a new publicly traded holding company Reynolds American Inc. RAI, which is the indirect parent corporation of RJRT.
The Group, through B&W, owns approximately 42 per cent of the outstanding common stock of RAI.
As a result of the Business Combination: a B&W discontinued the active conduct of any tobacco business in the US: b B&W contributed to RJRT all of its assets other than the capital stock of certain subsidiaries engaged in non-US businesses and other limited categories of assets: c RJRT assumed all liabilities of B&W except liabilities to the extent relating to businesses and assets not contributed by B&W to RJRT and other limited categories of liabilities and contributed subsidiaries or otherwise to the extent related to B&Ws tobacco business as conducted in the US on or prior to 30 July 2004: and, d RJRT agreed to indemnify B&W and each of its afliates other than RAI and its subsidiaries against, among other matters, all losses, liabilities, damages, expenses, judgements, attorneys fees, etc, to the extent relating to or arising from such assumed liabilities or the assets contributed by B&W to RJRT the RJRT indemnification.
The scope of the RJRT indemnification includes all expenses and contingent liabilities in connection with litigation to the extent relating to or arising from B&Ws US tobacco business as conducted on or prior to 30 July 2004, including smoking and health tobacco litigation, whether the litigation is commenced before or after 30 July 2004 the tobacco litigation.
Pursuant to the terms of the RJRT indemnification, RJRT is liable for any possible judgements, the posting of appeal bonds or security, and all other expenses of and responsibility for managing the defence of the tobacco litigation.
RJRT has assumed control of the defence of the tobacco litigation involving B&W and RJRT is also a party in most but not all of the same cases.
Accordingly, RJRT uses or plans to use the same law rm or rms to represent both B&W and RJRT in any single or similar case except in certain limited circumstances as RJRTs interests are typically aligned with B&Ws interests, and RJRT has substantial experience in managing recognised external legal counsel in defending the tobacco litigation, and external counsel have independent professional responsibilities to represent the interests of B&W.
In addition, in accordance with the terms of the RJRT indemnification, afliates of B&W have retained control of the defence in certain tobacco litigation cases with respect to which such afliates are entitled to indemnification.
BAT Report 028-084. qxd 18 3 05 17:53 Page 53 British American Tobacco 53 Directors Report and Accounts 2004 23 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued US litigation The total number of US product liability cases pending at year end involving B&W and other Group companies was approximately 3,896 2003: 4,302 cases.
UK-based Group companies have been named as co-defendants in some 1,026 of those cases 2003: 1,128 cases.
Only perhaps a dozen cases are likely to come to trial in 2005, some involving amounts ranging possibly into the hundreds of millions and even billions of dollars.
Since many of these pending cases seek unspecified damages, it is not possible to quantify the total amounts being claimed, but the aggregate amounts involved in such litigation are significant.
External legal fees and other external product liability defence costs were 37 million in 2004 2003: 66 million.
The cases fall into four broad categories: a Medical reimbursement cases These civil actions seek to recover amounts spent by government entities and other third party providers on healthcare and welfare costs claimed to result from illnesses associated with smoking.
Although B&W continues to be defendant in healthcare cost recovery cases involving plaintiffs such as hospitals, Native American tribes, and local and foreign governments, the vast majority of such cases have been dismissed on legal grounds.
As at 31 December 2004, reimbursement suits were pending against B&W by one Indian tribe and by three county or other political subdivisions of the states.
The Master Settlement Agreement MSA with the 46 states includes a credit for any amounts paid in suits brought by the states political subdivisions: nevertheless, B&W intends to defend these cases vigorously.
Based on somewhat different theories of claim are four non-governmental medical reimbursement cases and health insurers claims.
One third party reimbursement case is scheduled for trial in 2005 City of St Louis in which more than 60 public and non-profit hospitals in Missouri seek reimbursement of past and future alleged smoking related healthcare costs.
b Class actions As at 31 December 2004, B&W was named as a defendant in some 14 2003: 36 separate actions attempting to assert claims on behalf of classes of persons allegedly injured or nancially impacted through smoking or where classes of tobacco claimant have been certied.
Even if the classes remain certied and the possibility of class-based liability is eventually established, it is likely that individual trials will still be necessary to resolve any actual claims.
Class-action suits have been led in a number of states against individual cigarette manufacturers and their parent corporations, alleging that the use of the terms lights and ultralights constitutes unfair and deceptive trade practices.
A new class action complaint Schwab, formerly known as McLaughlin was led in The US District Court for the Eastern District of New York on 11 May 2004 against B&W and other UK-based Group companies.
The complaint challenges the practices of the defendants with respect to the marketing, advertising, promotion and sale of light cigarettes.
The plaintiffs seek certication of a class of all US residents who purchased light cigarettes marketed, advertised, promoted and sold by the defendants and whose claims relate to the light cigarette fraud.
The judge has advised the parties that he will issue his class certication ruling on 31 August 2005 and a trial date of 14 November 2005 has been set.
Other types of class-action suits assert claims on behalf of classes of individuals who claim to be addicted, injured or at greater risk of injury by the use of tobacco or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, or the legal survivors of such persons.
In Engle Florida, one jury awarded a total of US$12.7 million to three class representatives and in a later stage of this three phase trial process, a jury assessed US$17.6 billion in punitive damages against B&W.
In November 2000, B&W posted a surety bond in the amount of US$100 million the amount required by Florida law to stay execution of this punitive damages award.
On 21 May 2003, the intermediate appellate court reversed the trial courts judgement and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions to decertify the class.
On 16 July 2003, the plaintiffs led a motion for rehearing which was denied on 22 September 2003.
On 12 May 2004, the Florida Supreme Court agreed to review this case.
Oral argument was held on 3 November 2004 and a decision is awaited.
In the first phase three trial of an individual Engle class member Lukacs, the jury awarded the plaintiff US$37.5 million in compensatory damages B&Ws share: US$8.4 million.
On 1 April 2003, the jury award was reduced to US$25.125 million B&Ws share: US$5.65 million but no final judgement will be entered until the Engle appeal is resolved.
Therefore the time to appeal this case has not yet begun to run.
In a Louisiana medical monitoring case brought on behalf of Louisiana smokers Scott, on 28 July 2003, the jury returned a verdict in favour of the defendants on the medical monitoring claim but made findings against the defendants with respect to claims relating to fraud, conspiracy, marketing to minors and smoking cessation.
On 21 May 2004, the jury returned a verdict in the amount of US$591 million on the classs claim for a smoking cessation program.
On 1 July 2004, the court upheld the jurys verdict and entered final judgement.
On 29 September 2004, the defendants posted a US$50 million bond legislation in Louisiana limits the amount of a bond to prevent execution upon such a judgement to US$50 million collectively for signatories to the MSA.
RJRT posted US$25 million i. e. the portions for RJRT and B&W towards the bond.

The defendants sought reconsideration of the certication ruling, which was denied on 25 October 2002.
On 14 February 2003, the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted the defendants petition to review the class certication decision.
Oral argument was heard on 20 November 2003.
The case is currently stayed pending appeal.
c Individual cases Approximately 3,867 individual cases were pending against B&W at 31 December 2004 2003: 4,245 led by or on behalf of individuals in which it is contended that diseases or deaths have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ETS.
Of these cases: a approximately two thirds are ETS cases brought by ight attendants who were members of a class action Broin that was settled on terms that allow compensatory but not punitive damages claims by class members: b approximately one quarter of the individual cases against B&W are cases brought in consolidated proceedings in West Virginia in which B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. is also involved: and c only about 10 per cent are cases led by other individuals.
Of the cases that went to trial or were decided or remained on appeal during 2004, several resulted in verdicts against B&W.
In April 2003, a Florida jury Eastman awarded US$650,000 damages against B&W whose appeal against this decision was rejected on 7 May 2004.
B&Ws petition for a rehearing was denied on 14 October 2004 so, on 29 October 2004, RJRT, pursuant to its obligation to indemnify B&W, sent the plaintiffs counsel the amount of the judgement, attorneys fees and costs, plus accrued interest approximately US$1.2 million.
In May 2003, an Arkansas jury Boerner awarded US$4.025 million in compensatory damages and US$15 million in punitive damages against B&W, this decision was appealed against and on 7 January 2005, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit upheld the first instance compensatory damages award of US$4.025 million and reduced the punitive damages award to US$5 million.
In November 2003, a Missouri jury Thompson awarded US$210,000 damages against B&W.
A notice of appeal was led on 8 March 2004.
In December 2003, a New York jury Frankson awarded US$350,000 compensatory damages against B&W and two industry organisations.
In January 2004, the same jury awarded US$20 million punitive damages.
On 22 June 2004, the trial judge granted a new trial unless the parties agree to an increase in compensatory damages to US$500,000 and a decrease in punitive damages to US$5 million, of which US$4 million would be assigned to B&W.
On 25 January 2005, B&W noticed an appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of New York.
In one of the Broin ight attendant cases French discussed in more detail above, a 2002 jury award of US$5.5 million in compensatory damages against all the defendants, including B&W, was subsequently reduced to US$500,000 of which US$123,500 was assigned to RJRT and US$82,000 to B&W.
The allocation of damages between the defendants was reversed on appeal on 22 December 2004 and the trial court was instructed to enter a judgement nding the defendants jointly and severally liable for the plaintiffs injuries.
On 14 January 2005, the defendants led a petition for a rehearing and a decision is awaited.
On 1 February 2005, a Missouri jury Smith awarded US$500,000 in compensatory damages against B&W and then, on 2 February 2005, awarded US$20 million in punitive damages, also against B&W.
Post trial motions will be led within the appropriate time.
d Other claims As at 31 December 2004, two 2003: seven cases were pending against B&W on behalf of asbestos companies.
Those companies seek reimbursement for costs and judgements paid in litigation brought by third parties against them.
These companies claim that, but for the smoking of the claimants, their damages would have been less.
The contribution claims in five separate cases have been dismissed, leaving the cases pending as to the claims of the individual plaintiffs only.
As at 31 December 2004, B&W was named as defendant in three 2003: four US cases brought by foreign government entities seeking reimbursement of medical costs which they incurred for treatment for persons in their own countries who are alleged to have smoked imported cigarettes, including those manufactured by B&W.
UK-based Group companies As at 31 December 2004, B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. was named as a co-defendant in the US in one class action and in the consolidated proceedings of over 1,000 individual cases in West Virginia, aside from which it is involved in only a few individual cases.
It is contesting the jurisdiction of the US courts since it is a holding company not transacting business in the US.
A. T Industries p. l. c. has successfully contested jurisdiction in some 35 cases prior to trial.
In the balance of these cases, there has been no adverse ruling on the issue of jurisdiction afrmed on the merits through appeal.
Some 193 US plaintiffs have voluntarily agreed to drop B.
A. T Industries p. l. c. or substitute the subsidiary Group company British American Tobacco Investments Limited formerly called British-American Tobacco Company Ltd as a co-defendant.
British American Tobacco Investments Limited has been served in one asbestos case and four reimbursement cases as well as the Department of Justice case see below, three class actions and four individual actions.
The Company is named as co-defendant in one class action.
BAT Report 028-084. qxd 18 3 05 17:53 Page 55 British American Tobacco 55 Directors Report and Accounts 2004 23 Contingent liabilities and financial commitments continued Conduct based claims On 22 September 1999, the US Department of Justice brought an action in the US District Court for the District of Columbia against various industry members, including R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and B&W.
British American Tobacco Investments Limited is also now a co-defendant in the action.
The Government sought to recover federal funds expended in providing healthcare to smokers who have developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related, and, in addition, seeks, pursuant to the federal Racketeer Inuenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, disgorgement of profits the government contends were earned as a consequence of a RICO racketeering enterprise.
On 28 September 2000, the portion of the claim which sought recovery of federal funds expended in providing healthcare to smokers who have developed diseases and injuries alleged to be smoking-related was dismissed.
The bench non-jury trial of the RICO portion of the claim began on 21 September 2004.
The trial is expected to last around six months.
On 17 November 2004, the Washington DC Circuit Court of Appeals heard an appeal by the defendants against an earlier District Court decision that disgorgement of profits is an appropriate remedy to the RICO violations alleged by the Government.
On 4 February 2005, the Court of Appeals allowed the appeal, ruling that the government could not claim disgorgement of profits.
The Government is seeking to appeal.
Various departments of the Republic of Colombia brought actions against various tobacco companies including B&W and other UK-based group companies alleging that the defendants engaged in cigarette smuggling and money laundering in their territories.
Each of these actions seeks compensatory, punitive and treble damages.
The defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was granted in 2002 and the plaintiffs appealed.
The dismissal of the claims was afrmed on 14 January 2004 but on 13 April 2004 the plaintiffs petitioned the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari.
A decision by the Supreme Court is pending.
Product liability outside the US At year end, active claims against Group companies existed in 19 countries outside the US but the only countries with more than five active claims were Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands and the Republic of Ireland.
As at 31 December 2004, there were some 1,050 pending individual cases in Italy.
Some 1,029 of these cases are pending before Justices of the Peace courts and relate to light cigarettes.
The plaintiffs in these cases claim that the word lights is misleading and has induced them to smoke.
Because of the type of court, the most that any individual plaintiff can recover is 1,033.
There are around 21 smoking and health cases led by or on behalf of individuals in which it is contended that diseases or deaths have been caused by cigarette smoking or by exposure to environmental tobacco smoke ETS.
In Canada, the constitutionality of the Tobacco Damages and Health Care Costs Recovery Act is under appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada.
In Quebec, in February 2005, two smoking and health class actions were certied.
These decisions will be appealed in due course.
Conclusion While it is impossible to be certain of the outcome of any particular case or of the amount of any possible adverse verdict, the Company believes that the defences of the Group companies to all these various claims are meritorious both on the law and the facts, and a vigorous defence is being made everywhere.
If an adverse judgement is entered against any of the Group companies in any case, an appeal will be made.
Such appeals could require the appellants to post appeal bonds or substitute security in amounts which could in some cases equal or exceed the amount of the judgement.
In any event, with regard to US litigation, the Group has the benefit of the RJRT indemnification.
At least in the aggregate and despite the quality of defences available to the Group, it is not impossible that the results of operations or cash ows of the Group in particular quarterly or annual periods could be materially affected by this and by the final outcome of any particular litigation.
Having regard to all these matters, the Directors i do not consider it appropriate to make any provision in respect of any pending litigation and ii do not believe that the ultimate outcome of this litigation will signicantly impair the financial condition of the Group.

In addition, costs of 19 million 2003: nil, included in dened benefit schemes funded above, have been charged in the costs of the Reynolds American Inc. transaction, see page 50 note 21.
The Groups subsidiary undertakings operate over 100 active retirement benefit arrangements worldwide.
These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
The majority of employees belong to dened benefit schemes, most of which are funded externally, although the Group also operates a number of dened contribution schemes.
The contributions to the dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
Pension commitments are nanced according to accepted current practices in each country, which for the material arrangements means using the projected unit method with surpluses or deficits being amortised over the average expected remaining service lives of the respective memberships.
All schemes are formally valued at least every three years.
The total market value of pension scheme assets at the dates of the most recent formal actuarial valuations or later formal reviews of the externally funded dened benefit schemes was 2,645 million 2003: 3,350 million, 325 million 2003: 580 million lower than the total value of projected accrued benets at the same dates.
The 2003 valuations include the US operations, which are excluded in 2004 following the Reynolds American Inc. transaction, see page 50 note 21.
Any deficit or surplus in individual schemes is being eliminated by increased or reduced company contributions, amendments to scheme benets or a combination of both.

These schemes accounted for over 75 per cent of the total obligations of the Groups externally funded schemes.

Pension increases, where allowed for, were generally assumed to be in line with ination.
In certain countries, pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis.
In such cases provisions are included in the Group balance sheet.
These amounted to 653 million 2003: 638 million, see page 43 note 16.
The most significant component of these provisions is a scheme in Germany, where a provision of 511 million was held in the balance sheet at the end of 2004 2003: 473 million in respect of these obligations.
The annual cost was 70 million 2003: 33 million.
At 31 December 2004, investments in equities, bonds and property with an estimated market value of 508 million 2003: 475 million were pledged in respect of the liabilities, see page 41 note 11.
The liabilities and annual costs for the scheme have been determined using a 5.8 per cent investment return with some allowance for salary and pension increases, in line with or more conservative than normal local practice.
The Group also operates significant plans in Canada which provide employees with certain other retirement benets such as healthcare.
The liabilities in respect of these benets are assessed by qualied independent actuaries, applying the projected unit method.
The discount rate assumption used was 6 per cent.
For healthcare ination, the assumption was 10 per cent reducing to 5 per cent by 2010.
The current year and prior year provisions are shown on page 43 note 16.
FRS17 Retirement Benets During 2004, the Group has continued to account for retirement benefit costs in accordance with SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs and the information shown above has been prepared in accordance with this standard.
The Group has not fully adopted FRS17 but the information provided below reects its transitional disclosure requirements.

The main increases in contributions were for the schemes in the UK, US and Canada.
BAT Report 028-084. qxd 18 3 05 17:53 Page 59 British American Tobacco 59 Directors Report and Accounts 2004 24 Retirement benefit schemes continued Future contribution rates will be agreed after consultation with the respective trustees and actuaries of the individual externally funded dened benefit schemes, taking into account regulatory requirements.
There are a number of closed schemes where the current service cost expressed as a percentage of pensionable earnings will increase under the projected unit method as scheme members approach retirement age.
It is considered that the increase in these costs will not be material in the context of the Groups total retirement benefit scheme costs.
