62 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The accounts are drawn up in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain land and buildings and the treatment adopted in respect of the valuation of certain current asset investments see note 17.
As required by the Companies Act 1985, the directors have adopted the true and fair override in respect of the accounting for the Exchange Property see note 17.
In line with Technical Release 21 04 issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England & Wales, the group has amended its treatment within shareholders funds of own shares held by the ESOP Trust.
The value of such shares held by the group is now deducted from distributable reserves, rather than being held in a separate reserve, and the prior year comparative figures have been restated as set out in note 24 on page 88.
Basis of consolidation The accounts of the group consolidate the results of the company and its subsidiary undertakings, and include its share of its joint ventures results on the gross equity method, all of which are made up to 31 December.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for businesses acquired with fair values applied to the acquired operation.
The results of such businesses are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition, up to the date of disposal or closure.
From 1 January 2002, where the group contributes a business, or other non-monetary asset for an interest in a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, such transactions are recorded so that the reduction in ownership of the business being contributed is accounted for as a disposal while the increased interest in the enlarged group or new interest in the business contributed by other parties to the transaction are accounted for as an acquisition.
Fair values are applied to those operations which are subject to the exchange and which have not previously been held within the group.
Any loss or realised gain resulting from the transaction is recorded in the profit and loss account while any unrealised gain is recorded in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Prior to 31 December 2001 such exchanges of interest were recorded so as to reflect the economic substance of the transaction.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation, on an exchange of interest, or on acquisition of joint venture interests, is capitalised in respect of all transactions from 1 January 1998.
Such goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis through the profit and loss account over its estimated useful economic life, based upon assessments of the durability of markets, product ranges and projected future profitability of the businesses concerned.
Prior to 1998, goodwill was either capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account or was written off directly to reserves depending upon the circumstances of each acquisition.
To date all goodwill capitalised has been assessed as having a 20 year estimated useful economic life.
Impairment reviews are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year following each acquisition and also if events or changes in circumstance indicate that such a review is necessary.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit and loss on disposal or termination is calculated including any remaining capitalised goodwill or the gross amount of any related goodwill previously written off directly to reserves, as appropriate.
Company accounts In the companys accounts, all fixed asset investments including subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are stated at cost or valuation in respect of certain listed investments less provisions for permanent diminutions.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the companys profit and loss account.
In accordance with section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
The amount of the profit for the financial year of the company is disclosed in note 24 to these accounts.
Relief under sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985 is taken whenever possible.
Accordingly, where such relief is available, the difference between the fair value and aggregate nominal value of shares is not recognised in either shareholders funds or cost of investment.
Revenue recognition Sales are recognised when the group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance, this is usually when title passes or a separately identifiable phase of a contract or development has been completed and accepted by the customer.
Sales comprise the net value of such deliveries made, work completed or services rendered during the year and include the groups net share of sales of joint ventures.
Turnover represents sales made by the company and its subsidiary undertakings, excluding the groups share of sales of joint ventures.
Profit is recognised at the time of sale.
In the case of contracts with extended delivery programmes, it is arrived at by reference to the estimated overall profitability of the contract and appropriate provision is made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Foreign currencies Transactions in overseas currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction or, where forward cover contracts have been arranged, at the contracted rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities, including goodwill, denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date or at a contracted rate if applicable and any exchange differences arising are taken to the profit and loss account.
For consolidation purposes the assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Exchange differences arising on foreign currency net investments are taken to reserves.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 63 1 Accounting policies continued Research and development Group funded revenue expenditure on research and development is written off as incurred and charged to the profit and loss account, except where supported under contract.
Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided, normally on a straight line basis, to write off the cost or valuation of tangible fixed assets over their estimated useful economic lives to any estimated residual value, using the following rates: Buildings up to 50 years, or the lease term if shorter Research equipment 8 years Computing equipment, motor vehicles and short life works equipment 3 to 5 years Other equipment 10 to 15 years, or the project life if shorter In the groups North America business, depreciation is normally provided on a basis consistent with cost reimbursement profiles under US government contracts.
Typically this provides for a faster rate of depreciation than would otherwise arise on a straight line basis.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land and assets in the course of construction.
Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Leases Assets obtained under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost and are depreciated over their useful economic lives, or the term of their lease, whichever is shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included within loans.
Rental payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged as interest to the profit and loss account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments, so as to give a constant rate of charge on the outstanding obligation.
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis in arriving at operating profit.
Assets held for leasing out under operating leases are included in tangible fixed assets at cost less depreciation.
Rental income from aircraft operating leases is recognised in sales as the receipts fall due.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost, including all relevant overhead expenditure, and net realisable value.
Long-term contracts the amount of profit attributable to the stage of completion of a long-term contract is arrived at by reference to the estimated overall profitability of the contract.
Appropriate provisions are made for any losses in the year in which they are first foreseen.
Work in progress relating to long-term contracts is stated at cost less provision for anticipated losses.
Development properties the net realisable value is based on advice received from independent valuers and assumes the grant of relevant planning consent but excludes any development profit.
Cash received on customers account and customer stage payments Amounts received from customers in accordance with the terms of contracts which specify payments in advance of delivery are credited, as progress payments, against any expenditure incurred upon stocks or work in progress for the particular contract.
Any unexpended balance is held in creditors as customer stage payments or, if the amounts are subject to advance payment guarantees unrelated to company performance, as cash received on customers account.
Cash received on customers account is excluded from the figure for net debt as defined by the group.
Aircraft financing The group is exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing, both from financing arranged directly by the group and from that arranged by third parties where the group has provided guarantees or has other recourse obligations.
Provision for these risks is made on a systematic basis.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are designated as a hedge at the inception of contracts.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
Gains and losses on foreign currency hedges are recognised on maturity of the underlying transaction, other than translational hedges of foreign currency investments, net of related borrowings, which are taken to reserves.
Gains and losses arising from retiming of foreign exchange transactional cover are deferred to match the maturity of the underlying exposure.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments which are cancelled due to the termination of underlying exposure are taken to the profit and loss account immediately.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
Short-term debtors and creditors that meet the definition of a financial asset or liability respectively have been excluded from the Financial Reporting Standard 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments FRS 13 disclosures where permitted by that standard.
64 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 Accounting policies continued Tax The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised on an undiscounted basis in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date where there is an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits These costs have been provided under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for pension costs SSAP 24 where the expected cost of providing pensions and other post retirement benefits, as calculated periodically by independent actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the expected average remaining service lives of current employees.
The group operates several pension schemes providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the group.
The group has followed the transitional disclosure arrangements required by Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement benefits FRS 17.
Share options and own shares held In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 25 National insurance contributions on share option gains UITF 25 the group provides in full for the employers national insurance liability estimated to arise on the future exercise of share options granted, except where the employee has agreed to settle the employers national insurance liability as a condition of the grant of the options.
The group has taken advantage of the exemption offered in Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 Employee share schemes UITF 17 from charging to the profit and loss account the 20% discount offered to employees partaking in such company operated SAYE schemes.
As required under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts UITF 38 the cost to the company of own shares held is shown as a deduction from shareholders funds within the profit and loss account.
Consideration paid or received for the purchase or sale of the companys own shares in the ESOP trust is shown separately in the reconciliation of movements in shareholders funds.
Sales to JVs within other business groups are included in the intra-group sales adjustment.
Sales to JVs are reinstated to derive external turnover.
Acquisitions in 2004 contributed sales and operating profit after goodwill amortisation of 38m, and 1m, respectively in Customer Solutions & Support, 73m and 1m in North America and 167m including share of joint ventures sales of 6m and 2m in HQ and other businesses.

In addition, a detailed review of the carrying value of goodwill across the group has been performed which has resulted in a 16m impairment charge in respect of the goodwill relating to the Integrated Defence Solutions business in North America and a 50m impairment charge in respect of the goodwill relating to the naval ships business, in line with the reduced MoD requirement for Type 45 destroyers.

The majority of the groups operational properties at that time were valued on a depreciated replacement basis, owing to their specialisation, with the remainder on an existing use value basis.
Other non-operational properties were valued on the basis of open market value: - short leaseholds at cost: - additions subsequent to 30 June 1996 at cost: and - land and buildings owned by subsidiary undertakings acquired since 30 June 1996 at fair value at the date of acquisition.
Following the adoption in 2000 of Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible fixed assets FRS 15 the company has elected that no further revaluation of land and buildings will be undertaken for statutory reporting purposes.

Dilution of interest Following the completion in July 2004 of the conversion of debentures held by employees of Saab to shares, the groups share of the net assets of Saab increased by 6m.
As a result of the increased shares in issue the groups economic interest in Saab was diluted from 35% to 34.2%, reducing the groups share of net assets by 4m.
The net effect of 2m has been treated as an unrealised gain within the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

In 2004 these costs were netted off against the matching adjustment to liabilities, resulting in an increase in the reported share of joint venture net assets and a corresponding reduction in debtors.

Further cash consideration to a maximum of 26m may be payable depending on the future performance of OMCs business.
The acquisition of OMC has been accounted for as a trade investment at a fair value of 48m pending assumption of management control.
The remaining consideration paid has been treated as satisfying a pre-existing offset obligation held within creditors.
OMC is a holding company with investments in aerospace and defence companies in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Impairment provision created The impairment provision created in the year relates to the groups 20% holding in Exostar LLC, formed in 2000 as a business-to-business procurement facilitation company and based in the US.

The SYSTEMS 2001 Asset Trust bonds are at a floating rate of interest.
The other loan notes were issued to certain shareholders of Alvis plc as part of the consideration paid by the group on acquisition of that company as set out in note 10.
The notes pay a floating rate of interest on the principal amount outstanding and are redeemable at par at the option of the holder on 31 December in any of the years up to 2009, at which time any outstanding balance will be redeemed by the company.
Finance lease obligations are generally repayable in periodic instalments monthly or annual and incur interest at 8%.
The remaining borrowings identified above are all at the fixed rates shown.
At 31 December 2004 borrowings of 1,429m 2003 1,434m are at fixed rates of interest compared to 955m 2003 1,094m at floating rates of interest.

80 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 17 Exchangeable Bonds and Exchange Property The company has in issue 676m 2003 676m 3.75% Senior Unsecured Exchangeable Bonds the Bonds, due in 2006.
At any time prior to the due date the Bondholders have the right to request to exchange their Bonds for the Exchange Property, which is represented by the groups holding in the ordinary share capital of Vodafone Group Plc see note 15.
On receiving such early redemption notice, the company has the option to settle the Bond in cash, based on the prevailing market value of the Exchange Property.
The company does not intend currently to use this option to settle any material proportion of the Bonds in cash.
Any Bonds still outstanding on the due date will be settled by the company in cash at the principal amount.
The Bonds are recorded at issue price less unamortised issue costs, which represent the maximum economic exposure.
The value of the Exchange Property was initially based on the issue price of the Bonds, which represented the realisable value to the group.
The historical cost of the Exchange Property to the group is negligible, and the uplift to match the Exchange Property to the value of the Bonds was recorded as an unrealised gain within other reserves.
This treatment of the Exchange Property represents a departure from the normal requirements of the Companies Act 1985 under which current asset investments are to be carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
This basis would, for the reasons set out above, in the opinion of the directors not reflect the economic substance of the transaction nor show a true and fair view.
At 31 December 2004 the value of the groups holding in Vodafone Group Plc was less than the redemption value of the Bonds.
Accordingly the group has recorded the value of the Exchange Property at its market value at that date.
The movement in 2004 of 13m in the market value of the Exchange Property has been offset against the original unrealised gain within other reserves, and disclosed within the non-cash movements in the consolidated movement on net debt.

The balance remaining, after the allocation of any such losses to work-in-progress, is recorded as a liability provision.
The associated outflows are estimated to occur over the period of the contract, normally between one and five years.
Other provisions include legal costs, insurance and environmental commitments.
Warranties and after-sales service Warranties and after-sales service are provided in the normal course of business with provisions for associated costs being made based on an assessment of future claims with reference to past experience.
Such costs are generally incurred within one to five years post delivery.
Reorganisations ongoing operations The provision relates to 2004 and prior year rationalisation programmes.
Regional aircraft This provision contains the costs associated with the decision in 2001 to close the regional jet aircraft activities, principally manufacturing, and reorganise certain other commercial aerospace activities see note 6 and recourse provisions see note 20 in respect of financing arrangements for aircraft previously sold by the group.
The recourse element of the provision of 253m 2003 253m covers costs to be incurred over the period to 2013 and the directors believe it is appropriate to state the recourse provisions at its net present value NPV.
Adjustments to NPV are recorded within other provision movements.
Of the adjustment of 56m in 2004, 13m was transferred to the creditor balance in respect of aircraft financing see note 20 as a non-cash movement within the amount utilised in the year.
Provisions arising on acquisitions The amount arising on acquisitions represents the fair value of provisions held at acquisition by Alvis plc, DigitalNet Holdings Inc and other companies acquired by the group during the year see note 10.
Other provision movements Reclassifications between provision categories are reported within other provision movements.
Company Provisions created relate to onerous property leases.

At 31 December 2004 the groups future payments in respect of these arrangements were 2,344m 2003 2,717m.
As part of a restructuring of its gross obligations through the issue of a limited recourse bond in 2001, the group pre-financed certain of the residual value guarantees.
The future cash flows associated with this pre-financing totalled 518m at 31 December 2004 2003 594m.
A significant proportion of the net exposure of 1,826m 2003 2,123m is covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme FRIP which provides insurance cover in respect of potential shortfalls in contracted and expected income.
Any anticipated liability in respect of uninsured amounts is accounted for on a net present value basis.
Since the inception of the FRIP, the group has granted residual value guarantees in respect of aircraft sold totalling 393m 2003 400m.
After taking account of independent appraisal valuations the directors consider that the groups net exposure to these guarantees is covered by the provisions held, on a net present value basis, and the residual values of the related aircraft.
The group is also exposed to actual and contingent liabilities arising from commercial aircraft financing and residual value guarantees given by Saab AB and Airbus SAS.
Provision is made against the expected net exposures on a net present value basis.
The groups share of such exposure is limited to its percentage shareholding in each of these joint ventures.

Guarantees and performance bonds The group and company have entered into a number of guarantee and performance bond arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.

These assets have not been recognised as the precise incidence of future profits in the relevant countries and legal entities cannot be sufficiently accurately predicted at this time.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of future remittances of the accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiary undertakings and joint ventures as there are no binding agreements entered into by the subsidiaries and joint ventures to distribute these past earnings.
No significant potential liability to tax is expected to arise if properties included at valuation in the accounts were realised at their revalued amounts.

The Special Shareholder is entitled to receive notice of and to attend general meetings and class meetings of the companys shareholders but has no voting right, nor other rights, other than to speak in relation to any business in respect of the Special Share.
The 7.75p net cumulative redeemable preference shares of 25p each are convertible into ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
During the year 24,705 shares were converted for 11,834 ordinary shares.
The company may redeem all of the remaining preference shares at any time after 1 July 2007 and, in any case, will redeem any remaining shares on 1 January 2010, in each case at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividend.
The maximum redemption value of the preference shares, ignoring any arrears or accruals of dividends, is therefore 266m and this amount has been disclosed on the face of the balance sheet as the total of non-equity shareholders funds.
The preference shares carry voting rights at a general meeting of the company only where the preferential dividend is six months or more in arrears, or where a motion is to be proposed which abrogates, varies or modifies the rights of the preference shareholders, or where a motion is to be proposed for the winding up of the company.
On a winding up, holders of the preference shares are entitled, after repayment of the capital paid up on the Special Share and in priority to any payment to any other class of shareholder, to the return of amounts paid up or credited as paid up on the preference shares together with a premium of 75p per share, and all arrears of preferential dividends.

FRS 17 was issued in November 2000 but the Accounting Standards Board has deferred full mandatory implementation.
Prior to this, transitional disclosures are required which, to the extent they are not given in note a, are set out in b. a Pension schemes The group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
The main schemes are funded defined benefit schemes and the assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension scheme valuations are regularly carried out by independent actuaries to determine pension costs for pension funding, SSAP 24 and FRS 17 purposes.
The details of the principal schemes, their respective latest valuation dates, and the financial assumptions used for the SSAP 24 valuations are given below.
Valuation method and date UK schemes BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit Pension Scheme 5 April 2002 BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit 2000 Pension Plan 6 April 2004 Royal Ordnance Projected Unit Pension Scheme 31 December 2001 BAE SYSTEMS VSEL Section Attained Age Shipbuilding Industries Pension Scheme 1 April 2004 Principal assumptions used in the valuations for the UK schemes were that in the long term the average return on investments would exceed: 2004 2003 % % Average increases in pay by 2.50 to 3.25 2.00 to 3.00 Average increases in pensions by 3.75 to 4.25 3.50 to 4.00 Dividend growth by 2.75 2.75 Valuation method and date US schemes BAE SYSTEMS Projected Unit Employee Retirement Plan No.
1 1 January 2004 As permitted under SSAP 24 the US schemes have been accounted for under the Financial Accounting Standards Boards Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
Principal assumptions used in the valuations for the US schemes were that in the long term the average return on investments would be 8.75% 2003 8.75% and average increases in pay would be 5.83% 2003 5.42%.
The aggregate of the market values of the assets of the principal schemes operated by the group at the latest date of actuarial valuation totalled 9.3bn 2003 9.7bn.
The actuarial value for the assets covered approximately 96% 2003 100% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries.
The market value of these assets at 31 December 2004 was approximately 9.8bn 2003 9.1bn.
The net deficit is being amortised using the straight line method over the estimated average service lives of the related scheme members of 9 to 14 years.
The net charge to the profit and loss account amounted to 192m 2003 127m, excluding charges in respect of the contributions made by the groups joint venture companies.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 91 27 Post retirement benefit schemes continued Pension prepayments included in debtors of the group amounted to 602m 2003 532m note 14 and pension liabilities included in the creditors of the group amounted to 122m 2003 107m note 18.
Cash contributions by the group to the pension schemes totalled 237m 2003 233m.
In addition, 70m 2003 62m of cash contributions were received into the various schemes from joint venture companies.
The group also incurred a charge in respect of the cash contributions of 40m 2003 32m paid to defined contribution pension schemes for certain employees.
A charge of 2m 2003 2m has also been incurred, with cash paid of 2m 2003 2m, for pensions under Atlas Electronik GmbHs unfunded pension arrangement.
The estimated future liabilities as at 31 December 2004 totalled 51m 2003 49m and are included in the balance for pensions within creditors referred to above.
This scheme has been accounted for under the International Accounting Standards Boards International Accounting Standard No.
As a result of the groups acquisition of Alvis plc, charges have been made to the profit and loss account in respect of that companys pension schemes and these are included in the figures set out above.
Prepayments and accruals at 31 December 2004 are also included above, together with the estimated future liabilities of the companys unfunded Swedish pension scheme which totalled 13m at the year end and have been included within the balance for creditors.
The groups pension funding requirements are derived from separate independent actuarial valuations required by the company and the trustees of the various schemes.
Post retirement benefits other than pensions The group also operates a number of non-pension post retirement benefit plans, under which certain employees are eligible to receive benefits after retirement, the majority of which relate to the provision of medical benefits to retired employees of the groups subsidiaries in the US.
These schemes are generally unfunded.
The latest valuations of the principal schemes, covering retiree medical and life insurance plans in certain US subsidiaries, were performed by independent actuaries as at 1 January 2004.
The method of accounting for these is similar to that used for defined benefit pension schemes.
The gross liability at 31 December 2004 amounts to 57m 2003 68m, all of which is held within provisions note 19. b Transitional FRS 17 disclosure The disclosures below relate to retirement benefit plans in the UK, US and Europe the latter arising in respect of Atlas Elektronik and Alvis plc accounted for on a defined benefit basis under FRS 17.
The valuations used for the FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuation undertaken by independent qualified actuaries and updated to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the surplus deficit of the schemes at 31 December each year.
Scheme assets are stated at the market value at 31 December each year and scheme liabilities are based on the results of the last actuarial valuation.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for the schemes were: UK schemes US schemes 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 % %% % %% Inflation rate 2.70 2.60 2.30 3.00 3.00 4.00 Rate of increase in salaries 3.70 3.60 3.30 5.83 5.40 4.50-4.80 Rate of increase for pensions in payment 2.50-3.00 2.60-3.00 2.30-3.00 nil nil nil Rate of increase for deferred pensions 2.70 2.60 2.30 Discount rate 5.30 5.50 5.75 5.90 6.25 6.75 Long-term healthcare cost increases 5.70 5.80 4.50-5.50 92 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 27 Post retirement benefit schemes continued The assumptions used by the actuaries are estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of scheme assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of scheme liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, as at 31 December were: UK pension schemes Long term rate of return Value 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 % %% m m m Equities 8.25 8.50 8.50 6,220 5,996 5,131 Bonds 5.00 5.20 4.50 1,883 1,701 1,623 Other mainly property 6.25 6.50 6.50 1,101 712 579 Total market value 9,204 8,409 7,333 Present value of scheme liabilities 13,074 11,152 10,125 Deficit 3,870 2,743 2,792 Related deferred tax asset 1,122 823 838 Net pension liability 2,748 1,920 1,954 US pension schemes Long term rate of return Value 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 % %% m m m Equities 9.00 9.00 10.50 623 591 500 Bonds 5.60 5.60 6.00 189 179 230 Other mainly property 6.60 6.60 8.00 132 126 64 Total market value 944 896 794 Present value of scheme liabilities 1,335 1,185 1,127 Deficit 391 289 333 Related deferred tax asset 149 110 123 Net pension liability 242 179 210 US healthcare schemes Deficit 69 99 74 Related deferred tax asset 26 38 28 Net healthcare liability 43 61 46 The deficit on the US healthcare schemes before deferred tax reflects assets of 39m 2003 34m and liabilities of 108m 2003 133m.

Financial instruments comprise net borrowings note 16 together with other instruments deemed to be financial instruments under FRS 13 including long-term debtors, long-term creditors and provisions for liabilities and charges.
Disclosures dealt with in this note exclude short-term debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS 13 except for the analysis of net currency exposures.
Interest rate risk management At 31 December 2004, after taking account of interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps, the currency and interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the group was as follows: Financial assets The interest rate profile of the financial assets of the group was: 2004 2003 Financial Financial Floating assets Floating assets rate Fixed rate on which rate Fixed rate on which financial financial no interest financial financial no interest assets assets is paid Total assets assets is paid Total m m m m m m m m Currency Sterling 1,519 812 2,331 738 2 827 1,567 US dollar 126 60 87 273 86 69 95 250 Other 188 3 191 132 43 175 Total 1,833 60 902 2,795 956 71 965 1,992 Floating rate financial assets attract interest at short-term interbank rates.
The weighted average period until maturity for financial assets on which no interest is paid is two to five years.
Fixed rate financial assets have a weighted average interest rate of 7.8% 2003 7.72% and a weighted average period to maturity of 10 years 2003 11 years.
Interest bearing financial assets comprise cash, money market deposits, certain fixed asset investments and debtors.
Financial assets on which no interest is paid include certain current asset investments and debtors.
In order to hedge certain long-term financial currency and interest rate exposures, the group has entered into a number of financial derivative contracts with maturities ranging between ten to thirty years.
Cash collateral payments can be required to be made periodically to the counterparty dependent upon the mark to market value of these financial derivatives.
Cash deposited in this way is treated as a long-term debtor and at the end of 2004 totalled 104m 2003 22m.

Maturity of financial liabilities Non-equity shares are redeemable on 1 January 2010.
The maturity profile of loans and borrowings is set out in note 16.
For the other financial liabilities, note 19, gives an indication of the underlying liabilities which in general cover a period of between one and five years from the balance sheet date.

BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 101 30 Financial instruments continued Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

The groups current interest rate management strategy is that a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 75% of debt is maintained at fixed interest rates.
Currency management The companys principal currency exposure is the US dollar sterling exchange rate.
In order to protect itself against currency fluctuations, the groups policy is to hedge all firm transactional exposures as well as to manage anticipated economic cash flow exposures over the medium term.
Liquidity management At 31 December 2004, the group had undrawn revolving credit facilities RCF of 1.5bn 2003 2bn, which expires in more than two years but less than five years 2003 500m expire in more than one year and less than two years and 1,500m expire in more than two years but less than five years.
The groups commercial paper programme is supported by the RCF with any amount outstanding reducing the amount that can be drawn down.
As at 31 December 2004, no amounts were outstanding under the commercial paper programme 2003 79m.
On 1 February 2005, the group renewed its RCF for a further five years taking advantage of the favourable market conditions to reduce the cost of the facility.
31 Related party transactions The group has an interest in a number of joint ventures, the principal ones of which are disclosed in note 12.
Transactions occur with these joint ventures in the normal course of business.
The more significant transactions are disclosed below: Purchases Amounts Amounts Sales to from owed by owed to related related related related party party party party Related party m m m m Airbus SAS 141 22 413 AMS NV 861 69 117 Eurofighter Jagdflugzeug GmbH 747 50 Flagship Training Limited 10 Gripen International KB 83 5 23 MBDA SAS 80 23 29 516 Panavia Aircraft GmbH 93 46 6 102 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 32 Post balance sheet events Agreement of Eurosystems transaction In January 2005, the group announced an agreement with Finmeccanica under which it will merge its UK-based airborne radar, electronic warfare and other operations, owned through BAE Systems Avionics Limited, with Finmeccanica's Galileo Avionics Spa businesses to form a new avionics business of which BAE Systems will initially own 25% and receive net cash consideration of 379m.
BAE Systems and Finmeccanica will have options, respectively, to sell and to buy this 25% stake in the future for a further cash consideration of 269m.
Selenia Communications Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Finmeccanica, will acquire the group's UK defence communications business for 25m in cash.
In addition, under an exchange of interests, BAE Systems will take full ownership of the UK activities of the AMS joint venture in exchange for the group's existing 50% share of the Italian activities and a cash equalisation payment of 50m.
Finmeccanica will also acquire the UK Air Traffic Management business of AMS for 10m.
During the year ended 31 December 2004, the avionics and defence communications businesses being sold by the group as part of the transaction, and which are all reported within the Avionics sector, generated total sales of 718m and a combined profit before goodwill amortisation and impairment, interest and tax of 33m.
The businesses being sold had net assets, including goodwill, which are the subject of this transaction of 673m at 31 December 2004.
The groups reported share of the UK operations of AMS for the year ended 31 December 2004 was: sales of 239m: profit before goodwill amortisation, interest and tax of 14m: and net assets, including goodwill, of 115m.
The groups reported share of the Italian operations of AMS for the year ended 31 December 2004 was: sales of 178m, profit before goodwill amortisation, interest and tax of 14m: and net assets, including goodwill, of 65m.
The transaction is subject to regulatory approval but the changes in economic and management control are effective from 1 January 2005 and legal completion is expected by the end of April 2005.
The group is reviewing its segmental analysis in order to move to a new reporting structure, including taking account of the impact of this transaction, and plans to report on this new basis in 2005.
Partial disposal of interest in Saab AB On 22 February 2005, the group announced its intention to dispose of up to 15.175 million of its holding in the series B shares of Saab AB, representing approximately 14% of the share capital by economic rights of Saab.
The disposal will be conducted by means of a placing and is expected to be concluded during March 2005.
Following this disposal the group will retain a shareholding representing slightly over 20% of the share capital by economic rights of Saab AB.
33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards Following the EUs adoption of Regulation No.
1606 2002 on the use of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS by EU-listed companies, the group is implementing IFRS from 1 January 2005.
The first financial information to be reported by the group in accordance with IFRS will be for the six months ending 30 June 2005 but the requirement to present comparative information means that a balance sheet as at 31 December 2003 and primary statements for 2004 prepared in accordance with IFRS will also be required.
The group has continued to report its consolidated accounts in accordance with UK GAAP for 2004.
The group plans to provide a separate reconciliation of the UK GAAP 2004 results and the balance sheet at 31 December 2003 to IFRS during the second quarter of 2005.
At that time a full explanation of the known impacts of IFRS will be given as well as details of the accounting policies that are expected to be adopted under IFRS as from 1 January 2005.
This analysis of the impact of IFRS is being prepared by the directors using their best judgement of the standards and interpretations expected to be effective, and the accounting policies expected to be adopted, when the directors prepare the companys first complete set of IFRS financial statements as at 31 December 2005.
Therefore, as these interpretations develop, there is a possibility that the analysis may evolve further before constituting the final IFRS balance sheet as at 31 December 2005 when the company prepares its first complete set of IFRS financial statements.
Commercial aircraft financing As previously reported, the group has provided guarantees in respect of residual values and head lease and finance payments on certain commercial aircraft sold.
These arrangements were transacted through special purpose entities SPEs that are not required to be reported as part of the consolidated group under UK GAAP.
In addition, the group entered into various lease arrangements that are treated as operating leases under UK GAAP.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 103 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued A significant proportion of the net exposures arising from these arrangements is covered by a Financial Risk Insurance Programme FRIP, which provides insurance cover for shortfalls in contracted and expected income.
At 31 December 2003, the total exposure provided for in accordance with UK GAAP under these obligations and guarantees, net of expected recoveries, was 404m relating to FRIP aircraft and 18m relating to post-FRIP aircraft on a net present value basis.
The gross and net obligations are set out in note 20.
On transition to IFRS, IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements IAS 27 requires the consolidation of all subsidiaries and SPEs which the group controls at 31 December 2003.
Based on the IAS 27 definition of control, and after taking into account the facts and circumstances relevant at the transition date, the group has determined that it controls the SPEs.
Accordingly, the gross assets and obligations of the SPEs will be consolidated in the IFRS balance sheet as at 31 December 2003.
In addition, a number of the lease arrangements will be reclassified from operating leases under UK GAAP to finance leases following their assessment against the lease classification criteria in IAS 17 Leases with resulting changes to assets and debt.
Excluding adjustments in respect of deferred tax and foreign exchange, the exposure relating to FRIP aircraft of 404m at 31 December 2003 is represented under IFRS by: m Aircraft related assets, guaranteed by insurance 615 Net debt 1,019 Exposure at net present value 404 Additionally, the reclassification of certain operating leases as finance leases outlined above will require the reclassification of amounts payable under operating leases of 58m included within creditors due after more than one year to amounts payable under finance leases within net debt.
The post-FRIP aircraft provision of 18m at 31 December 2003 under UK GAAP remains under IFRS.
Post retirement benefit schemes Under UK GAAP, the group currently accounts for defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs SSAP 24.
The group also reports the transitional disclosures required in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17, including the adjustment from the figures reported under SSAP 24 which would be required if FRS 17 was adopted in the financial statements.
The methodology and assumptions used to calculate the value of pension assets and liabilities under FRS 17 are substantially consistent with the requirements of IAS 19 Employee Benefits IAS 19.
In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19, the group will be allocating the IAS 19 pension deficit to the underlying group subsidiary companies and joint ventures and is currently evaluating appropriate methods of allocation.
One area of difference which may impact the adjustment from SSAP 24 to IAS 19 relates to the valuation of pension fund assets.
Under FRS 17, equities are valued using mid-market prices at valuation date whereas IAS 19 requires the use of bid prices.
Subject to any adjustment to the valuation of pension assets and an appropriate allocation to joint ventures, the group expects to recognise the following adjustment from SSAP 24 to IAS 19 in the IFRS group balance sheet at 31 December 2003: m m Remove assets and liabilities recognised in accordance with SSAP 24: Pension asset 532 Pension liability 107 Post retirement healthcare liability 68 Related deferred tax 115 242 Recognise assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 19: Pension liability for UK and US schemes 3,032 Pension liability for European schemes 49 Post retirement healthcare liability 99 Related deferred tax 991 2,189 Adjustment to shareholders funds 2,431 Revaluation of land and buildings It had been the groups policy under UK GAAP to revalue its land and buildings until FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets was adopted in 2000.
At that point the group elected that no further revaluation of land and buildings would be undertaken.
The group does not intend to adopt the exemption under the transition rules of IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS IFRS 1 that allows the previous GAAP valuation amount to be used as the deemed cost on transition to IFRS.
Accordingly the group will be reversing the previously recognised revaluations and will be reverting to the use of historical cost for land and buildings.
104 BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued Accounting for long-term contracts The group accounts for its substantial number of long-term contracts under UK GAAP in accordance with SSAP 9 Stocks and Long-Term Contracts.
Under IFRS, long-term contracts are accounted for under either IAS 11 Construction Contracts or IAS 18 Revenue depending on the characteristics of the contract and its deliverables.
These standards provide more guidance on the determination of the timing and amount of revenue recognition.
The impact of this detailed guidance is to reduce the amount of revenue recognised under UK GAAP on the early stages of certain long-term contracts.
Due to the approach taken for profit recognition under UK GAAP there is no impact on the reported profits for any period arising from this adjustment to recognised revenue.
Proposed dividends Under SSAP 17 Post Balance Sheet Events, proposed dividends are accrued for as an adjusting post balance sheet event in the accounting period to which they relate.
Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends are recognised in the accounting period in which they are declared.
Accordingly, the group will reverse the accrual for its final dividend and report it in the consolidated IFRS accounts for the following period.
Intangible assets goodwill Under UK GAAP, the groups policy is to capitalise goodwill in respect of businesses acquired and amortise it on a straight line basis over its estimated useful economic life, which has been assessed as 20 years for all acquisitions to date.
On transition to IFRS, IFRS 1 requires the group to review the carrying value of capitalised goodwill at 31 December 2003 for potential impairments.
In accordance with IFRS 3 Business Combinations, no amortisation of goodwill will be charged in the groups consolidated IFRS accounts from 1 January 2004.
Instead, annual reviews of the goodwill will be performed to test for potential impairments.
Intangible assets other Under IAS 38 Intangible Assets IAS 38, the group is required to recognise, capitalise and amortise other intangible assets on the balance sheet providing they meet certain and recognition criteria.
Intangible assets include software costs and company funded development expenditure which is discussed in more detail below.
IFRS 1 requires that where these intangible assets would have been recognised on an IFRS compliant balance sheet for any entity acquired the goodwill created at acquisition is reduced by an amount equal to the intangible assets that are now recognised.
There will be a subsequent net impact on the goodwill amortisation previously charged to the groups profit and loss account.
Research and development expenditure In 2003, the groups expenditure on research and development was 1.7 billion, of which 0.6 billion represented the groups share of research and development expenditure by its joint ventures.
Most of this expenditure was funded under specific customer projects.
The balance related to company funded research and development expenditure that was expensed as incurred.
Of this balance, a significant proportion relates to research costs that will continue to be expensed as incurred.
IAS 38 requires company funded development expenditure meeting certain recognition criteria to be capitalised on the balance sheet and amortised over the estimated life of the development product.
This standard is to be applied retrospectively.
Equity accounted investments The directors have reviewed the groups interests in those investments currently reported as joint ventures under UK GAAP.
IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures requires more emphasis to be placed on the legal form of arrangements rather than the substance of what happens in practice as under UK GAAP.
Accordingly, the directors have decided that the groups investment in Airbus is to be accounted for as an associate under IAS 28 Investments in Associates from the date of transition to IFRS.
The impact of the change in accounting treatment is only presentational and will not have an impact on income recognition or the amount of shareholders funds as the group will continue to account for its share of the Airbus results and net assets.
The accounting treatment for all other investments that are accounted for as joint ventures under UK GAAP remains unchanged on transition to IFRS.
Share-based payments Under UK GAAP, the cost of share options is based on the intrinsic value in the option at the date of grant, meaning that options granted to employees at market price or allowable discount do not generate an expense.
Under IFRS 2 Share-based Payments, the group is required to measure the cost of all share options granted since November 2002 using fair value models.
As a result, additional expense will be recognised in the IFRS profit and loss account.
BAE SYSTEMS Annual Report 2004 105 33 Transition to International Financial Reporting Standards continued Deferred tax Under IAS 12 Income Taxes, certain temporary differences, for example in respect of capital losses, rollover relief and investments in joint ventures, that previously were not recognised under UK GAAP, will be recognised.
In addition, deferred tax liabilities in relation to tax deductible goodwill, which were provided for under UK GAAP, will not be provided for under IFRS.
Derivative financial instruments The global nature of the groups business means it is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates.
The group also uses interest rate derivative instruments to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits by varying the proportion of fixed rate debt relative to floating rate debt over the forward time horizon.
To achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement IAS 39, the group is required to designate these financial instruments against specific assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
All such instruments are measured at fair value as at the balance sheet date and the effectiveness of each hedge tested against defined criteria.
Changes in the fair value of the financial instruments are recognised either in profit or loss for the period or, in the case of a cash flow hedge, directly in equity and subsequently recognised in profit or loss for the period when the underlying transaction is realised.
For financial instruments designated as fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedged item and the derivative are recognised in the profit or loss for the period.
Gains and losses on financial instruments, both realised and unrealised, that do not qualify for hedge accounting are included in profit or loss for the period.
The group aims to apply hedge accounting treatment for all derivatives that hedge material foreign currency exposures and those interest rate exposures where hedge accounting can be achieved.
With the adoption of IAS 39, all financial instruments will be recognised on the balance sheet as either financial assets or financial liabilities.
Under the IFRS transition rules, IAS 39 and IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation IAS 32 will apply to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 with no requirement for comparative information for the period to 31 December 2004.
Therefore, this area, and Exchangeable Bonds and preference shares discussed below, will continue to be accounted for under UK GAAP in the 2004 comparatives of the groups 2005 IFRS financial statements.
Exchangeable Bonds As described in note 17, the company has in issue Bonds of 676m due in 2006 which allow the Bondholders the option to exchange the Bonds for the Exchange Property, which is represented by the groups holding in the ordinary share capital of Vodafone Group Plc.
Under IAS 39 this option is considered to be an embedded derivative that has to be separated from the underlying debt balance, measured at fair value and accounted for separately from the debt within net assets.
Preference shares The group has in issue 7.75p net cumulative preference shares of 25p each that are convertible into the groups ordinary shares of 2.5p each at the option of the holder on 31 May in any of the years up to 2007, on the basis of 0.47904 ordinary shares for every preference share.
From 1 July 2007 to 1 January 2010, the company may redeem any outstanding shares at 100p per share together with any arrears and accruals of dividends.
In accordance with IAS 32 this is considered to be a compound financial instrument consisting of both a debt component and an equity component which require separate accounting treatment.
The debt component represents the amortised cost of the instrument and is presented as a component of liabilities in the IFRS balance sheet.
The equity component represents the value of the option at issue to convert the preference shares into ordinary shares and is presented separately within shareholders funds.
