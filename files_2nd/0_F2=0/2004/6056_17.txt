40 Notes to the financial statements 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modied to include the revaluation of certain xed assets, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings: all accounts are made up to 31 March 2004.
The results of subsidiary undertakings are included in the financial statements under the principles of FRS 6 from the date control passes.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
In the accounts of the Company, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the profit and loss account to the extent that they represent a realised profit for the Company.
c Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions made after 1 April 1998 is shown on the balance sheet as an intangible xed asset.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having a limited useful economic life, it is amortised over that life.
Where capitalised goodwill is regarded as having an indefinite useful economic life, it is not amortised.
Where capitalised goodwill is amortised over a life of greater than 20 years, or is not amortised, annual impairment reviews are conducted to compare the book value with the recoverable amount.
If the recoverable amount has fallen below the book value, the goodwill is written down to the recoverable amount immediately.
The Companies Act 1985 requires goodwill that is treated as an asset to be amortised systematically over a nite period.
In order to show a true and fair view of the Groups results, goodwill of 68.6m arising on the acquisitions of Mainline and Capital Citybus is not being amortised because of a number of factors which have led the Directors to conclude that the goodwill has an indefinite life.
These include the stability of the bus industry, its lack of fundamental change and the Groups track record in maintaining and enhancing the values of its businesses.
This treatment of goodwill as having an indefinite life is in accordance with FRS 10.
It is not possible to quantify the effect on the Groups results if the Act were to be followed, as it would depend on the nite life that was used.
Capitalised goodwill arising on other acquisitions is being amortised over a period of up to 20 years on a straight line basis.
Capitalised goodwill arising on foreign acquisitions is denominated in the currency in which the acquired companys assets and liabilities are recorded.
Fair value accounting adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions.
In the year of acquisition, some adjustments are made using provisional estimates, based on information available at the time the financial statements are prepared, and amendments are sometimes necessary in the following accounting period, with a corresponding adjustment to goodwill, when the information necessary to determine these estimates is available.
Prior to 1 April 1998, all goodwill arising on acquisitions was written off to reserves.
This goodwill has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
On disposal of the businesses concerned this goodwill is included in determining the gain or loss on disposal in the profit and loss account.
d Turnover Turnover represents the amounts receivable for services supplied to customers during the year and includes rail support grants and amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes.
e Fixed assets and depreciation Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less residual value of tangible xed assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years straight line Long leasehold buildings 50 years straight line Short leasehold properties period of lease Passenger carrying vehicles 7 to 15 years straight line Other plant and equipment 3 to 25 years straight line No depreciation is provided on freehold land, the land element of long leasehold properties or on assets in the course of construction.
Surpluses or deficits arising on the revaluation of tangible xed assets are credited or debited to a revaluation reserve.
On a subsequent disposal of a revalued asset, the revaluation surplus or deficit relating to this asset is transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
From 1 April 1999 the Groups policy has been not to revalue tangible xed assets.
Properties that had been revalued before that date retained their book value, in accordance with the transitional rules of FRS 15.
41 1 Principal accounting policies continued f Hire purchase contracts and leases Assets held under hire purchase contracts and under finance leases, which are those leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to the Group are recorded in the balance sheet as tangible xed assets.
Depreciation is provided on these assets over their estimated useful lives or lease term, as appropriate.
Future obligations under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are included in creditors, net of finance charges.
Payments are apportioned between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account as interest, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligations.
The finance charges are calculated in relation to the reducing amount of obligations outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account on the same basis.
All other leases are operating leases and the rental charges are taken to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
g Government grants and subsidies Rail support grants and amounts receivable for tendered services and concessionary fare schemes are included in turnover and are recognised in the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
h Stocks and work in progress Stocks are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
i Foreign currencies Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year end and results of foreign enterprises are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Differences on exchange arising on the retranslation of net investments in foreign enterprises and from the translation of results at an average rate are taken to reserves.
Where foreign currency borrowings or currency swaps are used to finance or hedge investments in foreign enterprises, the gain or loss on translation is also taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
j Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Provision is made for deferred tax on all timing differences except those arising from the revaluation of xed assets for which there is no binding agreement to sell or on the undistributed profits of overseas subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
Deferred tax is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated the tax will arise.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
The deferred tax provision is not discounted to net present value.
k Pension costs Retirement benets are provided for most employees of the Group by means of dened benefit pension schemes.
These are funded by contributions from the Group and employees.
The Groups contributions are charged to the profit and loss account, based on recommendations by independent actuaries, in such a way as to provide for the liabilities evenly over the average remaining working lives of the employees.
The difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid by the Group is shown as an asset or a liability in the balance sheet and the tax effect of this timing difference is included in deferred taxation.
l Financial instruments Various derivative instruments are utilised by the Group principally to manage interest rate, fuel and forward exchange risks.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk prole of an existing underlying exposure of the Group, in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps and fuel derivatives are recognised as adjustments to interest expense and fuel costs respectively over the period of the contracts.
m Insurance The Groups policy is to self-insure high frequency, low value claims within the businesses.
To provide protection above these types of losses, cover is obtained through third-party insurance policies.
Provision is made for the estimated cost of settling insurance claims for incidents occurring prior to balance sheet date.
n Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after the deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.

The tax on the gains arising would only become payable if the property were sold without rollover relief being available.
The tax which would be payable under such circumstances is estimated to be 0.2m 2003: 0.6m.
These assets are expected to be used in the continuing operations of the business and, therefore, no tax is expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised on property gains as it is anticipated that rollover relief will be available.
To benefit from the relief the proceeds should be reinvested in new property within three years of disposal.
The tax that would be payable assuming that reinvestment was not made within three years amounts to 2.5m 2003: nil.
No deferred tax has been provided on the future remittance of overseas reserves as it is not expected that the reserves will be repatriated to the UK in the foreseeable future.

The 250m bond is repayable in 2019 and was swapped to US Dollars on a oating six month LIBOR basis.
The Sterling equivalent shown is net of a foreign exchange gain of 9.1m on retranslation at year end and is also net of 1.3m of issue related costs which are being amortised over the term of the bond.
Certain subsidiaries have issued guarantees to the Companys bondholders.
These guarantees rank pari passu with guarantees provided by those subsidiaries to the Groups bank lenders participating in the Groups 400m syndicated bank facility.
19 Financial assets and liabilities Foreign currencies At 31 March 2004, the Groups profit and loss account was not exposed to material exchange rate risk from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as all such material balances are used to hedge the Groups overseas net assets.
Interest rates After taking account of interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, details of the interest rate prole of the Groups financial liabilities, excluding cash, was as follows: Fixed rate liabilities Weighted Total average Weighted financial Floating Fixed interest average liabilities rate rate rate period m m m % Years At 31 March 2004 Sterling 490.3 108.7 381.6 6.97 8.0 US Dollars 249.6 83.3 166.3 2.89 2.5 Canadian Dollars 8.0 8.0 Euros 8.0 8.0 755.9 208.0 547.9 At 31 March 2003 Sterling 417.2 13.2 404.0 7.53 8.9 US Dollars 277.9 117.4 160.5 6.22 1.7 Canadian Dollars 10.6 10.6 705.7 141.2 564.5 The weighted average xed interest rates of 6.97% and 2.89% on the respective Sterling and US Dollar liabilities include xed rates under the Groups interest rate hedging programme, which accounts for 15% on Sterling xed rate debt and 100% for US Dollar xed rate debt.
Sterling xed rate debt includes an all-in cost of 7.1% relating to the 300m Sterling bond.
Bank margins negotiated on oating rate debt range from 0.225% to 0.8% over Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR where applicable, or the bank base rate for the currency concerned.
Financial assets, which consist wholly of cash on deposit and in hand of 125.2m 2003: 81.3m, are all denominated in Sterling except 3.0m 2003: 3.1m in US Dollars and 0.6m 2003: 1.5m in Canadian Dollars.
Deposited cash earns interest at commercial rates negotiated with counterparty banks.

As a result of movements in interest rates, differences arise between book values and fair values, which are categorised as unrecognised gains and losses as required under FRS 13.
The Group also protects its financial position and performance against fuel price risk using a range of fuel derivatives.
Movements in fuel prices relative to the prices provided by the derivatives gives rise to differences between book and fair values which are categorised as unrecognised gains and losses as required under FRS 13.
Fair values for derivatives and the bonds have been supplied externally by the respective counterparties and banks using market rates prevailing at year end.
The book value of the 300m bond is stated at its par value less issue costs of 4.5m 2003: 4.9m.
The book value of the 250m bond, which is swapped to US Dollars on a oating rate six month LIBOR basis, is stated at its par value less issue costs of 1.3m and net of an unrealised foreign exchange gain of 9.1m.
Fair values for hire purchase debt and loan notes have been determined by discounting future cash ows that will arise under these liabilities.
The movement in net unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used to hedge interest rate risk and fuel price risk are as follows: Net unrecognised gains losses 2004 2003 m m At beginning of year 15.7 5.0 Arising in previous year but recognised in the year 23.4 5.1 Arising before beginning of year and remaining at the end of the year 7.7 0.1 Arising in the year 4.7 15.8 At end of year 3.0 15.7 It is expected that 3.0m of the net unrecognised gains 2003: 15.7m unrecognised losses will be recognised in the following year.

The performance bonds relate to the North American businesses 103.6m and the UK Rail franchise operations 83.2m.
The letters of credit relate substantially to insurance arrangements in the UK and North America.
The Company has provided a 9.0m 2003: 9.0m unsecured loan facility to Great Eastern Railway Limited GER, a 15.5m 2003: 15.5m unsecured loan facility to Great Western Trains Company Limited GWT and a 6.5m 2003: 6.5m unsecured loan facility to North Western Trains Company Limited NWT as required by the Director of Passenger Rail Franchising.
Neither of the GER or GWT loans were drawn at 31 March 2004 or 31 March 2003, while the NWT loan was fully drawn at 31 March 2003 and undrawn at 31 March 2004.
The Company is party to the guarantees granted to banks for overdraft and cash management facilities provided to itself and subsidiary undertakings.
The Company has given guarantees for the liabilities of its subsidiary undertakings arising under certain loan notes, hire purchase contracts, finance leases, operating leases, supply contracts and to certain pension scheme trustees.
It also provides cross guarantees to certain subsidiary undertakings as required by VAT legislation.
UK bus subsidiaries have provided guarantees on a joint and several basis to Trustees of the UK Occupational Pension Scheme.
Certain of the Companys subsidiaries have issued guarantees to the Companys bondholders.
These guarantees rank pari passu with guarantees provided by those subsidiaries to lenders participating in the Groups 400m syndicated bank facility.
57 30 Pension schemes The Group operates or participates in a number of pension schemes which cover the majority of UK employees and certain North American employees.
These are principally dened benefit schemes under which benets provided are based on employees number of years of service and final salary.
The scope of benets varies between schemes.
The assets of the schemes are held in separately administered trusts which are managed independently of the Groups nances by investment managers appointed by the schemes trustees.
Formal independent actuarial valuations are undertaken at least triennially.
The various dened benefit schemes include five UK Bus Division schemes where the subsidiary undertaking is a participating employer in a scheme operated by a local authority.
These schemes are subject to relevant local government regulations.
Great Eastern Railway Limited, Great Western Trains Company Limited, North Western Trains Company Limited, GB Railways Group Plc and First Keolis TransPennine Limited have sections in the Railways Pension Scheme RPS which is an industry-wide arrangement for employees of those companies previously owned by British Railways Board.
All other Group schemes are self-administered.
At their last triennial valuations, the dened benefit schemes had funding levels between 68% and 118%.
For those schemes that do not meet the minimum funding requirement, additional payments totalling 1.0m per annum are being made.
The market value of the assets at 31 March 2004 for all dened benefit schemes totalled 1,254m 2003: 934m.
Contributions are paid to all dened benefit schemes in accordance with rates recommended by the schemes actuaries.
The total charge to the profit and loss account in the year in respect of dened benefit schemes was 31.9m 2003: 24.1m.
The valuation assumptions used for accounting purposes have been made uniform to Group standards, as appropriate, when each scheme is actuarially valued.
For these new valuations excluding the local government and RPS schemes, the assumptions which are being used are that the rate of return on investment will be 7.0% pre-retirement 6.75% in respect of future benefit accrual, and 6.0% post-retirement 5.75% in respect of future benefit accrual, the rate of earnings growth will be 4.0% and the rate of ination will be 2.5%.
These new valuations are made using the projected unit method.
Prepayment A net prepayment of 41.5m 2003: 33.2m is included in the Groups consolidated balance sheet in respect of the sum of the cumulative differences between contributions paid by the Group into the schemes and the charge to the profit and loss account under SSAP 24, and the surpluses and deficits that have been recognised on acquisition.
For accounting purposes the pension costs for the RPS are determined by spreading the expected company cash contributions over the term of the relevant franchise.
Dened contribution schemes In addition, the Group operates some dened contribution schemes, the assets of which are held in separately administered trusts.
The cost of these in the year was 2.3m 2003: 2.0m.
The Group pays certain costs on behalf of the various pension schemes and then re-charges the costs to the schemes.
Transitional FRS 17 disclosures The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 during the transitional period for the dened benefit schemes are set out below.
They are based on the most recent actuarial valuations described above, which have been updated by independent professionally qualied actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
The main financial assumptions per annum used in this update were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.1 3.6 4.0 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.5 2.1 2.5 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 2.5 2.1 2.5 Discount rate 5.7 5.7 6.0 Ination assumption 2.6 2.1 2.5 Certain in-house bus schemes pensions in payment receive LPI increases of 2.5% 2003: 2.1% and LPI increases with a minimum of 3.3% 2003: 3.0%.

Grants were made in October 1995 and June 1999 and further grants were made in December 2002 and December 2003.
The scheme is based on eligible employees being granted options and their agreement to opening a sharesave account with a nominated savings carrier and to save weekly or monthly over a specified period.
Sharesave accounts are held with Lloyds TSB for the 2002 and 2003 grants.
The right to exercise the option is at the employees discretion at the end of the period previously chosen for a period of six months.
Options granted in December 2002 and December 2003 are exercisable after three years.
The number of options outstanding under each grant at the end of the year was as follows: 2004 2003 Earliest Number of Ordinary 5p Number of Ordinary 5p Exercise exercise Grant date employees shares employees shares price p date October 1995 55 64,204 107.72 November 02 June 1999 68 19,059 359.73 September 02 December 2002 5,229 5,945,274 5,865 6,642,805 192.00 February 06 December 2003 2,497 1,903,176 232.00 February 07 7,726 7,848,450 5,988 6,726,068 During 2002, the Company launched a Share Incentive Plan, the Buy As You Earn scheme BAYE.
BAYE enables eligible employees to purchase shares from their gross income.
The Company provides two matching shares for every three shares bought by employees, subject to a maximum Company contribution of shares to the value of 20 per month.
The shares are held in trust for up to five years, in which case, no income tax and national insurance will be payable.
The matching shares will be forfeited if the corresponding partnership shares are removed from trust within three years of award.
At 31 March 2004 there were 3,938 2003: 3,058 participants in the BAYE scheme who have purchased 730,258 2003: 92,570 shares with the Company contributing 217,513 2003: 29,261 matching shares.
b Executive share option schemes The executive share option scheme, together with the deferred share element of the Executive Annual Bonus Plan, replaced the Long-term incentive plan LTIP described below.
Executive share options are exercisable between three and ten years of the date of grant provided that the pre-determined performance criteria are met.
Further details of the scheme including the performance criteria, are included in the Directors remuneration report.
Details of executive share options outstanding at 31 March 2004 are set out below: Ordinary 5p shares 2004 2003 Exercise Date original Scheme No.

The exercise of awards under the scheme was conditional upon the attainment of performance targets.
To achieve the maximum value under an award, the Companys total shareholder return over a performance period of not less than three years must be such to place the performance relative to the returns earned by the companies in the top 25% of companies in the FTSE 250 Share Index excluding investment trusts.
An award is not exercisable if the Companys performance would place the Company below the 50th percentile of the index.
Performance between the 25th percentile and the 50th percentile of the index results in a proportion of the award being exercisable in accordance with a sliding scale.
Regardless of performance relative to the index, an award will not be exercisable unless growth in earnings per share has been greater than RPI over the performance period.
The price payable for shares upon the exercise of any award is xed at the date of grant.
Awards are, in effect, exercisable at no cost other than any tax charges to the participant.
The award prices and the maximum number of shares subject to awards are as follows: Ordinary 5p shares 2004 2003 Award Date of award No.
price p 3 July 2000 369,644 935,960 236.00 For the three-year period ended 31 March 2003, FirstGroup plcs total shareholder return was 10.7%, which was the 16.6th percentile of the index.
As a result, participants were entitled to 200% of the 2000 award which was equivalent to the maximum number of shares.
