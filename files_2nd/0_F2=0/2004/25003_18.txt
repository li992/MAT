Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Principal accounting policies a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Change in accounting policy The Group has adopted the provisions of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts.
As a result, shares in ICAP plc owned by the Groups employee share ownership trusts, which were previously shown as an asset in the balance sheet, are now treated as a deduction from reserves within shareholders funds.
The results for the year ended 31 March 2003 have been restated accordingly.
The effect on the balance sheet of both the Group and the Company has been to reduce equity shareholders funds by 2.2m as at 31 March 2003, and by 3.9m as at 31 March 2004.
There is no impact on the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2003 or for the year ended 31 March 2004. b Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated Financial Statements comprise the Financial Statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Details of the Companys principal subsidiaries are given on pages 74 and 75.
Unless stated otherwise, business combinations are accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting whereby the Groups results include the results of acquired or disposed businesses from the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
In the Groups consolidated Financial Statements, joint ventures and associates are accounted for under the equity method whereby the Groups profit and loss account includes its share of their profits and losses and the Groups balance sheet includes its share of their net assets.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 not to present its own profit and loss account.
c Turnover Turnover comprises commission and brokerage income derived from securities broking, derivatives and money broking, energy broking, electronic broking and information services.
Securities broking comprises voice broking and is mainly transacted on a matched principal basis.
To represent the substance of matched principal services provided by the Group, where it acts as principal for the simultaneous purchase and sale of securities to third parties, commission income represents the differential between the consideration received on the sale of the security and its purchase price.
Derivatives and money broking and energy broking comprise voice broking and are mainly transacted on an agency basis.
For agency trades turnover is stated net of rebates and discounts, value added tax and other sales taxes.
Electronic broking includes the broking of securities and derivatives and money broking products on electronic platforms.
Turnover recognition for these products is in accordance with the treatment for the equivalent voice broked products.
Turnover from information services represents fees received from the sale of financial information to third parties.
This is stated net of value added tax and other sales taxes.
d Government grants Revenue grants receivable are credited to the profit and loss account in the same period as the related expenditure is charged.
e Goodwill Goodwill arises upon the acquisition of subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures and represents the cost of the acquisition in excess of the fair value of the Groups share of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are determined based upon an assessment of the value of the individual assets and liabilities acquired, including reference to market prices where relevant.
For acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998, goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets allow this goodwill to remain eliminated.
Goodwill previously charged directly against reserves prior to FRS 10 is reflected in the profit and loss account when calculating the profit or loss on the subsequent disposal or termination of acquired businesses.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2004 44 For acquisitions on or after 1 January 1998, goodwill is capitalised and amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
The useful economic life of the goodwill is determined at the time of the acquisition and is subsequently reviewed at the end of each reporting period by considering the nature of the business acquired, the economic environment in which it operates and the period of time over which the Group expects to derive value from the purchase of the business.
Amortisation periods for all significant acquisitions are given in note 12.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings is shown within intangible fixed assets.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures and associates is included within their carrying value.
f Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values and are depreciated on a straight line basis over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Short leasehold property Period of lease Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 - 5 years Motor vehicles 3 - 4 years Software development 3 - 5 years The Group reviews its depreciation rates regularly to take account of any changes in circumstances.
These rates are determined upon consideration of factors such as the expected rate of technological development and anticipated usage levels.
Depreciation is charged against assets from the date at which the Group begins to derive economic benefit from the asset.
When a leasehold property becomes surplus to the Groups foreseeable business requirements, provision is made on a discounted basis for the expected future net cost of the property.
g Leased assets Assets financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group finance leases are capitalised in the consolidated balance sheet.
Lease repayments comprise both a capital element and a finance element.
The capital element of the leasing commitment is shown as an obligation to the lessor in the balance sheet and the finance element is charged to the profit and loss account on a constant periodic rate of change basis.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
h Fixed asset investments i Subsidiary undertakings An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Group has control over its operating and financial policies.
In the Companys Financial Statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values.
ii Associates The consolidated Financial Statements include investments in associated undertakings under the equity method of accounting.
An associated undertaking is an entity in which the Group has a participating interest and, in the opinion of the directors, can exercise significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies.
The profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the operating profit or loss, exceptional items, interest income or expense and attributable taxation of those entities.
The balance sheet shows the Groups share of the net assets or liabilities of those entities, together with loans advanced and attributable goodwill.
A participating interest exists where an investment is held on a long-term basis for the purpose of securing a contribution to the Groups activities.
Significant influence will generally exist where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders voting rights.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2004 45 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Principal accounting policies continued iii Joint ventures The consolidated Financial Statements include investments in joint ventures under the gross equity method of accounting.
A joint venture is an entity in which the Group has a long-term interest and exercises joint control.
Under the gross equity method, a form of the equity method of accounting, the Groups share of the aggregate gross assets and liabilities underlying the investment in the joint venture is included in the balance sheet and the Groups share of the turnover of the joint venture is disclosed in the profit and loss account.
iv Other investments Other fixed asset investments, comprise equity shareholdings and other interests.
They are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values.
Dividend income is recognised upon receipt and interest when receivable.
i Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Fixed assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment review in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying value of the fixed asset or goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the net book value of the fixed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Net realisable value represents the amount at which the asset could be sold.
Value in use is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows obtainable as a result of the assets continued use, including those resulting from its ultimate disposal, at a market based discount rate on a pre-tax basis.
The carrying value of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which it occurs.
If the occurrence of an external event gives rise to a reversal of an impairment loss, the reversal is recognised in the profit and loss account as well as by increasing the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill only up to the amount that it would have been had the original impairment not occurred.
For the purpose of conducting impairment reviews, income generating units are identified as groups of assets, liabilities and associated goodwill that generate income that is largely independent of other income streams.
The assets and liabilities include those directly involved in generating the income and an appropriate proportion of those used to generate more than one income stream.
j Matched principal business Certain Group companies are involved as principal in the purchase and simultaneous commitment to sell securities between third parties.
Such trades are complete only when both sides of the deal are settled, and so the Group is exposed to risk in the event that one side of the transaction remains unmatched.
Substantially all the transactions settle within a short period of time and the settlement risk is considered to be minimal.
In order to reflect the substance of these transactions, the amounts due to and payable by counterparties in respect of matched principal business expected to settle in the normal course of trading are offset and the net amount is included in trade debtors.
For information purposes, the gross amounts are disclosed in note 16.
Outstanding transactions which have gone beyond settlement date initially unsettled transactions and where neither side of the transaction has settled are shown gross and are included in debtors and creditors in notes 16 and 18.
Transactions where one side has settled but the other remains outstanding unmatched transactions are also shown as the gross amount on the balance sheet in either trade debtors or trade creditors with the corresponding amount included as a cash movement.
k Stock lending transactions Certain Group companies are involved in collateralised stock lending transactions as an intermediary between counterparties.
Although the legal form of such transactions is that the securities broker acts as principal on both sides of the transaction, the substance of the transaction is that the Group companies involved act as intermediaries and assume minimal risk.
Accordingly, the deposits paid and received for securities borrowed and loaned have been offset and only the net amount is included in debtors.
For information purposes, the gross amounts are disclosed in note 16. l Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
The net realisable value for the listed investment is based upon the readily ascertainable market price.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2004 46 m Pension costs Defined contribution pension costs charged to the profit and loss account represent employers contributions payable in respect of the year.
Defined benefit pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the service lives of the eligible employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees.
To the extent that such costs do not equate with cash contributions, a provision or prepayment is recognised in the balance sheet.
Certain assumptions and estimates are made in order to value the Groups defined benefit pension schemes and these are disclosed in note 27. n Employee share ownership trusts Investments in own shares held in connection with the Groups employee share schemes are deducted from shareholders funds in accordance with UITF 38 until such time as they vest unconditionally to the participating employees.
For share option schemes without Inland Revenue approval, any excess of the cost of the shares to the trust over the exercise price of the options granted over them is amortised to the profit and loss account over the period of service in respect of which the participating employees are awarded the options.
For share options schemes with Inland Revenue approval, the excess of the cost of the shares to the trust over the exercise price of the options granted over them is written off to reserves as permitted under UITF 17 Employee share schemes.
The cost of shares purchased to satisfy the basic award options to the executive directors in respect of the BSMP is charged to the profit and loss account in the year to which the performance relates.
The cost of matching options awarded to executive directors is amortised to the profit and loss account over three years from the date of grant.
o Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised as an asset or a liability if transactions have occurred at the balance sheet date which give rise to a right to pay less taxation in the future or an obligation to pay more taxation in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted or where they can be offset against deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recognised are not discounted.
No provision is made in respect of any further taxation liability that would arise on the distribution of retained earnings of overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associates.
p Foreign currencies At entity level, transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on the date the transaction is recorded.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
On consolidation, the results of overseas businesses are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the year and their assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translating the net assets and liabilities of overseas businesses and, to the extent permitted by SSAP 20 Foreign currency translation, exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings taken out to hedge investments in overseas businesses are taken directly to reserves.
In the cash flow statement, cash flows denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the average exchange rate for the year.
q Financial instruments Foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures both on assets and liabilities recognised in the Financial Statements and forecast receipts and payments denominated in foreign currencies.
Gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are offset against the exchange differences arising on the hedged assets and liabilities.
Where a contract is a hedge against future transactions, gains and losses on the contract are deferred until the transaction is recognised in the Financial Statements.
Underlying principal amounts and unrecognised gains and losses of financial instruments used for hedging purposes outstanding at 31 March 2004 are disclosed in note 22 to the Financial Statements.
r Debt provisioning Provisions are made for specific debts when it is considered that the credit-worthiness of the debtor has deteriorated such that the recovery of all or part of a debt is in serious doubt.
A general provision is made in respect of potential losses which are judged to be present in debtor balances at the balance sheet date, but which will not be identified as such until some time in the future.
The level of provision is based upon the previous experience of such losses in the Group and is reviewed on a periodic basis.
The accuracy of the provision is periodically assessed against any actual losses that have arisen.
All provisions are recorded within operating expenses in the profit and loss account.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2004 47 Notes to the Financial Statements 2 Segmental information In order to reflect its increasing significance to the Group, the analysis by activity has been expanded to show energy broking as a separate business segment.
Energy broking was formerly included within derivatives and money broking and the comparatives have been restated accordingly.
The business of Intercontinental Energy Brokers was merged with the business of ICAP Energy in London after acquisition.
As a result it is not practicable to identify the post-acquisition results or net assets of the acquired business, so the results of the merged business have been included within continuing operations.
There is no material difference between the turnover by origin and turnover by destination.

The Groups share of taxation of joint ventures is 1.7m 2003 - 1.9m and of associates is 1.3m 2003 - 1.1m.
The adjustment to overseas taxation for prior years includes 7.5m resulting from a change in the tax year end of the US operations, aligning it to its financial year end.
This has created a movement from current tax to deferred tax.
ICAP plc Annual Report 2004 54 The Groups UK tax charge for the year ended 31 March 2004 exceeds the UK statutory rate and can be reconciled as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2004 2003 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 130.5 117.5 Profit on ordinary activities at the standard rate of Corporation Tax in the UK of 30.0% 2003 - 30.0% 39.2 35.3 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 15.8 7.0 Additional tax deductible items not in the profit and loss account 5.1 3.3 Surplus of book depreciation over tax depreciation 0.4 3.9 Other timing differences 1.7 0.4 Adjustments in respect of foreign tax rates 1.2 3.5 Adjustment to tax in respect of prior year 10.5 1.5 Adjustments in respect of joint ventures and associates 0.8 1.0 Other 0.1 0.3 Current taxation charge 64.6 37.4 10 Dividends Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2004 2003 Dividends in respect of ordinary shares: m m Interim dividend of 1.7p per 10p ordinary share 2003 - 1.4p per share 9.6 7.0 Final dividend proposed of 5.7p per 10p ordinary share 2003 - 4.6p per share 32.5 23.3 Adjustment to dividend declared in prior year 2.8 - 44.9 30.3 The adjustment of 2.8m relates to the additional final dividend paid for the year ended 31 March 2003 in respect of the initial shares issued following the completion of the BrokerTec acquisition in May 2003.
The right to receive dividends has been waived in respect of shares held in employee trusts.
11 Earnings per 10p ordinary share Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the financial year of 84.5m 2003 - 76.8m by the weighted average number of ordinary 10p shares in issue during the year of 561.4m shares 2003 - 498.5m.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue excludes the weighted average number of shares held by trusts relating to employee share schemes to which the participating employees are not unconditionally entitled, being 8.3m shares 2003 - 5.0m.
Diluted earnings per share takes into account the dilutive effect of share options outstanding under the Companys employee share schemes note 24 and the dilutive effect of contingent share capital note 25.

During the year, the Company acquired ICAP America Investments Limited, a financing company, from a fellow subsidiary undertaking for 141.4m.
It also increased its investment in Garban Group Holdings Limited by 5.7m.
15 Acquisitions a BrokerTec On 7 May 2003 the Group completed the acquisition of BrokerTecs fixed income securities businesses by the issue of an initial 59,947,545 ordinary shares of 10p each in ICAP valued at 117.3m.
Further shares are to be issued after the first full 12 months following acquisition, the final number of which will be dependent upon the revenues earned by the acquired business and ETC, ICAPs existing electronic trading platform, in certain products in the first full 12 calendar months following completion.
At 31 March 2004 it is estimated that the further shares to be issued will be the maximum number of 33,720,495.
These were valued at 96.1m on 31 March 2004 and in accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting have been included as contingent share capital note 25.
The total goodwill of 189.3m arising on the acquisition is stated after fair value adjustments of 2.3m and is being amortised over ten years.

ICAP plc Annual Report 2004 58 The last audited accounts for BrokerTec prior to acquisition were for the year ended 31 December 2002.
In order to provide a meaningful comparison with the business acquired, a number of adjustments are required principally to exclude the futures business that was not acquired by the Group and to eliminate transaction costs related to the acquisition.
On this basis, profit before tax for the year ended 31 December 2002 was 13.6m.
The profit is presented before tax since no taxation charge was included in the accounts of BrokerTec and no meaningful allocation can be made.
The results of BrokerTec for the period immediately prior to acquisition from 1 January 2003 to 6 May 2003 are shown below.
They have also been adjusted as above and the profit is presented before tax.
There were no other recognised gains and losses for the period other than as shown below.
BrokerTec m Turnover 21.2 Operating expenses 17.7 Profit before taxation 3.5 b Other acquisitions In June 2003 the Group acquired the business of Intercontinental Energy Brokers Limited for 4.9m.
The Group did not acquire any assets of the business and the resulting goodwill of 4.9m is being amortised over seven years.
In February 2004 the Group acquired the business of Ried, Thunberg & Co. Inc. a bond market strategy and analysis firm for total consideration of 0.3m all of which is goodwill.
During the year the Group also acquired the remaining 12.5% of Garban Praha AS that it did not previously own for 0.3m, of which goodwill represented 0.2m.
c Contingent consideration in respect of acquisitions for the year ended 31 March 2003 In the year to 31 March 2003, the Group completed a number of acquisitions, to be satisfied in part by deferred consideration.
In accordance with FRS 7 Fair values in acquisition accounting the Group has re-estimated the deferred contingent consideration, with corresponding adjustments being made to goodwill.
The deferred contingent consideration for both First Brokers and ICAP Energy formerly APB includes amounts payable in either cash or shares at the Groups option.
In accordance with FRS 7, such amounts have been included as contingent share capital.
On 15 April 2003, the board resolved not to exercise its option to satisfy the first deferred contingent consideration instalment in respect of the First Brokers acquisition in shares and consequently it was paid in cash in May 2003.
In June 2003 the Group paid the second instalment of the initial cash payment in respect of the acquisition of ICAP Energy.
In November 2003 the Group paid the second and final cash instalment due for the acquired Asian businesses.

Accordingly there has been a reduction in the contingent share capital.
Further adjustments have been made to contingent share capital as a result of the re-estimation of the contingent consideration due for First Brokers and ICAP Energy note 15.
The charge to the profit and loss account of 1.5m relates to amounts charged directly to reserves when employees exercised their share options under the UESOP and SAYE schemes.
As at 31 March 2004, the cumulative amount of goodwill written off directly to reserves, net of goodwill relating to acquired businesses which subsequently have been sold, amounted to 270.6m 2003 - 270.6m.
The net book value of shares held by employee trusts of 3.9m 2003 - 2.2m has been deducted from the profit and loss reserve.
As at 31 March 2004, these shares had a market value of 23.2m 2003 - 14.9m.

27 Defined benefit pension schemes The Group has followed the transitional arrangements allowed by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits which only requires disclosure of the asset or liability that would have been recognised in the balance sheet if the standard had been fully implemented.
The Group operates defined benefit pension schemes in the US and Germany.
In the case of the schemes operating in Germany, any future obligations that the Group may incur in respect of benefits accrued to members in respect of past service are insured with local insurance companies.
The scheme in Germany is not significant in the context of the Group.
The US scheme was closed to new entrants on 1 July 1996 and no benefits have accrued to the members of the scheme in respect of their service after that date.
For the purposes of determining the Groups pension cost, the scheme is valued on an annual basis by qualified independent actuaries.
The most recent valuation was as at 1 January 2003 with an update as at 31 March 2004 which used the projected unit method.

The Group has rejected the claim and in January 2004 the United States court for the district of Delaware denied the claimants request for a preliminary injunction.
The action continues and is expected to be heard in 2005.
On 27 May 2004, a co-defendant announced that as part of the court proceedings the claimant has now stated its damage claims against the defendants, including the Group, to be an amount of up to $64m as of 31 March 2004.
At this stage it is not possible to predict the outcome with certainty or to determine the extent of liability, if any, of the Group, but based on current available information and after consultation with the Groups lawyers the directors continue to expect a successful outcome for the Group.
No provision has been made in the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 March 2004. b From time to time the Group is engaged in litigation on employee related and other matters.
It is not possible to quantify the extent of such liabilities but they are not expected to have a material, adverse effect on the Groups results or net assets.
c In the normal course of business, certain Group undertakings enter into guarantees to cover trading arrangements.
