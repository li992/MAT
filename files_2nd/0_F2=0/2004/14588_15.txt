A tax liability has been recognised on dividends received in the UK from EU-based subsidiaries on the basis of current UK tax legislation.
This is currently the subject of a group litigation order that is expected to be heard during 2005 and which may be referred to the European Court of Justice.
In view of the uncertainties regarding the final outcome of the court proceedings and taking into account current UK tax law, a liability has been recognised.
In the event that current UK law is overturned, no tax will be due.
A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of brought forward Danish losses following agreement as to their quantum and basis with the tax authorities and in light of the Danish operations current and expected performance.
