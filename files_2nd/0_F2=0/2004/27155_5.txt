Revenue returns per Ordinary share have been based on the average number of Ordinary shares during each year see note 7 on page 43.
Net Asset Values per Ordinary and B Ordinary share have been calculated after deducting prior capital at nominal values and have been adjusted for the annual B Ordinary shares scrip issues.
As at 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003 there were no B Ordinary shares in issue.
"The figures for years prior to 1996 have not been re-stated to reflect the changes in relation to the Statement of Recommended Practice ""Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies""."
"The revenue figures for the years prior to 1999 have not been restated to reflect the changes in relation to Financial Reporting Standard 16 ""Current Tax"", and have been shown gross."
The 1999 dividend per share does not include the special component of 0.75p to compensate for lack of tax credit on the first interim dividend.
The total expense ratio is calculated on the net asset value at the year end.
