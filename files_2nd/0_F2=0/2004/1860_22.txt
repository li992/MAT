Any liabilities are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance, reserves and third party indemnities.
Additionally, the Group has previously owned businesses that manufactured products containing asbestos.
No BBA company has manufactured or sold any products or materials containing asbestos for many years.
A small number of former BBA companies have been named as defendants to asbestos related claims.
When these companies were sold, BBA retained certain obligations to indemnify the purchasers against such claims.
Notwithstanding such indemnity arrangements, the costs incurred by BBA in dealing with claims made against these former BBA companies have been immaterial to BBA.
During the period 1989 to 31 December 2004, BBA's costs of defending and disposing of all asbestos related claims, net of insurance coverage, were approximately 3.2m.
BBA maintains a portfolio of insurance coverage in respect of the majority of such claims, including legal defence costs and liability cover.
State operated compensation programmes have also provided coverage.
On the basis of its past claims experience, BBA does not anticipate any material increase in the cost to it of resolving such claims.
The directors do not currently anticipate that the outcome of the proceedings and claims set out above either individually, or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
25 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS During the year a subsidiary provided services to a company controlled by a person who is a close family member of Roberto Quarta, a director of BBA Group plc.
These were provided in the ordinary course of business and on an arms length basis and amounted to 12,572 2003: 5,318.
