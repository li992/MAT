34 34 Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified for the revaluation of certain assets, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
The Groups earnings stream is primarily US dollars and the functional currency is the US dollar.
The reporting currency is also the US dollar.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 from presenting its own profit and loss account.
The accounts have been prepared on the same basis and using the same accounting policies as those used to prepare the financial statements of the Lonmin Group for the year ended 30 September 2003 with the exception of the implementation of the provisions of Urgent Issues Task Force UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts, and related amendments to UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes as detailed in note 24 to the accounts.
Turnover Turnover represents sales of goods and services outside the Group net of discounts and allowances and value added tax and includes commissions earned.
Turnover is recorded when the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the purchaser.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consist of the results for the year ended 30 September 2004 and the assets and liabilities of the Company and its subsidiaries as at that date.
The results of subsidiaries are included from the date of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries sold are included up to the date of sale.
Goodwill On the acquisition of a company or business, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Where the fair value of the purchase consideration differs from the aggregate of these fair values, purchased goodwill arises.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 October 1998 is capitalised and amortised over its useful life in accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
Prior to 1 October 1998, goodwill was charged to reserves in the year of acquisition as a matter of accounting policy and, in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 10, goodwill has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10.
No goodwill arose during the year.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired company or business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging or crediting the amount of any related goodwill previously charged to reserves or capitalised and not yet charged to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable and also at the end of the first complete financial year following an acquisition in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill.
Associates Investments in associates are accounted for under the equity accounting method.
An associate is a company, other than a subsidiary, in which the Groups interest is considered to be long-term and is substantial and over which the Group exercises a significant influence.
Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2004 35 1 Statement on accounting policies continued The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the results of associates.
The carrying value of associates in the Groups balance sheet comprises the Groups share of the net assets of associates.
Any goodwill arising on acquisition of associates is included within investments in associates and is written off over its useful economic life.
Joint arrangements The Group has certain contractual arrangements with other participants to engage in joint activities that do not create an entity carrying on a trade or business of its own.
The Group includes its share of the assets, liabilities and cash flows in such joint arrangements, measured in accordance with the terms of each arrangement, which is usually pro-rata to the Groups interest in the joint arrangement.
Other investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairments or at Directors valuations.
During the year the Group sold its investment in AngloGold Ashanti.
Foreign currencies Subsidiaries that keep their accounts in currencies other than their functional currency remeasure them into the functional currency by the temporal method prior to consolidation.
This results in non-monetary assets and liabilities being recorded at their historical cost expressed in the functional currency whilst monetary assets and liabilities are stated at the closing exchange rate.
Differences on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The principal US dollar exchange rates used in the financial statements, expressed as the foreign currency value of one US dollar, are as follows: 2004 2003 Average exchange rates: Sterling 0.56 0.62 South African rand 6.60 7.90 Zimbabwe dollar 1,000.00 Closing exchange rates: Sterling 0.55 0.60 South African rand 6.48 6.97 Zimbabwe dollar 1,000.00 Note: The Zimbabwe dollar exchange rate for 2003 is applicable for the month of October 2002 only up to the date of disposal of the gold mining interests.
Exploration costs Exploration expenditure is analysed between its three constituent parts and accounted for as follows: a Replacement exploration This is defined as expenditure necessary to delineate and quantify the reserves and resources required to replace those extracted in any one accounting period, and as such is an operating cost which is expensed as incurred.
36 36 Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Accounts 1 Statement on accounting policies continued b Expansion and new opportunities exploration Within or adjacent to a producing unit: These costs are expensed until a probable reserve has been defined and confirmed by a Competent Person.
At that point further costs are capitalised and the asset amortised over the estimated life of mine.
Greenfields or Brownfields: These costs are expensed until an indicated resource has been defined and confirmed by a Competent Person.
At that point further costs are capitalised.
Amortisation commences in the first year of production after which amortisation is provided over the estimated life of the project.
Research and development Research and development costs, separate to exploration expenditure, are accounted for in accordance with SSAP 13 Accounting for research and development, and expenditure is written off in the period in which it arises.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are recorded at cost or valuation, which are not updated under the transitional arrangements of FRS 15 Tangible fixed assets, less depreciation.
Depreciation on fixed assets is provided on a straight line or units of production basis, as appropriate.
Assets are depreciated over their estimated useful economic lives, or over the remaining life of the mine, if shorter, to residual value.
The life of a mine is based on proven and probable reserves.
Depreciation rates for the principal assets of the Group are as follows: Shafts and underground 2.6% 20% per annum Metallurgical 2.7% 16.7% per annum Infrastructure 2.7% 20% per annum Other mining assets and equipment, plant and motor vehicles 2.7% 33.3% per annum No depreciation is provided on surface mining land which has a continuing value and capital work in progress.
Tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by reference to the net present value of expected future cash flows of the relevant income generating unit or disposal value if higher in accordance with FRS 11.
Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised and the outstanding future lease obligations are shown in borrowings.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Capitalised interest Tangible fixed assets include directly attributable finance costs which are capitalised gross of tax during the period of construction.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost which includes the applicable proportion of production overheads and net realisable value.
PGMs stock is valued by allocating costs to platinum, palladium and rhodium stock based on the annual cost of production, less revenue from byproducts, apportioned according to the quantities of each of the three main metals produced.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided for on timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date on a non-discounted basis.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2004 37 1 Statement on accounting policies continued Pension costs and other post-retirement benefits The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes in accordance with local regulations.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group and are administered by trustees.
Independent actuaries prepare valuations of these schemes at least every three years and in accordance with their recommendations the Group makes contributions which are charged to profits on a systematic basis over the expected remaining working lives of the employees.
Any differences between the actuarial valuation of the obligation and the value of assets in a scheme are similarly charged or credited to profit before taxation over the expected remaining working lives of employees in the scheme.
The cost of defined contribution schemes is charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Certain Group companies provided post-retirement medical benefits to qualifying pensioners.
The expected costs of these benefits were charged to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining service lives of the relevant employees and were assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
Under the transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, additional disclosures are included for pension and other retirement benefits as disclosed in note 26 to the accounts.
Rehabilitation costs Group companies are generally required to restore mine and processing sites at the end of their producing lives to a condition acceptable to the relevant authorities.
Such costs are provided for in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets, so that rehabilitation costs are provided in full based on the best estimates of the future costs to be incurred, calculated on a discounted basis.
As the provision is recognised, it is either capitalised as part of the cost of the related mine or written off to the profit and loss account.
Where costs are capitalised the impact of such costs on the profit and loss account is spread over the life of the mine through the accretion of the discount of the provision and the depreciation over a units of production basis of the increased costs of the mining assets.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Examples of where such estimates are made include the valuation of pension schemes assets and liabilities where discount, inflation and return rate assumptions are made and in the calculation of rehabilitation liabilities which involves projecting expected liabilities forward to the end lives of the mines using an assumed inflation rate and discounting these liabilities back to the present day using an assumed discount rate.

All cash dividends are paid to the Registrars who use the dividends of participants in the plan to fund these purchases.

The principal activity of Incwala Resources is the ownership of platinum mining assets in South Africa and its financial year end is 30 September.
The investment in associate of $4 million shown above in 2003 represented an investment of 44% in the ordinary share capital of Platinum Australia Limited, a company incorporated in Australia.
This investment was reduced to 38% during the year and on 30 September 2004 it was transferred to fixed asset investments following the resignation of Lonmin representatives from the board of Platinum Australia.
The Group no longer exercises significant influence over the operating and financial policies of Platinum Australia and it is the Groups intention to realise this investment.
These factors rebut the presumption that a holding of 20% or more should be presumed to exercise a significant influence and consequently this holding is now included as a fixed asset investment.

These indemnities fall into two categories as follows: 1 Vendor financing indemnity Lonmin has agreed to indemnify Impala against any non-payment on the relevant due date of any principal amount owing to Impala by any HDSA historically disadvantaged South African investor in relation to loans made by Impala to HDSA investors for their purchase of shares in EPL and WPL.
The value of this indemnity is the rand equivalent of $95 million of which $68 million expires on 30 September 2009 and $27 million expires on 30 September 2011.
A counter-indemnity given by each HDSA investor exists against this contingent liability.
2 IDC investment in Incwala Lonmin has agreed to indemnify the IDC up to the value of its investment in Incwala the rand equivalent of $82 million in relation to warranties provided by each of EPL and WPL.
This contingent liability falls away on 30 September 2007.

These options, which amount to $15 million, can be put upon Lonmin by the banks in the event that the HDSAs default on payment.
There were no contingent liabilities outstanding in respect of litigation.
A contingent asset exists regarding a claim lodged in respect of the smelter explosion which occurred during 2002.
It is estimated that some refund will be received but the quantity and timing are uncertain.

23 Share Incentive Schemes Share options The grant of all options is made by the Remuneration Committee.
Exercises of options granted under The Lonmin Share Option Scheme 1994 and The Lonmin Executive Share Option Scheme are normally subject to the attainment of the performance condition that, over any consecutive three year period starting not earlier than the first day of the month in which the option is granted, the total return to shareholders is greater than the total return during the same period on, i the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index, for options granted prior to 1998, and ii the Mining formerly Extractive Industries Sector of the FTSE Actuaries Share Indices, for options granted from 1998.
The method of calculation of the total return to shareholders is the same method as used to calculate the total return figures published in the Financial Times for the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index and Mining Sector Indices.
This method assumes that the dividends which the Company pays during the period are reinvested in its shares and takes account of the increase in the Companys share price.
During the year options were granted over 22,787 shares of the Company at a subscription price of 840 pence 1,520 cents under The Lonmin Savings Related Share Option Scheme 1994.

UITF Abstract 38 changes the presentation of an entitys own shares held in an employee share ownership plan ESOP by requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholders funds instead of showing them as an asset.
Accordingly, the prior years balance sheet has been restated to show the net book value of the shares held in the Lonmin ESOP of $3 million as at 30 September 2003 as a deduction from shareholders funds instead of as a fixed asset investment.
UITF Abstract 17 revised 2003 requires the expenses of shares held in an ESOP to be based on the intrinsic value of the shares being the difference between the fair value at the date the shares are awarded and the amount an employee is required to pay for the shares.
The effect of this change of accounting policy on the profit and loss account is $nil and the cumulative amortisation at 30 September 2003 of $2 million has not been affected.
At 30 September 2004 the Groups ESOP held 470,362 shares 2003 346,000 shares with a market value at that date of $9 million 2003 $5 million.
The book value of the ESOP, which continues to be shown as a deduction to the profit and loss account, amounted to $7 million at 30 September 2004.
The purpose of the trust is to retain key employees within the Group.
The shares were purchased in the open market and funded by Lonmin Plc.

The total pension cost for the Group from continuing operations was $20 million 2003 $14 million, $18 million of which related to overseas schemes 2003 $13 million.
The overseas schemes were all defined contribution plans and the active UK scheme was a defined benefit scheme.
There were no accrued obligations under defined contribution plans.
Lonmin Plc Annual Report 2004 55 26 Pension costs continued The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24 Pension costs and the disclosures given in a are those required by the standard.
FRS 17 Retirement benefits was issued in November 2000 but is not required to be fully adopted by the Group until the year ended 30 September 2006.
Transitional disclosures do, however, apply and have been detailed in b. a SSAP 24 Disclosures In the United Kingdom, there are two defined benefit schemes, the Lonmin Superannuation Scheme the LSS scheme and the Scottish and Universal Investments Scheme the SUITS scheme.
The LSS scheme applies to the current employees of the Group whereas the SUITS scheme has no active members as it relates to pensioners and deferred pensioners of former subsidiaries of the Group.
The LSS Scheme The pension costs relating to the LSS scheme have been assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries based on a valuation conducted on 1 October 2002.
At this date, the market value of the United Kingdom scheme assets, in aggregate, was the equivalent of $122 million translated at the appropriate year end exchange rate.
Assets of the pension schemes were sufficient to cover 108 per cent of the benefits accruing to the members.
The United Kingdom pension charge has been assessed using the attained age method as approved under SSAP 24 with the following principal growth rate assumptions: Investment return 5 6% per annum Rate of increase in salaries 3.5% per annum Rates of increases in pensions in payment 2.5% per annum The SUITS Scheme During September 2004, it was agreed to secure members benefits in the SUITS pension scheme by purchasing annuities for all the remaining members.
A contribution of $42 million was made of which $41 million had been settled by 30 September 2004 as settlement of all outstanding obligations.
This has been shown within discontinued operations.
The Overseas Schemes In respect of overseas schemes, pension costs have been determined in accordance with the latest actuarial advice where practicable and otherwise in accordance with local regulations.
The Group provided healthcare benefits for qualifying pensioners in South Africa during the year.
These liabilities were settled during September 2004 as disclosed in note 20 to the accounts.
