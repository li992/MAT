The effective interest rates of the loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings as at 31 December 2004 were between 0% and 9.95% 2003 0% and 9.95%.
The maturity profile of the non-interest bearing financial assets, being primarily loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings, cannot be practicably estimated as repayments are based on the performance of the individual joint venture or associated undertaking.
The interest rates on those Group financial assets and liabilities which are at floating rates are determined mainly by the prevailing London Interbank Offered Rate LIBOR for the relevant currency and maturity at the time of determination plus or minus an agreed margin.

The amounts actually exchanged are based upon all the terms of the derivatives, including interest rates, exchange rates and notional amounts.
The value of the derivatives is based upon these underlying parameters and changes in the relevant rates or prices.

The fair value of the fixed rate borrowings and joint venture and associated undertaking loans has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices.
The fair value of floating rate borrowings and joint venture and associated undertaking loans approximates book value as interest rates on these instruments reset on a frequent basis.
Fair values have not been obtained for the non-interest bearing loans to joint ventures and associated undertakings as repayment of these loans is linked to the performance of the individual joint venture or associated undertaking and it is therefore not practicable to assign fair values.
The amount for cash-settled commodity contracts represents the Groups estimated liability based on forward price curves for a number of gas and oil contracts.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures in the table above.

Provision is made for the estimated cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date.
The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain but are currently anticipated to be between 2005 and 2041.
During 2004 BG Group completed a full review of its exploration and production decommissioning liabilities.
PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT COSTS Pension costs represent the difference between the charge or credit to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and the contributions to the pension schemes see Principal Accounting Policies, page 62 and note 28, page 95.
Post-retirement costs relate to a healthcare plan in respect of Comgas.
The provision is being amortised over the expected future life of remaining employees.
DEFERRED PETROLEUM REVENUE TAX 91 The provision for tax on gas and oil activities is calculated on a unit of production basis and represents liabilities expected to crystallise on certain North Sea fields.
The first payment is expected to be made in 2005.
The calculation is based upon estimated remaining production of 96 mmboe.
DEFERRED CORPORATION TAX This represents the provision for the tax attributable to timing differences between profits and losses compiled for tax purposes and results as stated in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is provided for in full on certain timing differences.
The provision has been calculated as follows: 2004 2003 m m Accelerated capital allowances 793 804 Other timing differences 110 116 683 688 In the event of the distribution of the unappropriated profits or reserves of certain overseas subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings, additional liabilities to UK and overseas tax of approximately 235m 2003 231m might arise.
Such potential deferred tax liabilities have not been provided because it is currently not intended to remit the profits.

It is exempt approved and established under Trust.
The Trustee is BG Group Pension Trustees Limited.
The Scheme is funded to cover future pension liabilities in respect of service up to the balance sheet date.
It is subject to an independent valuation at least every three years, on the basis of which the independent qualified actuary certifies the rate of employers contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds from the Schemes assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the Scheme.
Employees contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 3% of pensionable pay.
Participating employers contributions, including Scheme expenses, are certified by the Schemes independent qualified actuary.
For the year ended 31 December 2004, the employers contribution rate was 19.9% of pensionable pay.
Higher paid employees may be subject to the earnings cap which is a restriction on the amount of pay which can be used to calculate pensions 95 from a tax approved pension scheme.
The Company has agreed that on becoming capped, employees may, at the Companys discretion, be offered membership of the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme, an unfunded, unapproved arrangement under which their benefits including contingent death benefits would be increased to at least the level that would otherwise have been provided under the BG Pension Scheme had they not been subject to an earnings cap.

The financial assumptions used in this valuation are as follows: Valuation 31 Mar 2002 % Rate of price inflation and pensions increase 2.5 Discount rate for Schemes accrued liabilities 6.1 Future increases in pensionable pay 4.5 Discount rate for future service costs 7.0 The independent actuarial valuation showed that the aggregate market value of the Schemes assets as at 31 March 2002 was 241m, representing some 99% of the accrued liabilities in respect of BG Group employees on the assumptions set out above.
The level of employers contributions from 1 January 2003 was revised to adjust the funding level on a straight-line basis to 100% over time.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 28 PENSIONS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued The last independent actuarial review of the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme was undertaken as at 30 June 2002 based on salary and service at the date of valuation with no allowance for future salary increases, reflecting the expected cost of purchasing annuity policies to cover the schemes accrued liabilities with an insurance company.
This showed that the aggregate value of the schemes assets was 7m, which represented 122% of the schemes accrued liabilities.
During 2004, a number of members of the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme transferred into the Scheme.
This resulted in a transfer of cash from the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme to the Scheme of 6m.
The costs of the Scheme, assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, together with unfunded and other schemes benefit costs and the reconciliation to the balance sheet provision, were as follows: 2004 2003 m m Regular benefit cost 25 27 Amortisation of surplus 5 6 20 21 Interest on balance sheet provision 3 4 Net benefit charge 23 25 Contributions paid 20 23 Foreign exchange movements 1 Movement in provision 3 3 Balance sheet provision as at 1 January 73 70 Balance sheet provision as at 31 December see note 23, page 90 76 73 The regular benefit cost for the year ended 31 December 2004 includes 6m 2003 10m in respect of payments made for pension curtailments on redundancy, 5m 2003 5m of which has been provided in prior years as part of a restructuring provision see note 23, page 90.

Following this valuation the rate of employers contributions will be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.
US GAAP Calculations in respect of the US GAAP pension disclosures for the BG Pension Scheme, the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme and the BG Supplementary Benefits Scheme for the years ended 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 have been prepared using a measurement date of 31 December.
For 2002, as permitted by Financial Accounting Standard FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, calculations in respect of US GAAP pension disclosures have been prepared using a measurement date of 30 September.
The 31 December measurement date more accurately reflects the plans funded status and net periodic pension cost for each year presented and provides a more useful comparison with the disclosures prepared under the UK accounting standard FRS 17.
The change in measurement date in 2003 did not have a material impact on the numbers presented under FAS 87.
The long-term assumptions used in accounting for pension costs under US GAAP see note 30, page 102 were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Expected long-term rate of return on assets 7.5 7.5 7.7 98 Rate of pension increase 2.8 2.7 2.3 Rate of salary increase 4.8 4.7 4.3 Discount rate 5.3 5.4 5.5 The expected long-term rate of return on assets has been determined following advice from the plans independent actuary and is based on the expected return on each asset class together with consideration of the long-term asset strategy.
The percentage of fair value of total assets in the plan for each major category of assets for the BG Pension Scheme and the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme is set out in the FRS 17 disclosure on page 96.
The Trustees of the pension plans are responsible for setting the investment strategy after consultation with the Company and professional advisors.
The Trustees consider that an appropriate strategy is achieved by adopting the following asset allocation as a benchmark for the BG Pension Scheme: an equity bond split of 85 15: within equities, a UK overseas split of 40 60: and within bonds, an index-linked fixed interest split of 30 70.
In addition, the Trustees have undertaken to ensure that there is sufficient investment in liquid or readily realisable assets to meet cash flow requirements so that the overall investment policy is not disrupted.
Assets of the Ballylumford Power Pension Scheme are invested in index-linked gilts.
