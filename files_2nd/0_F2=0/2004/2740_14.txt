In India and Bangladesh absolute title to any hydrocarbon reserves is vested in the host government.
However, under the terms of the PSCs, Cairn is entitled to receive a share of the hydrocarbon production and associated revenues.
Group reserves have therefore been presented both on a direct entitlement basis and a direct working interest basis.
The direct entitlement basis takes into account projections of government share of production calculated in accordance with certain price and expenditure assumptions.
Entitlement interest reserves are utilised for unit of production basis calculations in the financial statements.
Direct working interest basis is Cairns share of production calculated by reference to our joint venture participating interest as shown in the Principal Licence Interests on page 48.
Sales of reserves in place relate to the disposal of the Groups UK asset 10% interest in Gryphon during the year.
Acquisition of reserves in place relates to the purchase of Shells upstream interests in Bangladesh.
The development plans for Mangala and Aishwariya have yet to be finalised and so the associated Rajasthan reserves have been disclosed but not been booked in the year end financial statements.
