Notes to the accounts For the period ended 30 December 2004 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK law and accounting standards and, except for the non-depreciation of investment properties referred to below, with the Companies Act 1985.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of properties, using the following principal accounting policies.
These have been applied consistently.
These financial statements have been prepared for the period ended 30 December 2004.
The directors do not believe there has been a material effect on profit from the change in year end.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Capital & Regional plc and its consolidated entities, associated companies and joint ventures for the period ended 30 December 2004.
Where necessary, the financial statements of associated companies and joint ventures are adjusted to conform with the Groups accounting policies.
Subsidiaries have been consolidated under the acquisition method of accounting and the results of companies acquired during the period are included from the date of acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill, being the difference between the cost of businesses acquired and the fair value of their separate net assets, is included in the balance 1 sheet as an intangible asset and is amortised over its useful economic life.
Goodwill is amortised over 12 2 years, on a straight-line basis.
Joint ventures and associates In accordance with FRS 9, Associates and joint ventures, joint ventures are included in the accounts under the gross equity method of accounting, and associates under the net equity method.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost or valuation, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than investment properties and long leasehold land, over their expected useful lives: Long leasehold buildings over 50 years, on a straight-line basis.
Fixtures and fittings over three to five years, on a straight-line basis.
Motor vehicles over four years, on a straight-line basis.
Investment properties Investment properties are included in the financial statements at valuation less any unamortised tenant incentives.
The aggregate surplus or temporary deficit below cost arising from such valuations is transferred to a revaluation reserve.
Deficits that are considered to be permanent are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Groups policy is to value investment properties twice a year.
On realisation, any gain or loss is calculated by reference to the carrying value at the last financial year-end balance sheet date and is included in the profit and loss account.
Any balance in the revaluation reserve is transferred to the profit and loss reserve.
In accordance with SSAP 19, Accounting for investment properties, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years unexpired.
The Companies Act 1985 requires all properties to be depreciated, but that requirement conflicts with the generally accepted principle set out in SSAP 19.
Depreciation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation of properties and the amount of depreciation or amortisation, which might otherwise have been charged, cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Owner occupied long leasehold properties Owner occupied long leasehold properties are included in the financial statement at valuation less any unamortised tenant incentives.
The Groups policy is to value owner occupied long leasehold properties twice a year.
On realisation any gain or loss is calculated by reference to the carrying value at the last financial year-end balance sheet date and is included in the profit and loss account.
Capital & Regional 43 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies continued Properties under development Interest and directly attributable internal and external costs incurred during the period of development are capitalised.
Interest is capitalised gross before deduction of related tax relief.
Interest is calculated on the development expenditure by reference to specific borrowings where relevant.
A property ceases to be treated as being under development when substantially all activities that are necessary to get the property ready for use are complete.
Refurbishment expenditure Refurbishment expenditure in respect of major works is capitalised.
Renovation and refurbishment expenditure of a revenue nature is written off as incurred.
Property transactions Acquisitions and disposals are accounted for at the date of legal completion.
Properties are transferred between categories at the estimated market value on the transfer date.
Current property assets Properties held with the intention of disposal and properties held for development are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tenant incentives Lease incentives which enhance the property are added to the cost of properties.
Where a lease incentive does not enhance the property, it is amortised over the period to the earlier of the first rent review, the first break option, or the end of the lease term.
On new leases with rentfree periods, rental income is allocated evenly over the period from the date of the lease commencement to the date of the first rent review.
Loan arrangement costs Costs relating to the raising of general corporate loan facilities and loan stock are amortised over the estimated life of the loan and charged to the profit and loss account as part of the interest expense.
The bank loans and loan stock are disclosed net of unamortised loan issue costs.
Operating leases Annual rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Current taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred tax, on all timing differences which have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
On disposal of a property, any provision for deferred tax no longer required will be released to the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax is not provided on revaluation gains unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the assets, and the gain or loss arising on sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Pension costs Pension liabilities, all of which relate to defined contribution schemes, are charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which they accrue.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP For share schemes that contingently award shares at no cost to the participant, a charge is recognised systematically in the profit and loss account over the LTIP performance period based on the directors estimate of the extent that the related performance criteria will be met, with a corresponding credit in the profit and loss reserve.
44 Capital & Regional 1 Accounting policies continued Own shares In accordance with UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP trusts own shares held by the Group are shown as a deduction from shareholders funds, and included in other reserves.
The cost of own shares is transferred from other reserves to the profit and loss reserve systematically over the LTIP performance period.
Performance fees Performance fees relating to the performance period 1 January 2002 to 30 December 2004 have been credited to the profit and loss account for the current year, and will be received on 1 December 2005.
