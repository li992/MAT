These guidelines identify a number of categories of work where the auditors will not normally be employed, including financial due diligence assignments on potential acquisitions and financial systems consultancy.
The Audit Committee has also put in place procedures for the pre-approval of any fees payable to the auditors for those non-audit services which fall within the policy guidelines.
Professional firms are selected to provide advisory services on the basis of their relevant experience and expertise.
For major projects, it is the groups policy to undertake a competitive tendering process.
In certain circumstances, for example reasons of confidentiality or knowledge of the groups businesses and structures, it is appropriate to employ the groups auditors to provide such services without a competitive tender being undertaken.

For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The group has two categories of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the companys ordinary shares during the year and shares attributable to convertible debt.
No adjustment has been made for the dilutive impact in 2003 as this would decrease reported loss per share.
The impact of dilutive securities in 2004 would be to increase the profit by 3.5 million for convertible debt 2003: 3.7 million and to increase weighted average shares by 4.6 million shares for employee share options 2003: 2.6 million and 47.8 million shares for convertible debt 2003: 47.8 million.
The weighted average number of shares excludes ordinary shares held by the ESOP and the QUEST see note 25.

The bonds are convertible into Preference Shares of United Business Media Jersey Limited at any time up to the seventh calendar day before the date fixed for redemption, 19 December 2006.
The Preference Shares will, in turn, be exchangeable immediately for a total of 47.8 million Ordinary Shares in the company.
United Business Media Jersey Limited may redeem all of the $400 million bonds at their principal amount, together with accrued interest: a at any time after 19 December 2004 if the market price per Ordinary Share on each of the dealing days in any period of 30 days ending not earlier than 14 days prior to the giving of the notice of redemption has been at least 130 per cent of the Sterling Exchange Price on such dealing day: or b at any time if 85 per cent or more of the aggregate principal amount of the bonds originally issued shall have been previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted.
Convertible bondholders had a one time option to put the bond back to United Business Media Jersey Limited for par on 19 December 2004.
No options in relation to puts or calls have been exercised and subsequently all bonds remain outstanding.
In line with accounting convention, the convertible debt was classified in creditors falling due within one year 221.1 million at 31 December 2003 on the grounds that the earliest possible date for redemption was 19 December 2004.
As this date has now passed, the convertible debt has been reclassified to creditors falling due in more than one year 208.7 million at 31 December 2004.

As stated in the Financial Review, the group has redeemed $75 million of these bonds early in order to reduce the groups net interest exposure.
Additionally, to achieve a higher level of redemption without making a significant early redemption payment, the group has entered into the following transactions that have a similar economic effect to redeeming the bonds.
At 31 December 2004, the group holds $160 million 2003: $205 million of credit linked notes from a number of counterparties, these notes having similar maturities to the US dollar loan notes.
The notes pay interest at an average rate of LIBOR plus 266 basis points per annum.
In return for paying interest on the credit linked notes at rates in excess of LIBOR the final redemption to be received by the company is determined by certain circumstances related to the credit risk of the company.
These circumstances arise if there has been a credit event as defined in the terms of the note, in which case the counterparties may redeem the notes at less than par value.
A credit event arises in the event of any of the following circumstances: a bankruptcy of the company: if the group is required by any of its lenders to accelerate repayment of borrowings: if the group fails to make payment under any of its borrowings: if the group restructures any of its borrowings in order to avoid default: if any of its borrowings are repudiated, disaffirmed or rejected or subject to any moratorium.
If a credit event should take place, the credit linked note may not necessarily be redeemed for cash.
The company may receive its own bonds or debt obligations with a par value equivalent to the amount of the credit linked notes from the counterparties in settlement of redemption of the note.
Fixed rate financial assets have the following weighted average interest rates and periods for which that rate is fixed: Fixed rate financial assets Fixed rate financial assets Weighted average Weighted average interest rate period for which rate is fixed 2004 2003 2004 2003 Currency % % Years Years Sterling 4.0 4.0 0.1 0.6 US dollar 6.8 7.4 0.1 3.1 Euro The effect of the groups swaps was to classify 70 million of floating rate cash in the above tables as fixed rate however these swaps matured in January 2005.
Non-interest bearing financial assets comprise mainly other fixed asset investments for which there is no maturity.

Financial instruments continued c Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following tables provide a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and the fair values of the groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.
The fair value of US dollar private placements included in long-term borrowings was calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at risk adjusted interest rates.
Market values obtained from third parties have been used to determine the fair value of interest rate swaps, credit linked notes, forward foreign exchange contracts, the fixed rate convertible bonds and the US dollar senior loan.
The fair value of cash at bank and deposits approximates to their book value due to their short maturity.
Listed investments are valued at market value.
For all other financial assets and liabilities the carrying amount has been used.

Financial instruments continued d Hedges The groups policy is to hedge interest rate risk using fixed rate borrowings and financial instruments such as interest rate swaps.
Net foreign transaction risks are hedged as they arise, generally using forward foreign exchange contracts, whilst foreign currency borrowings are used to provide an economic hedge against investments in overseas territories.
The groups policy for accounting for hedges can be found in the Group Accounting Policies section of this report.
The tables below show the extent to which the group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
All the gains and losses on the hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses and gains on the hedged transactions or positions.

The provision in respect of these obligations at 31 December 2004 has been determined following external professional advice and will be utilised over the period of the leases in question, which range from 1 to 13 years.
Liabilities arising from former financial services activities A subsidiary of the group was formerly engaged in the selling of personal pensions prior to 1996.
As a result of the industry-wide review into pension misselling by the Personal Investment Authority, the group is exposed to actual and potential future claims by investors in respect of policies found to have been missold.
Although work continues to progress with respect to the identification and review of all pension policies sold, the number and amount of such claims can not be finally determined until all potential compensation costs have been agreed.
The amount of the provisions at 31 December 2004 has been determined on the basis of independent financial advice.
Deferred tax The amount of provided and unprovided deferred tax liabilities assets is as follows: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Provided Unprovided Provided Unprovided m m m m Group Accelerated capital allowances 3.5 4.4 Other timing differences 1.4 78.2 79.7 1.4 81.7 84.1 These deferred tax assets have not been recognised, having given consideration to the likelihood of recovery of the balance.
The above tables do not include any tax on the distribution of retained profits and reserves by overseas subsidiaries or joint ventures or associated undertakings as there is currently no intention to remit such amounts to the UK.
Additionally, deferred tax has not been included in respect of the FRS 17 pensions deficit see note 31.

On 23 April 2001, each of the existing 507,901,885 ordinary shares of 25 pence then in issue were sub-divided into one share of 8 23 44 pence B Shares and one share of 16 21 44 pence and immediately following such sub-division every issued share of 16 21 44 pence was sub-divided into 29 shares of 25 44 pence.
Every 44 shares of 25 44 pence each resulting from such sub-division were then consolidated into one ordinary share of 25 pence.
The subdivision created a class of B shares with a total value of approximately 1.25 billion.
UK shareholders had the option to sell these shares for 245 pence per share, to receive a single dividend of 245 pence per share, or to retain the B shares and receive a continuing dividend linked to LIBOR.
During the year ended 31 December 2004, 766,030 B shares were purchased by the company for consideration of 1.8 million.
Cumulatively to 31 December 2004, 369,970,901 B shares have been purchased by the company for consideration of 906.4 million.
At 31 December 2004, 5,446,789 B shares remain in issue.
The B shares are irredeemable however, the company has the authority to convert, at its option, all remaining B shares in issue after 23 April 2011, if the number is less than 125 million.
The conversion into ordinary shares will be based on the market price of ordinary shares at the time of the conversion.
B Shares B shareholders are entitled to a non-cumulative preference dividend based on the principal of 245 pence per share.
The dividend is the lower of 25 per cent per annum or 75 per cent of the 12 month LIBOR rate.
On winding up, the B shareholders are entitled to 245 pence per share and the relevant proportion of the dividends outstanding.
B shareholders do not have any voting entitlements except in a resolution relating to a winding up of the company or if the B share dividend has been outstanding for more than six months.
B shares are therefore regarded as non-equity shares.

Two of these plans were included for the first time in 2004 these are CMPMedica schemes in Australia and France.
These schemes have a combined deficit of 0.6 million.
The UK schemes are closed to new members, hence under the projected unit method, the current service cost expressed as a percentage of salary will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The group is making additional contributions to reduce the deficit in the UK.
Contributions in the UK defined benefit schemes are expected to be 16.0 million 2004: 11.8 million in 2005.
Contributions to the US defined benefit plan are expected to be 3.4 million in 2005 2004: 4.0 million.
