They have also been prepared on the assumption that approval as an investment trust will continue to be granted.
No prior year adjustments resulted from the adoption of the new SORP.
a Revenue, expenses and interest payable - Income from equity investments, including taxes deducted at source, is included in revenue by reference to the date on which the investment is quoted ex-dividend.
Foreign income is converted at the exchange rate applicable at the time of receipt.
Interest receivable on fixed interest securities, short term deposits, expenses and interest payable are treated on an accruals basis.
Where the Company has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of the cash dividend is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of the shares received over the amount of the cash dividend is recognised in capital reserves.
Expenses are charged to capital where they are incurred in connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments.
In this respect the investment management fee and relevant finance costs are allocated between revenue and capital, in line with the Boards expectation of returns from the Companys investments over the long term in the form of revenue and capital respectively.
Since April 2000, the Company has allocated 70% of management fee and debenture interest to capital and 30% to income costs.
In accordance with the SORP the Board has reviewed this policy and, having examined consensus forecasts of capital return and dividend payments, sees no need to change the existing policy at this time.
b Investments - Listed investments are valued at middle market prices.
Unlisted investments are valued at market prices ruling where an organised market in such investments exists: other unquoted investments are included at Directors valuation.
Where a price is not readily available the holding is valued at cost unless circumstances indicate a different valuation is warranted.
In general, valuations are increased where a substantial arms length transaction has occurred subsequent to acquisition, at a price higher than cost.
Valuations are decreased where subsequent transactions have taken place at a price lower than cost or where Fidelitys Fair Value Committee is aware that the Company is experiencing operating difficulties, or there is a limited market place for the shares thus making them illiquid.
c Transactions denominated in foreign currencies - Any such transactions are calculated in sterling at the rate of exchange ruling as at the date of the transactions.
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses, including exchange differences on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in capital reserves realised and unrealised.
d Realised capital reserves - Gains and losses on realisation of investments and differences on exchange are dealt with in the realised capital reserves.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.
Any associated tax relief is credited to this reserve.
e Unrealised capital reserves - Increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held are dealt with in the unrealised capital reserve.
f Taxation - Deferred taxation is provided for in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised to the extent that its recovery is considered more likely than not.
Deferred tax is recorded in accordance with FRS19 Deferred Tax.

Therefore, any capital return is not included in the above reconciliation.
c At 31 March 2004, the Company had net surplus management expenses and net surplus losses on loan relationships being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable totalling 151,680,380 2003: 131,149,793.
A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of these.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.

The annualised portfolio turnover rate for the year is 42.6% 2003: 76.4%.
Futures As at 31 March 2004 the Company had entered into contracts to sell 410 lots of FTSE 100 Index Futures June 2004.
The market value equivalent of the stock reflected in the futures contracts is 18,027,700.

This security interest and lien ranks after the senior floating charges in respect of the debentures see note 14.
11 FRS13 Financial Instruments The investment objective of the Company is detailed on page 1.
In pursuit of this objective, the Company may be exposed to various forms of risk, as described below.
The Companys financial instruments comprise: Investments held in accordance with the Companys investment objective and policies Cash, liquid resources and short-term debtors and creditors that arise from its operations Debenture stocks The risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are market price risk, which comprises interest rate risk, equity price changes and foreign currency exposure, liquidity risk and counterparty credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, which are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the accounting period.
It is, and has been throughout the year under review, the Companys policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Short-term debtors and other short-term creditors are excluded from the following analyses.
Market risk Market risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys business.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and changes in exchange rates.
At each Board meeting the Board considers the asset allocation of the portfolio and the risk associated with particular industry sectors within the parameters of the investment objective.
The Investment Manager is responsible for actively monitoring the existing portfolio selected in accordance with the overall asset allocation parameters described above and seeks to ensure that individual stocks also meet an acceptable riskreward profile.
The Company has the option to invest up to 200m of the above debenture stocks in the equity market from investing the full amount of these debentures.
In a rising market the Company would benefit, but in a falling market the impact would be severe.
In order to manage the level of gearing, the Investment Manager invests part of the assets available in short-term cash deposits.
This controls the level of net gearing.
As mentioned in the Chairmans statement on page 4 the current policy is that only 80m to 120m of the debenture stocks is invested in the equity market.
Short futures positions have been used during the year as a quick and effective means to decrease the Companys exposure to the equity market.
Due to the movement of markets in the year transactions in short term futures have resulted in realised capital losses of 3,452,000 2003: nil.
Fair value of financial assets and liabilities Financial assets and liabilities are stated in the balance sheet at values which are not materially different to their fair values, with the exception of the long term fixed rate debenture stocks, whose fair value as at 31 March 2004 has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the stocks and is set out below.
2004 2003 fair value book value fair value book value 000 000 000 000 1 11 2% debenture stock 2014 142,652 100,000 147,041 100,000 3 7 4% debenture stock 2022 121,218 100,000 119,047 100,000 263,870 200,000 266,088 200,000 Page 35 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts Interest rate risk All of the Companys long term debt is fixed rate which exposes the Company to changes in market value in the event that the debt is repaid before maturity.
The debenture stocks in issue provide secure long term funding while short term flexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities.
Information on the debenture stocks is provided in note 14.
The Companys financial assets are mainly invested in equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a maturity date.
The Company also has substantial cash balances of 6,122,000 2003: 14,808,000.
The rate of interest on the cash balances at the year end was 3.6875% 2003: 3.0625%, consequently the risk of a decrease in cash interest earned is low.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions.
The interest profile of the Companys financial liabilities excluding short-term creditors, as at 31 March 2004 and 2003 was as follows: Currency 2004 2003 fixed rate fixed rate financial liabilities financial liabilities 000 000 UK sterling 200,000 200,000 Currency 2004 2003 weighted weighted average average interest interest rate rate UK sterling 9.625% 9.625% Currency 2004 2003 fixed rate financial fixed rate financial liabilities: weighted liabilities: weighted average period for average period for which rate is fixed which rate is fixed UK sterling 172.5 months 184.5 months Foreign currency risk The Company has a small holding denominated in a currency other than the Companys base currency sterling.
The one remaining US Dollar stock with a market value equivalent to 114,000 2003: 128,000 is due to a previous strategy where overseas unquoted stocks were held.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities, which can be easily sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by the use of overdraft facilities as required.
Details of the Companys borrowing commitments are explained in note 14 to the accounts.
The maturity profile of the Companys financial liabilities at 31 March 2004 and 2003 is as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 In more than five years 200,000 200,000 200,000 200,000 The Company is invested in Fidelity Institutional Cash Fund plc - Sterling Fund the Fund.
The advantages of investing in the Fund is that the rate generated is consistent, as well as providing instant access to the invested cash.
The Fund endeavours to maintain a Triple A rating AAA and an MR1 rating by Moodys.
The Fund will be invested in low risk short-term investments and accordingly will carry a low degree of risk.
The Fund will invest in instruments Page 36 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts whose maturity or interest rate refixing date is less than one year.
It is expected that the average maturity will generally be under sixty days.
The Fund may invest in bankers acceptances, certificates of deposit fixed and variable, promissory notes master notes, commercial paper fixed and variable, floating rate notes, medium term notes, securities issued by the government primarily of an EU member state or any other OECD government including supra-national entities and securities or discount notes issued by agencies backed by such governments or supra-national entities and securities issued by non-government institutions.
The Investment Manager receives a management fee capped at 0.15% of the net asset value of the Fund.
Counterparty risk Certain transactions in securities that the Company enters into expose it to the risk that the counterparty will not deliver either the shares on a purchase or the cash on a sale after the Company has fulfilled its responsibilities.
The Company buys and sells investments on a delivery versus payment basis to manage risk.
The Company buys and sells investments only through brokers which have been approved by the Manager as an acceptable counterparty.
Additionally, limits are set as to the maximum exposure to any broker at any time, these limits being reviewed on a regular basis.

17 Net asset value per share Total shareholders funds have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 4 Capital Instruments.
The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the Articles of Association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.
A reconciliation between the two sets of figures follows:- 2004 2003 Total shareholders funds 883,641,000 681,318,000 Adjusted net assets 878,993,000 676,419,000 Number of equity shares in issue at year end 242,796,714 242,796,714 Total shareholders funds per share 363.94p 280.61p Less: Unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 1.91p 2.02p Adjusted net asset value per share 362.03p 278.59p Page 38 The Edinburgh Investment Trust plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts 2004 2003 000 000 The movements during the year of the assets attributable to the ordinary shares were as follows:- Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2003 676,419 1,196,428 Total recognised capital gain loss for the year 204,479 503,374 Revenue return for the year 29,771 27,065 Dividend appropriated in the year 31,927 32,016 Movement in unamortised debenture stock discount and issue expenses 251 251 Share buy backs - 11,935 Adjusted net assets at 31 March 2004 878,993 676,419 The net asset value adjusted to include the debenture stocks at market value rather than at par is 335.72p 2003: 251.38p.
