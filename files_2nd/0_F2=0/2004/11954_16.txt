NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1.
Accounting policies a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards using the historical cost convention.
"The group has adopted UITF Abstract 38 - ""Accounting for ESOP Trusts"" during the year."
As a result, shares in Pendragon PLC held by ESOP trusts have been reclassified from Fixed Asset Investments and are now treated as a deduction from Shareholders Equity.
This has resulted in a prior year adjustment and previously reported figures have been restated accordingly.
The effect of the prior year adjustment was to reduce the group's and company's net assets at 31 December 2003 by 10,822,000 31 December 2002: 4,667,000.
There was no profit and loss account impact.
Note 23 gives details of amounts deducted from Shareholders' Equity for shares held by ESOP trusts.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of Pendragon PLC and all of its subsidiary undertakings.
c Accounting for acquisitions and disposals The results of companies and businesses acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal using the acquisition method of accounting.
The purchase consideration is allocated to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair value at the date of acquisition.
d Turnover Turnover represents sales invoiced to third parties and income from contract hire operations when acting as agent, all exclusive of value added tax.
Consideration received from customers is only recorded as turnover when the group has performed it's obligations in respect of that consideration.
e Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of other tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Freehold buildings - 2% per annum except in the case of assets under the course of construction Leasehold properties - 2% per annum or over the period of the lease if less than 50 years Fixtures, fittings and office equipment - 10-20% per annum Plant and machinery - 10-33% per annum Motor vehicles - 20-25% per annum f Stocks i Consignment vehicles in respect of which finance charges are levied are regarded as being effectively under the control of the group and, in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 5, are included within stocks on the balance sheet as the group has the significant risks and rewards of ownership even though legal title has not yet passed.
The corresponding liability is included in creditors.
ii Motor vehicles including consignment and demonstrator vehicles and parts stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
g Repurchase commitments As part of its normal trading activities the group has contracted to repurchase, at predetermined values and dates, certain vehicles previously sold or let under operating leases or similar arrangements.
The group's residual interest in these vehicles is included in current assets and the related liability is included as repurchase commitments within creditors.
h Deferred taxation Full provision is made for deferred taxation on all timing differences which have arisen but have not reversed at the balance sheet date, except as follows: i tax payable on the future remittance of the past earnings of subsidiaries is provided only to the extent that dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute all past earnings exists: ii deferred tax is not recognised on the difference between book values and fair values of non-monetary assets arising on acquisitions unless there is a binding agreement to sell such an asset and the gain or loss expected to arise has been recognised: and iii deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on a non discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
i Foreign currencies Profit and loss accounts in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange ruling for the relevant financial period.
Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on consolidation of the net investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings are taken to reserves, as are the exchange differences on the group's long term foreign currency borrowings and commitments used to finance the group's overseas investments.
All other exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account as they arise.
j Derivative financial instruments The group holds derivative financial instruments to manage the interest risk of long term liabilities.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate derivatives are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
k Pensions The regular cost of the group's defined benefit pension schemes is expensed in order to allocate the cost of providing the pensions, recognising any actuarial surplus or deficiency where appropriate, over the working lives of the relevant employees.
The group has continued to adopt the disclosure requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17. l Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any impairment losses.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 1.
Accounting policies continued m Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 1998 was eliminated against reserves on acquisition.
In accordance with the transitional rules of Financial Reporting Standard 10 this treatment has continued to be applied to such acquisitions.
On a subsequent disposal or termination of a previously acquired business, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the amount of any related goodwill not written off through the profit and loss account, including any previously taken direct to reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised and amortised to nil by equal instalments over its estimated useful life.
n Leases Assets acquired under finance leases which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets are treated as tangible fixed assets and depreciation is provided accordingly.
The capital element of future rentals is shown as a liability and the interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital balance outstanding.
Rentals received paid under operating leases are credited charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
o Capitalisation of finance costs Gross finance costs directly attributable to the construction of tangible fixed assets are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
p Share incentive schemes Where share options are granted with an exercise price of less than the market price at the date of grant the difference is charged to the profit and loss account over the period to the exercisable date of the options.
Due regard is made to the likelihood of the stipulated performance criteria being attained with the charge being amended accordingly.
No cost is recognised in respect of SAYE schemes that are offered on similar terms to all or substantially all employees.
These are in respect of integration costs arising from the acquisition of CD Bramall PLC which include redundancy payments made to the former directors.
Tax relief on operating exceptional items of 1,395,000 2003 : nil has been obtained.
Profit on disposal of fixed assets which consists principally of profits on sale of property was 18,512,000 2003 : 3,010,000.

Taxation continued Factors affecting the tax charge for the period: The tax assessed is different than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30% The differences are explained below: 2004 2003 000 000 Profit on ordinary activities before tax 65,042 44,348 Tax on profit at UK rate of 30% 2003 : 30% 19,513 13,304 Permanent differences: Accounting depreciation for which no tax relief is due 862 475 Goodwill amortisation for which no tax relief is due 2,716 490 Difference between accounts profits and taxable profits on fixed asset disposals 1,247 510 Other disallowables 237 416 Unrecognised losses 870 834 Investment income on which no tax liability arises - 312 Tax rate differential on overseas income 388 264 Tax relief on employee share option gains 778 1,360 Utilisation of trading losses brought forward 75 - Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 1,020 1,236 Total permanent differences 1,953 1,533 Deferred tax movements taken to the profit and loss account: Accelerated capital allowances 796 367 Other provisions 370 1,353 Timing differences 426 986 Total current tax 21,040 15,823 Factors affecting the future tax charge The group operates in countries where the tax rates are different to that of the UK rate.
Germany has a lower tax rate than the UK whilst the US tax rate is higher compared to the UK.
As is common in the motor retail industry, the group also incurs a significant level of expenses which are not tax deductible mainly depreciation on showrooms and other non deductible capital expenditure.
As a result, it is expected that the effective rate of tax on the groups trading profits will continue to be higher than the standard rate of corporation tax.
The adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards on the 1 January 2005 will have implications for the future effective tax rate of the group.
There are unutilised tax losses within the group of 9,624,000 2003 : 6,725,000 for which no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
These losses are all in respect of the businesses trading in Germany.

This is the fourth year of the intervening implementation period.
Scheme valuations have been updated by a qualified independent actuary on an FRS17 basis as at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: Financial assumptions 2004 2003 2002 Inflation 2.80% 2.70% 2.30% Rate of increase in salaries 4.10% 4.00% 4.00% Rate of increase of post 6 April 1997 pensions in payment 2.80% 2.70% 2.30% Rate of increase for deferred pensioners subject to statutory revaluation 2.80% 2.70% 2.30% Discount rate 5.50% 5.60% 5.80% The expected long term rates of return on the main asset classes at were: 2004 2003 2002 Equities 8.50% 8.60% 8.60% Bonds 5.00% -- Cash 4.50% 3.75% 4.00% The weighted average expected long term rates of return were: 2004 2003 2002 7.83% 8.45% 8.36% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes assets which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were: NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 28.
