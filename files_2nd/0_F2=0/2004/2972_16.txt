Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Notes to the accounts 1 Principal accounting policies 38 a Accounting convention The Accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The transitional disclosures associated with the adoption of FRS 17 have been applied.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently, except where noted below, in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the accounts of the Company and its UK subsidiary undertakings made up to 1 May 2004 and those of its Benelux subsidiary undertakings made up to 30 April 2004.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted for acquisitions made during the period.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the period are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Intra group transactions are fully eliminated on consolidation.
Under section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.
c Turnover Turnover represents the value of goods and services sold to customers, excluding value added tax, recognised at the point the Group has substantially fulfilled its obligations to the customer.
This represents a change in accounting policy following the introduction of Financial Reporting Standard 5 Application Note G Revenue Recognition during the year and the prior period figures have been restated, as set out more fully in Note 19. d Intangible fixed assets Purchased brand names and other intangible fixed assets are capitalised at cost.
Purchased goodwill and goodwill arising on consolidation are capitalised based on the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired.
The goodwill arising on the 2003 Benelux acquisition is accounted for in Euros.
Amortisation is provided to write off the cost of all positive intangible fixed assets in equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives not exceeding 20 years.
Amortisation is charged to the profit and loss account from the beginning of the month following acquisition.
e Tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of fixed assets in equal monthly instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: Freehold and long leasehold buildings 2% p. a.
Short leasehold buildings Length of lease Fixtures and fittings 10% to 15% p. a.
Plant and machinery 10% to 15% p. a.
Motor vehicles 25% p. a. Freehold land is not depreciated.
f Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
g Deferred taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet, without discounting, in respect of all timing differences which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19. h Leased assets Assets financed by leasing agreements that give rights approximating to ownership are treated as finance leases and included in tangible fixed assets and depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the period of the lease.
Rentals are apportioned between reductions in the capital obligations included in creditors and those amounts relating to finance charges, which are charged to the profit and loss account at a constant periodic rate of charge.
All operating lease rentals are written off to the profit and loss account in equal monthly instalments over the term of the lease.
Income under operating leases is credited to the profit and loss account when receivable.
i Pensions The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
The cost of providing pension benefits is spread over the expected working lives of pension scheme members.
The Company and certain subsidiaries also operate defined contribution schemes, contributions to which are charged against profits as they become payable.
j Employee share schemes The cost of administration of the All Employee Share Ownership Plan is borne by the Company.
k Accounting for new stores Benefits received as incentives to sign leases, in the form of reverse premiums and post-opening rent free periods, are spread on a straight line basis over the period to the first rent review.
Pre-opening costs are expensed to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Carpetright plc Annual report and accounts 2004 l Foreign currency 39 The profit and loss account and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rate of exchange during the period and the balance sheet at the rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets and exchange differences between the results translated at an average rate and a closing rate are dealt with through reserves.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in foreign enterprises are taken to reserves and disclosed in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and losses.
m Cash and liquid resources Cash for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.

19 Prior year adjustment Application Note G of Financial Reporting Standard 5 Revenue Recognition has been adopted for the first time in these financial statements.
The new standard requires turnover to be recognised when a business has substantially fulfilled its obligations to the customer.
This has the impact of deferring some of the turnover and related costs until these obligations have been fulfilled.
The current period figures have been adjusted for this change in accounting policy, together with a prior year adjustment to the previously reported figures.
If the previous policy of recognising turnover and related costs had been in place at the year end the impact would have been as follows: 2004 2003 Turnover 53 333 Profit before tax 107 613 Taxation 19 184 Adjustment to profit for the financial period 88 429 The cumulative impact on the balance sheet at 3 May 2003 was 2.4 million decrease in reserves.
In respect of the balance sheet at 27 April 2002 the impact was a decrease in reserves of 1.9 million represented by 0.5 million debtors, 2.0 million creditors, 0.2 million stock and 0.8 million tax creditor.

23 Pensions costs a Defined benefit scheme The UK Company operates a pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company, being invested in a Managed Fund operated by the Clerical Medical Investment Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The most recent actuarial review was at 6 April 2002 when the market value of the fund was 4,270,384 excluding the value of any Additional Voluntary Contributions and at which date the actuarial value of the assets represented 88% of the benefits accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect on the results of the valuation were a rate of investment return of 6.5% and salary increases of 4% p. a.
Since the date of the formal valuation there have been regular updates of the schemes funding position.
Changes in market conditions have led to a deterioration in the funding position of the scheme.
Consequently, on 1 April 2003 the Company increased contributions into the pension fund to 18% of earnings, from 16% the previous year.
The employee contributions remained unchanged at 5% of earnings.
The pension charge to the profit and loss account for the current year was 490,664 2003: 458,199.
Contributions totalling 55,458 2003: 62,750 are included in creditors and have been paid to the fund since the year end.
