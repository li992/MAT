Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting basis Basis of preparation of accounts The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include properties at market value and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and the Companies Act 1985 except as stated under Tangible Fixed Assets outlined below in Principal accounting policies 2h.
With the exception of the Company Balance Sheet which is prepared in accordance with Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985 the accounts are drawn up in accordance with the special provisions of Part VII of the Companies Act 1985 relating to banking groups and applicable accounting standards have been consistently applied.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with the Statements of Recommended Practice SORPs issued by the British Bankers Association and with the SORP issued by the Finance and Leasing Association FLA. Certain comparatives have been reclassified in order to be consistent with the classification in the current year.
2 Principal accounting policies a Consolidated accounts The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the Company and all subsidiary undertakings.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been used.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
b Interest receivable and payable Interest receivable and interest payable includes all income arising out of banking activities, namely lending and deposit taking, and interest on related hedging transactions, which are all recognised on an accruals basis.
c Fees and commissions Commissions are recognised on deal date.
Fees are recognised as the right to consideration accrues through performance of services to clients.
In the event that a fee was received in lieu of interest it would be recognised over the life of the service provided.
d Dealing income Dealing income includes coupons or dividends and net profits or losses from principal securities trading and market making reported on a mark to market basis after deduction of related funding costs, agency, brokerage and other clearing charges.
e Provision for bad and doubtful debts General provisions are made in relation to losses which, although not specifically identified, are likely to exist in the banking portfolio at the balance sheet date.
Specific provisions against bad and doubtful debts are made on the basis of regular reviews of exposures and are designed to reduce the carrying value of the advance to its expected net realisable value.
For smaller balance exposures, as in our asset finance businesses, a formulae driven approach is adopted, taking into account factors such as the length of time that the payments from customers are overdue and the level of past and expected losses in order to derive an appropriate provision.
Provisions are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Interest and fees of doubtful collectability are excluded from the profit and loss account and credited to a suspense account.
Recovery expenses are written off as incurred unless there is a reasonable chance of their recovery.
f Debt securities and equity shares Debt securities and equity shares are held for both trading and investment purposes.
Listed equity shares held for investment purposes are stated at cost less any provision for permanent diminution in value.
Unlisted equity shares held for investment purposes are stated at the lower of cost and Directors valuation.
Investment securities are intended for use on a continuing basis by the Group and have been identified as such.
The cost of debt securities held for investment purposes is adjusted for the amortisation of premiums or discounts over the period to maturity.
The amortisation of premiums or discounts is included in interest income in the profit and loss account.
Debt and equity positions resulting from securities dealing have been valued at market value and profits and losses arising from this valuation are taken to the profit and loss account.
Notes to the Accounts Report and Accounts 2004 Singer & Friedlander Group PLC 47 2 Principal accounting policies continued g Net investment in finance leases, instalment credit agreements and operating leases The net investment in finance leases being leases that transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee and instalment credit agreements represents the future lease rentals receivable less profit and costs allocated to future periods.
An element of lease income is recognised at the commencement of a lease instalment credit agreement where this income can be matched against identifiable initial direct costs, otherwise income is recognised throughout the life of the deal to provide a constant rate of return on the net cash investment in each lease.
This income recognition policy has been selected due to it matching the total gross earnings to each accounting period during the lease credit term so that the earnings are matched with the associated expense.
Assets held for leasing under an operating lease are recorded as fixed assets.
Operating lease rentals receivable are recognised on an accruals basis over the period of the lease.
Operating lease assets are depreciated over their useful life on an actuarial basis to their anticipated residual value with a view to ensuring that the overall margin provides a constant periodic return on the net cash investment.
h Tangible fixed assets Furniture, fixtures and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis to estimated residual value typically over a period of four years.
Depreciation is charged on Group occupied buildings at 1% per annum on a straight line basis.
Investment properties are included in the balance sheet at open market value with the aggregate surplus or deficit being transferred to revaluation reserve.
No depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of other freehold properties and other investment properties with over 20 years to run.
Properties which are deemed to have an asset life of more than 50 years are subject to annual impairment reviews.
This treatment, as regards the Groups investment properties, departs from the requirements of the Companies Act concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the Directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Short leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease on a straight line basis.
i Rates of exchange Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies and the balance sheets of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are expressed in sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas interests are translated at average rates of exchange for the year.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation of opening net assets of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings and from the restatement of their results from average to year-end rates are taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are included in operating profit.
j Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year, amended for permanent differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is fully provided on timing differences using tax rates which are expected to apply on crystallisation of the timing differences.
No provision for deferred tax is made for the difference between the UK rate and the lower rates applicable on profits earned by subsidiaries in certain overseas jurisdictions until such profits are committed to being remitted to the UK.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent they are more likely than not to be recovered.
The Group does not discount deferred tax balances.
k Goodwill Purchased goodwill both positive and negative arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 January 1998, when FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 January 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised to nil by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 January 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Negative goodwill is recognised in the profit and loss account in the periods expected to be benefited by the assets acquired.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiary undertakings and associates are stated at cost less any permanent diminution in value.
l Pension costs In respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes the full service cost plus or less the impact of any curtailments and other past service adjustments is charged to the profit and loss account.
A charge equal to the expected increase in the present value of the 48 Singer & Friedlander Group PLC Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts scheme liabilities as a result of scheme liabilities being one period closer to settlement and a credit reflecting the long-term expected return on assets based on the market value of the scheme assets at the beginning of the period is included in the profit and loss account within the category other finance income.
The balance sheet records, as an asset or liability as appropriate, the difference between the market value of the scheme assets and the present value of the accrued scheme liabilities, net of deferred tax.
The difference between the expected return on assets cost of liabilities and that actually achieved in the period is recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Actuarial gains losses which arise from differences between actuarial assumptions underlying the scheme and actual experience during the period and the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions are also recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In respect of the Groups defined contribution pension schemes the pension costs charged to the profit and loss account are the contributions paid during the period.
m Leasing Assets acquired under a finance lease being a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee are recorded in the balance sheet as tangible fixed assets with corresponding obligations to pay future rentals.
The assets are valued at the present value of the minimum lease payments at the rate implicit in the lease.
Rentals payable are apportioned between a finance charge and a reduction of the outstanding obligation for future amounts payable.
The total finance charge is allocated to accounting periods during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the outstanding obligation throughout the lease.
Payments under all other leases, known as operating leases, are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the period of the lease.
n Derivative transactions Derivatives which are held for the purposes of hedging as part of the Groups overall risk management are accounted for in the same manner as the underlying assets, liabilities or net positions to which they relate.
In the event that these non-trading derivatives cease to qualify as a hedge they are then treated as trading derivatives and are marked to market with any gains losses being taken to dealing profit.
Derivative instruments traded on the Groups own account are valued at market prices and the resultant profits and losses are included in dealing profits.
All other derivative transactions are entered into on behalf of customers and the resultant profits are also included in dealing profits.
o Property dealing activities Dealing properties and investments in jointly developed properties, all of which are held for realisation, are included at the lower of cost and the Directors estimate of realisable value.
All costs incurred on properties in the course of development are capitalised.
The costs include purchase price, materials, labour and an appropriate amount of overheads.
Loans relating to jointly developed properties are included in property when the legal charge over the property gives the Company access to the risks and rewards associated with the legal ownership of the property.
Due to the nature of the property dealing agreements with third parties regarding the development of certain properties, the Groups share of profits on such properties cannot be determined until they are sold.
Except where the outcome of the jointly developed properties can reasonably be foreseen, rental income is not recognised until the sale of the respective property.
3 Dealing profits The net gain from trading in financial and non-financial assets and liabilities for the year to 31 December 2004 can be analysed as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 Securities dealing 1,095 1,952 Foreign exchange 1,343 1,451 Trading in non-financial assets properties 348 1,070 Funding costs 33 596 536 The main products used to generate the financial assets financial liability dealing profits include equity shares, preference shares and debt securities within Securities dealing and spot and forward foreign currency contracts and foreign exchange options within Foreign exchange.

8 Emoluments of directors The emoluments paid to those persons who served as directors of the Company during the year, excluding pension contributions, amounted to 2,131,286 2003: 1,502,584.
The Report on Directors Remuneration on pages 29 to 32 provides further information on the emoluments paid to the directors of the Company.
On 1 November 2004, the 1999 Sharesave Scheme matured and on 3 November 2004 Mr Hodson exercised his option to acquire the shares.
The aggregate gain on the exercise of options would have been 4,248 2003: 4,198 if he had sold his shares arising from the maturity on 3 November 2004.
9 Pension costs and other post retirement benefits The principal pension scheme operated by the Group is the Singer & Friedlander Limited Pension & Assurance Scheme S&F PAS which is a funded defined benefit scheme.
There is also a defined benefit scheme operated for certain of the Groups employees in the Isle of Man, the Singer & Friedlander Isle of Man Limited Retirement Benefit Scheme S&F IOM RBS.
During the year the Group acquired the whole of the ordinary share capital of Wintrust Group plc.
Wintrust Group plc operates a defined benefit scheme for certain of the Groups employees, the Wintrust plc Staff Benefit Plan 1986 WSBP.
In addition to the three defined benefit schemes certain of the Groups subsidiaries operate defined contribution schemes.
Defined benefit pension schemes S&F PAS Contributions to the S&F PAS are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary on the basis of valuations using the attained age method.
The most recent valuation was at 31 December 2003.
This valuation has been updated by the actuary as at 31 December 2004 to take account of the requirements of FRS 17.
The current contribution rate agreed with the actuary is 19% of pensionable salaries 14% employer, 5% employee.
The S&F PAS is unlikely to receive any new members and as such, under the projected unit method, the current service cost will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
S&F lOM RBS Contributions to the S&F IOM RBS are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent valuation was as at 31 December 2001 which showed the market value of the schemes assets to be 2,350,739, being 67% of the value of the accrued benefits after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
As a result of the latest valuation the contribution rate has remained at 29.9% 24.9% employer, 5% employee.
WSBP Contributions to the WSBP are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
The most recent such valuation was at 1 April 2003, when the market value of the assets of the scheme was 1,192,000 representing 102.7% of the benefits accrued to the ten members.
The current contribution rate agreed with the actuary is 62,000 p. a. payable by the employer.
There are no contributions by the members.
The financial assumptions used to calculate liabilities for these defined benefit schemes under FRS 17 are set out below.
Where the assumptions used within the S&F PAS, S&F IOM RBS and WSBP differ, the range of assumptions used has been provided.
The assumptions used by the relevant actuary in respect of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

AW had negligible net assets, therefore the cash consideration of 14.5m together with deferred consideration of 4.9m, represented goodwill on acquisition.
In August 2004, a subsidiary of the Company acquired the ordinary share capital of Wintrust Group plc for a gross cash consideration of 54.5m.
This was subsequently reduced by a dividend of 13m paid from pre-acquisition reserves.
The consideration paid exceeded the net assets of Wintrust Group plc by 11.1m and represented goodwill on acquisition.
Further information regarding the consideration paid and resulting goodwill is provided in note 22.

All of the above subsidiary undertakings are included in the consolidated accounts.
A full list of the Companys subsidiaries will be included in the Companys annual return to Companies House.
During the year the trade and assets of Singer & Friedlander Total Asset Management Limited TAM were transferred to another of the Companys subsidiary undertakings Singer & Friedlander Investment Management Holdings Limited SFIM at their book value which was less than their fair value.
The cost of the Companys investment in TAM reflected the underlying fair value of its net assets and goodwill at the time of acquisition.
As a result of this transfer, the value of the Companys investment in TAM fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Companys accounting records.
Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 requires that the investment be Notes to the Accounts Report and Accounts 2004 Singer & Friedlander Group PLC 59 22 Investments in Group undertakings continued written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Companys profit and loss account.
However, the directors consider that, as there has been no overall loss to the Company, it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Companys profit and loss account for the year and it should instead be reallocated to its cost of investment in SFIM.
The effect of this departure is to increase the holding companys profit by 12,650,000 and to increase by the same amount the value of the Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings in the holding companys balance sheet.
The Group Accounts are not affected by this transfer.
Additional subsidiaries were acquired by the Group during the year, being Wintrust plc on 2 August 2004 and Benfield Premium Finance Limited on 9 November 2004.
On 1 April 2004 the Group acquired the business of Atlantic Wealth Management Limited and Atlantic Wealth Management International Limited.

At 31 December 2004, 36% of the Groups acceptances were in respect of counterparties operating in the real estate sector and 39% were in respect of counterparties operating in the manufacturing sector 2003: 37% and 35% respectively.
38 Operating lease commitments At 31 December, the Group had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases expiring: Land and Land and buildings buildings 2004 2003 000 000 Within one year 140 9 Between one and five years 197 243 In five years or more 1,818 1,653 2,155 1,905 39 Exposure to residual values on leased assets The Groups leasing business is split between the provision of finance leases including hire purchase and operating leases.
The Group has negligible residual value risk in respect of its finance lease and hire purchase business.
Residual value risk arising from the provision of operating leases is mitigated through insurance.
The uninsured element of residual value risk can be analysed as follows: Medical Medical equipment Other Total equipment Other Total Year in which residual 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 value will be recovered 000 000 000 000 000 000 Less than one year 2,371 365 2,736 551 119 670 One two years 5,366 793 6,159 1,311 206 1,517 Two five years 10,228 3,455 13,683 7,089 2,834 9,923 More than five years 4,842 4,842 5,317 274 5,591 Total exposure 22,807 4,613 27,420 14,268 3,433 17,701 68 Singer & Friedlander Group PLC Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts 40 Derivative transactions In the normal course of business, the Group enters into derivative transactions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets.
These are used for both trading and hedging purposes.
The risk associated with trading derivatives is managed by the imposition of limits in each area of operations.
Ultimate responsibility for the control of risk rests with the Directors of the Group, however, the day-to-day operational management of risk is delegated to the operating entities within the Group, who operate within their own prescribed limits.
The methodology for managing risk varies across the Group, reflecting the complexity of the relevant businesses.
Additional background to the Groups risk management methodologies is provided in note 41.

Notes to the Accounts Report and Accounts 2004 Singer & Friedlander Group PLC 69 41 Risk management The Group enters into contracts involving financial instruments during the normal course of its business.
Such contracts may be entered into in order to facilitate customer requirements, to take trading positions on the Groups own book or to hedge exposures arising either as a result of customer business or proprietary positions.
The Group primarily enters into financial instrument contracts involving deposits, loans, debt securities, contingent liabilities and derivative financial instruments including forward contracts, futures, swaps and options.
In addition, certain financial instruments such as trade debtors and trade creditors arise directly from the Groups operations.
Derivative contracts are used for both trading and non-trading purposes.
The risk management disclosures made below apply to both the trading and non-trading elements of derivative contracts.
The use by business units of financial instruments other than those which arise directly from the Groups operations must be approved in advance by senior management.
Approval will either be considered on a case by case basis or by the setting of limits within which financial instruments must be managed.
These limits are split between financial instruments held for trading purposes and financial instruments held for non-trading purposes.
The exposures which result from holding such financial instruments are managed in order that the cumulative interest rate mismatch and the maturity and currency profiles of the financial instruments are managed with reference to approved limits.
The Groups trading activities include providing financial instruments to clients, taking proprietary positions and their related hedges.
The Groups non-trading activities include traditional lending and deposit-taking, asset liability and liquidity management, investment activity and related hedges.
Risk exposures arising from financial instruments are monitored against the approved limits on at least a daily basis either by local management or by central risk management.
Further, there is at least monthly review of the aggregate exposures by central risk management.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
The exposure to and management of these risks are summarised below.
The Group also has exposure to residual value risk as set out in note 39.
The year-end figures reported in these financial statements for financial instruments are not materially different from the positions held throughout the year within the Group, and are consistent with the objectives, policies and strategies approved by the Board.
Credit risk The Group manages credit risk by setting procedures for the establishment of new renewed credit exposures as well as setting limits for credit risk, split between direct credit exposure, credit equivalent exposure and settlement exposure.
Further, limits are set for the tenor, country and currency of exposure as well as for total exposures to certain categories of business.
The credit limits are monitored by the Groups Risk department as well as by the Groups Risk Management Committee.
Interest rate risk The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is primarily managed by limiting interest rate mismatches and using derivative instruments as described above.
The limits for exposure to interest rate risk are set at subsidiary level.
The interest rate risk profile of the Group as at 31 December 2004 and 2003 is summarised below.
Part of the Groups return on financial instruments is obtained from running a controlled mis-match between the maturity or the next interest rate fixing date of assets compared to the maturity or next interest rate fixing date of liabilities.
The tables below summarise these repricing mismatches on the Groups non-trading book as at 31 December 2004 and 2003.
Items are allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest rate repricing dates and the maturity.
Liquidity risk is primarily managed by the Groups central treasury operations with reference to liquidity limits set internally by senior management and by external regulators.
The Group has reference to regular reports which summarise the current liquidity position, thus helping to ensure that the Group has sufficient liquid assets to be able to meet its future expected cash outflows.
Currency risk The subsidiaries which are controlled by the Group are predominantly based within Great Britain and the Isle of Man.
The main operating currency is therefore Sterling.
During the year the Groups consolidated results ceased to be affected by movements in the exchange rates of the Scandinavian countries operated in by Carnegie following the completion of the Groups disposal of its investment in Carnegie.

Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
As at 31 December 2004 and 2003, these exposures were as follows: 31 December 2004 000 Euro US Dollar Swiss Francs Other Total Functional currency of Group operation Sterling 101 139 446 406 814 31 December 2003 000 Euro US Dollar Swiss Francs Other Total Functional currency of Group operation Sterling 449 638 559 606 2,252 The amounts shown in the above tables take into account the effect of any currency swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage these currency exposures.

Where market values are not available values have been obtained by discounting cash flows at market rates.
Certain other financial assets liabilities have been valued at their carrying amount as this is not considered to be materially different to fair value.
Hedging disclosures The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, caps, floors and collars: and operational and transactional currency exposures using currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the gain loss on the exposure being hedged is recognised.
As at 31 December 2004 the Group had an unrecognised cumulative aggregate gain on derivative financial assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting had been used.
This aggregate gain on derivative contracts may be analysed as approximately 2,861,000 2003: 1,779,000 of gains and 2,278,000 2003: nil of losses.
In addition, carried forward at the balance sheet date pending recognition in the profit and loss account, are realised gains on settled derivative contracts of approximately 304,000 2003: 187,000 and losses of 413,000 2003: 115,000.
On the basis of the relevant yield curves at 31 December 2004, 1,406,000 2003: 1,189,000 of gains and 1,287,000 2003: 759,000 of losses are expected to be recognised in the profit and loss account for the year ending 31 December 2005 in respect of settled and outstanding derivative contracts.
Again on the basis of relevant yield curves as at 31 December 2003, gains of approximately 1,779,000 2003: 3,273,000 and losses of nil 2003: 6,151,000 have been recognised in the profit and loss account which arose in previous years but which had previously been unrecognised.
Exposure to market risk of trading book Whilst the Groups activities are such that there is the potential for exposure to equity price risk, currency risk and or interest rate risk the Group does not have significant exposure to market risk as a result of operating a trading book.
Equity price risk Note 19 of the accounts discloses information about the equity shares held by the Group at 31 December 2004 and 2003.
These levels are not materially different to the exposures run throughout the year.
As such the Group does not have a material exposure to equity price risk.
74 Singer & Friedlander Group PLC Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts Interest rate risk The Group accepts a degree of interest rate risk as long as the interest rate mis-match between the Groups assets and liabilities does not breach pre-defined limits.
The Group manages its interest rate mis-match both trading and non-trading by using mis-match tables which plot the maturities of the various assets and liabilities held by the Group and which enable the overall exposure to interest rate movements to be monitored.
Such mis-match tables are used by each of the Groups subsidiaries where material interest rate risk could arise.
However, trading exposures are only permitted in the Groups authorised Banking entities, being Singer & Friedlander Limited and Singer & Friedlander Isle of Man Limited.
The mis-match tables are monitored on an ongoing basis by local management and are reviewed on a monthly basis by the Group Risk Management Committee.
As a result of the limits established and the ongoing monitoring of the interest rate mis-match position the Groups trading book exposure to interest rate risk was not material during the year or at the year end.
Currency risk The Groups overall currency risk exposure is managed by the Groups central Treasury department.
All significant foreign exchange transactions are sourced by this department and they manage the overall currency risk within pre-defined limits which are independently monitored on a daily basis.
As a result of the limits established and the ongoing monitoring of the currency risk the Groups trading book exposure to currency risk was not material during the year or at the year end.

On 26 January 2005 Singer & Friedlander Funding plc, a special purpose company owned and guaranteed by Singer & Friedlander Limited, issued a 250 million Floating Rate Note with a final maturity of 2010.
47 Contingent liabilities In common with other companies providing savings and investment products to retail customers, matters arise from time to time as a result of customer complaints requiring remedial action to be taken.
Some of these may be referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service FOS or other agencies.
Whilst any of these could involve payments of compensation, it is usually not practicable to provide an estimate of the potential impact, if any, until the case has been resolved.
We are in discussion with FOS on one such case.
No provision has been made in the financial statements.
