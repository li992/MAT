com 99 Supplementary information for United States investors Reconciliation of net profit loss and shareholders funds under UK GAAP to US GAAP The Groups financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
Note 1 to the financial statements provides additional information on the basis of preparation of the Groups financial statements.
UK GAAP differs in certain material respects from US GAAP.
The following notes, disclosures and tables set out the key differences between US and UK GAAP.
Net profit loss and shareholders funds reconciliation The following tables summarise the significant adjustments between net profit loss and shareholders funds net assets from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.

The Group profit and loss account, note 2 and note 3 to the financial statements disclose the results of O Netherlands 2 as a discontinued operation for the three years ended 31 March 2004, 2003 and 2002 under UK GAAP.
The carrying amount of the major classes of assets and liabilities of O Netherlands under US GAAP at 31 March 2003 were tangible fixed assets of 38 million and net current 2 liabilities of 22 million.
O Netherlands incurred no tax benefit or expense in any year presented and the loss before tax is equal to the net 2 loss shown in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Differences between accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States of America The following are the main differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP which are relevant to the Groups financial statements.
a Capitalisation of interest Under UK GAAP, the Group does not capitalise interest in its financial statements.
To comply with US GAAP, the estimated amount of interest incurred whilst constructing major capital projects is included in fixed assets and depreciated over the lives of the related assets.
This includes capitalisation of interest incurred on funding the UMTS licences for the period up to the market launch of the related services.
As at 31 March 2004, under US GAAP, gross capitalised interest of 1,324 million 2003: 1,299 million was subject to depreciation over periods of five to 20 years.
b Goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, associates and joint ventures completed by the Group prior to 1 April 1998 was written off against shareholders funds.
The goodwill is reflected in the net income of the period of disposal, as part of the calculation of the gain or loss on divestment to the extent it has not already been recognised in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions completed on or after 1 April 1998 is recognised as an intangible asset in the balance sheet and is amortised over its useful life.
Under US GAAP, such goodwill has always been held as an intangible asset in the balance sheet and was previously amortised over its useful life with only the unamortised portion being included in any gain or loss on divestment.
In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The Group adopted SFAS No.
142 required the cessation of amortisation of intangible fixed assets that have an indefinite useful life, including goodwill.
Instead, such intangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment annually, or sooner should a triggering event occur.
From 1 April 2002 the Group ceased to amortise its goodwill balances and conducts annual impairment reviews of its goodwill balances.
Those intangible and tangible fixed assets that have definite useful lives continue to be amortised over their useful life, with impairment reviews being carried out when triggering events occur.
Such definite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment in accordance with SFAS No.
144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.
In considering whether a triggering event has occurred under SFAS No.
144, the Group looks for the existence of facts and circumstances, either internal or external, which indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recovered.
Certain intangible fixed assets recognised under the US GAAP purchase accounting rules are subsumed within goodwill under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, these separately identified intangible assets are valued and amortised over their useful lives.
These include customer bases and internally developed software.
In addition, under UK GAAP, contingent purchase consideration is generally included as part of the purchase cost at the date of acquisition.
Under US GAAP, this cost is not recognised until the contingency is resolved or the amount is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt.
Year ended 31 March 2004 In the year ended 31 March 2004, the Group has not identified any triggering events which would indicate that an impairment review should be undertaken in respect of definite-lived tangible and intangible fixed assets.
In accordance with SFAS No.
142, the Groups indefinite-lived assets, being goodwill, were tested for impairment at 31 March 2004.
This impairment review indicated that no impairment of goodwill was required.
The changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the segments and in total for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 are as follows: Total Mobile telecommunications Other continuing UK Germany Ireland businesses operations Netherlands Total m m m m m m m At 31 March 2002 2,820 605 1,790 5 5,220 607 5,827 Impairment charges 409 1,475 1,884 684 2,568 Foreign exchange and other movements 126 233 359 77 436 At 31 March 2003 2,411 731 548 5 3,695 3,695 Foreign exchange and other movements 24 17 5 46 46 At 31 March 2004 2,411 707 531 3,649 3,649 As at 31 March 2004, the gross carrying value of goodwill under US GAAP was 9,237 million 2003: 10,257 million.

Due to the effects of foreign exchange, any future investments or capital expenditure on intangible assets and the date on which the assets are likely to be brought into service, it is likely that the actual charge will be different.
Year ended 31 March 2003 During the second half of the year ended 31 March 2003, certain events indicated the Group should perform impairment reviews of its four principal reporting units, being its mobile telecommunications operations in the UK, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands, in accordance with SFAS No.
These events included the announcement in April 2003 of the sale of O Netherlands resulting in an accounting loss of approximately 2 1.4 billion, which provided an indication that the valuation of mobile businesses may be lower than previously estimated.
Additionally, following the Competition Commissions report on mobile termination charges, the Group announced that it was reviewing the launch dates of its 3G services and would adopt a more prudent timetable where local regulatory requirements permitted.
The revision in this timetable, together with the absence of evidence as to the mass market appeal of 3G services and the limited availability of 2G 3G compatible handsets, led management to review and revise the business plans of its mobile operations across its European footprint.
As a result of the above events and in conjunction with the Groups annual impairment review under SFAS No.
142, the carrying value of the fixed assets of O UK, O Germany and O Ireland and the goodwill that arose on their acquisition was reviewed.
In evaluating whether any 2 2 2 long-lived assets and intangibles were impaired, the undiscounted cash flows of O UK, O Germany and O Ireland were compared to their 2 2 2 carrying values.
To test the carrying value of goodwill, the fair value of each reporting unit RU, based on the present value of future cash flows, was compared to the carrying value of the RUs assets and liabilities.
Where the carrying value of the RU exceeded the fair value, the fair value of all assets and liabilities of the RU, including any unrecognised intangible assets, was estimated in order to determine the implied value of goodwill.
The value in use of each RU was calculated with reference to the net present value of its future cash flows derived from the assets, using cash flow projections for the period up to 31 March 2013.
These projections covered a ten-year period, as management believed that throughout the ten-year period, the annual growth rate of the RUs being assessed would differ from the average growth rates for the countries concerned.
For the periods beyond 1 April 2013, the projections used a long-term growth rate assumed to be at or below the nominal GDP growth rate of the country concerned.
The discount rates applied to the projections was based on the post-tax weighted average cost of capital for the Group.
The effective pre-tax discount rate for each of our territories ranged between 10.4 per cent and 12.5 per cent.
In calculating the value in use there is considerable uncertainty as to the present value of the future cash flows.
In assessing the future cash flows, assumptions have been made using the best estimates available at the time of performing the impairment review.
These estimates include those used to reflect the growth rates up to 2013, the long-term growth rates beyond 2013, the discount rate, the competitive mmo2.
com 103 landscape, the take up and charge rate of data services and the availability of functioning technological infrastructure to support the 3G roll-out.
The actual outcome is uncertain and these estimates may change over time as subsequent changes in the mobile telecommunications industry, including advances in technology, changes in the performance of our businesses as a result of competitive pressure or otherwise, or potential difficulty in the implementation of the UMTS network, may in the future shorten the estimated useful lives or result in a further write-down of these assets.
Based on the analyses, under US GAAP the Group recorded charges of 409 million and 1,475 million for the year ended 31 March 2003 to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill that arose on the acquisitions of O UK and O Ireland respectively.
Under UK GAAP the Group 2 2 recorded an impairment of 8,300 million of the intangible assets relating to O UK, O Germany and O Ireland, of which 2,401 million 2 2 2 related to the impairment of goodwill and 5,899 million related to the impairment of long-lived assets.
The difference in the impairment charges is primarily as a result of the requirement under US GAAP to first test the carrying value of long-lived assets using undiscounted cash flows and secondarily the difference in methodology for calculating the impairment of goodwill.
As a result of the announced disposal of O Netherlands, the carrying values of the net assets of O Netherlands were written down to their 2 2 net realisable amount, being the sale proceeds less direct costs of disposal.
This resulted in an impairment charge of 1,424 million being recognised in the profit and loss account for the year ended 31 March 2003 of which 684 million related to goodwill and 740 million related to long-lived assets.
The difference between the impairment charge recorded for US GAAP and UK GAAP under which a provision of 1,364 million was recognised in respect of O Netherlands is due to the different carrying values of the net assets.
2 c Employee stock compensation The Group operates a number of share plans to grant options and share awards to its Directors and employees.
Full details, including US GAAP disclosures, are given in section III.
Stock-based compensation in the supplementary information for United States investors.
Under UK GAAP, options and share awards granted over the Companys ordinary shares are accounted for using the intrinsic value method, with the difference between the fair value of the shares at grant date and the exercise price charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period.
Under US GAAP, the Group accounts for share options and share awards in accordance with the requirements of APB Opinion No.
25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and applies the disclosure provisions in SFAS No.
148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment to FASB Statement No.
25 uses the intrinsic value method although there are differences to the UK GAAP accounting treatment based on whether the options and share awards are considered fixed or variable.
25 the cost of compensation for fixed awards being awards under which both the exercise price and the number of shares is fixed is determined at the date the award becomes fixed, based on the difference between the fair value of the shares subject to the award and the exercise price.
Compensation cost determined is expensed over the vesting period.
Until the plan is fixed including performance conditions are met, it is considered a variable plan and compensation cost is measured as the difference between the market price at the period end and the exercise price based on the number of awards expected to vest.
Share options have been granted under the Sharesave Plan at a 20 per cent discount to the market price of the date of grant.
The Sharesave Plan falls outside the scope of the intrinsic value methodology under UK GAAP.
Under US GAAP, a plan is considered compensatory when the discount to market price is in excess of 15 per cent.
Compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
The Group has applied the guidance in EITF 00-23 and if the offer to enter into a new Sharesave Plan is at a lower price than previous awards then variable accounting commences for all existing higher priced awards when the offer is made.
Variable accounting continues until the awards are exercised, are forfeited, or expire unexercised.
New awards issued within six months of the plan cancellation are accounted for as variable to the extent that previous higher priced options are cancelled.
Additionally, under US GAAP, provision for employee payroll taxes on employee stock compensation is recognised on the exercise date.
Under UK GAAP, provision is made for payroll taxes on shares that are expected to be exercised and spread over the vesting period.
d Other employee compensation expense Under UK GAAP, certain amounts paid to former owners of purchased companies who are also employees are included as part of the acquisition cost of these companies.
Under US GAAP, where payment of those amounts is based on achievement of certain performance goals, they qualify as employee compensation expense and are recognised in the financial statements when the performance goals are met.
e Restructuring costs In 2004 and 2002, the Group has recognised restructuring charges related to employee termination benefits and real estate closures.
For the year ended 31 March 2004 this involved the transfer of O Online, Products O and certain other central functions to our operating 2 2 104 mmo2.
com Supplementary information for United States investors businesses in the UK, Germany and Ireland, and includes provisions relating to redundancies and the termination of property leases.
For the year ended 31 March 2002 the charges were incurred in the reduction of over 1,900 positions in the technical, retail and administrative departments of O UK and O Germany.
2 2 Under US GAAP, site closure costs can only be recognised for the period after cessation of operations at that site.
Employee termination benefits paid to employees that are required to render service beyond their minimum retention period are spread over their remaining service period.
Under UK GAAP the provision may be recognised at the time of managements commitment, communication and reasonable estimate of the associated cost.
Accordingly, adjustments have been made to eliminate the UK GAAP provisions for restructuring that do not meet US GAAP criteria.
f Treasury stock During the year ended 31 March 2004, the mmO Employee Share Trust purchased no shares of mmO plc on the open stock market 2 2 2003: 2 million shares for 1 million, 2002: 5 million shares for 5 million.
Under UK GAAP these shares have been classified as fixed asset investments and a charge of 3 million 2003: 2 million, 2002: 1 million has been recognised for stock compensation.
Under US GAAP such shares are classified as treasury stock and are included as a deduction from shareholders funds.
This treasury stock has been accounted for under the cost method.
g Derivative financial instruments Under UK GAAP certain derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting but do not qualify for hedge accounting under US GAAP.
The financial instruments, under US GAAP, are carried at market value with valuation adjustments recorded in the profit and loss account.
h Notional loans due to BT As at 31 March 2001, 16.8 billion of notional debt, including accrued interest, was allocated to the Group, representing the borrowings raised by BT to fund the Groups major mobile acquisitions, including UMTS licences.
This loan had a deemed average annual interest rate of 7.2 per cent which resulted in interest of 756 million being notionally charged to the Group under US GAAP for the period from 1 April 2001 to demerger.
The effect of this interest charge on the deferred tax has been included in the deferred tax effect of US GAAP adjustments below.
i Long-term licence creditors In the year ended 31 March 2003, O Ireland purchased a UMTS B licence.
The total licence fee was 114 million with payments phased 2 over 15 years.
Under US GAAP the asset cost has been recorded at the discounted present value of the payments and a corresponding creditor established.
Over the 15-year period an interest cost will be expensed to recognise the full 114 million due.
Under UK GAAP the asset and creditor have been recognised at their undiscounted value.
j Loss on disposal of O Netherlands 2 The carrying value of O Netherlands under US GAAP exceeded the carrying value under UK GAAP, owing to the recognition of capitalised 2 interest costs in relation to fixed assets.
Accordingly the loss on disposal under US GAAP is 6 million higher than under UK GAAP.
k Accumulative and current year adjustment on adoption of SFAS No.
143 In June 2001, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
This statement requires the Group to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation ARO in the period in which it is incurred and capitalise the amount as part of the book value of the long-lived asset.
Over time the liability is accreted to its present value, and the capitalised cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset.
The Group adopted this new pronouncement with effect from 1 April 2003.
The Group has certain legal obligations related to network infrastructure, principally mast sites, which fall within the scope of SFAS No.
These legal obligations may include obligations to restore the leased site to its original condition at the termination of the lease.
Under UK GAAP the Group follows the requirements of FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets and a provision is made for the present value of the cost of restoration of mast sites at the date of acquisition.
Under US GAAP an expected cash flow approach to the measurement of the fair value of the ARO is used, considering the costs that a third party would incur in performing the tasks that are necessary for it to retire the asset.
The different methods used in calculating the ARO under US GAAP and UK GAAP results in an additional charge of 8 million for the year ended 31 March 2004.
This comprises of a current year adjustment of 4 million and an accumulative adjustment of 4 million which represents the adjustment required for 2003 and prior periods.
The basic and diluted earnings per share before the accumulative adjustment of SFAS No.
143 was 2.1 pence for the year ended 31 March 2004.
The accumulative adjustment does not have any impact on the basic and diluted earnings per share.
com 105 The following table illustrates the effect on the Groups net profit loss had the Group applied SFAS No.
2004 2003 2002 m m m Net profit loss As reported 180 3,671 1,463 Add accumulative effect of change in accounting principle 4 Deduct SFAS No.
143 had been applied in previous periods the ARO liability at 1 April 2002 would have been 33 million and at 31 March 2003 42 million.
The closing ARO liability at 31 March 2004 is 47 million.
l Deferred tax on US GAAP adjustments As at 31 March 2004, the adjustment of 334 million 2003: 278 million reconciling shareholders funds under UK GAAP to those under US GAAP included the tax effect of US GAAP adjustments.
This comprises an adjustment to increase non-current assets by 822 million 2003: 742 million and increase long-term liabilities by 1,156 million 2003: 1,020 million.
m Pension liability Owing to the different methods of calculating pension liabilities under UK and US GAAP, the pension scheme deficit calculated under UK GAAP using FRS 17 differs from the calculation under SFAS No.
A minimum liability relating to certain pension plans has been recognised in other comprehensive income under US GAAP, whereas under UK GAAP this balance is not recognised but included as a disclosure item only.
US GAAP pension disclosure requirements under SFAS No.
123 revised 2003 are included in section V. Pensions in the supplementary information for United States investors.
n Foreign exchange The Group carries a significant portion of its net assets in Euros.
The foreign exchange adjustment reflects the retranslation of US GAAP adjustments which are Euro denominated and has been recognised in other comprehensive income under US GAAP.
o Earnings loss per share The Groups potentially dilutive share options were anti-dilutive for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 2002 and therefore, in accordance with US GAAP, are not included in the computation of weighted average shares used in computing the diluted loss per share.
In the current year dilutive shares have been included but the impact of including them in the calculation is not material and therefore the basic and diluted earnings per share is the same.
Stock-based compensation For the purposes of US GAAP reporting, the Group accounts for stock compensation in accordance with the requirements of APB Opinion No.
25 Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and applies the disclosure provisions in SFAS No.
Aggregate share compensation costs of 34 million 2003: 3 million, 2002: 2 million have been recognised under APB No.
A charge of 8 million 2003: 2 million, 2002: 2 million was recognised under UK GAAP.
Share option plans The Group operates savings-related share option plans for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries and further share option plans the mmO Share Option Plan and the mmO Legacy Option Plan for selected Group employees.
2 2 Sharesave Plan The mmO Sharesave Plan is a savings-related share option scheme available to all employees.
The scheme enables employees to acquire 2 shares in the Company through monthly savings over a three-year or five-year Save-As-You-Earn contract.
The savings are then used to purchase shares at the exercise price, which is set at the beginning of the savings contract, at a 20 per cent discount to the prevailing market price at invitation date.
Invitations to participate in the scheme are normally made annually.
Similar savings related schemes exist for Group employees based outside the UK.
mmO Share Option Plan 2 In the year ended 31 March 2004, no options were granted to employees under this plan 2003: 1,041 employees for nil consideration.
All such options have an exercise price equal to the market value at grant date.
These options were granted on terms that they normally 106 mmo2.
com Supplementary information for United States investors only become exercisable on the third anniversary of grant subject to certain performance criteria.
If these criteria are not met on the third anniversary of grant, the performance goals will be retested on the fourth and fifth anniversaries.
Options under this scheme generally have a life of ten years.
mmO Legacy Option Plan 2 Options over BT shares granted under BT executive share option plans were replaced with options over mmO shares, granted under the 2 Legacy Option Plan, for those participants now employed by mmO.
The replacement options were granted on the same terms, and are 2 exercisable between the same dates, as the options for which they were exchanged.
The exercise price of these options equals the market value as at original grant date.
Options are normally exercisable up until the tenth anniversary of the date of the original grant.
Options outstanding in relation to Group employees under the Sharesave Plan, mmO Share Option Plan and mmO Legacy Option Plan as at 2 2 31 March 2004 together with their exercise prices and vesting periods, were as follows: Options outstanding over Options exercisable over ordinary shares and ADSs ordinary shares and ADSs Weightedaverage Weighted Weightedremaining average average Number contractual exercise Number exercise outstanding life price exercisable price 1 Range of exercise prices m years m 0.44 35 2 0.44 0.46 68 8 0.46 0.48-0.49 1 9 0.48 0.54 14 3 0.54 0.64-0.69 7 8 0.67 4 0.69 0.73-0.82 6 1 0.73 0.87 35 8 0.87 3 0.87 1.02-1.93 2 7 1.27 2 1.28 168 6 0.58 9 0.83 1 Share options over American Depositary Shares ADS have exercise prices termed in US Dollars.
For purposes of disclosure, these options exercise prices have been translated into Sterling at the year end exchange rate.
As each ADS represents ten ordinary shares, the number of options and exercise prices have been adjusted by this ratio to reflect the options on a like for like basis.
Options granted, exercised and lapsed during the years ended 31 March 2004, 2003 and 2002 in respect of Group employees under these share option schemes were as follows: Options over ordinary shares Options over ADSs 1 2 Ordinary shares ADSs  Other average Other average share share exercise share exercise options options price options price 1 Range of exercise prices m m m Balance at 31 March 2001 50 3 1.37 Lapsed on demerger 50 3 1.37 Balance on demerger Granted 31 65 0.82 6 1.17 Lapsed 2 0.84 Balance at 31 March 2002 31 63 0.82 6 1.17 Granted 37 81 0.45 Lapsed 23 6 0.72 3 0.87 Balance at 31 March 2003 45 138 0.60 3 1.49 Granted 15 0.54 Lapsed 5 23 0.76 1 1.69 Exercised 4 0.70 Balance at 31 March 2004 55 111 0.57 2 0.93 1 All options granted, exercised, lapsed and outstanding for periods prior to demerger have been adjusted to reflect the exchange ratio of 4.1266 shares of mmO per share of BT.

com 107 Fair value disclosures SFAS No.
123 For disclosure purposes, the fair value of all these share options granted is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions have been used for valuing share options granted by the Group: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Annual dividends Expected volatility 23 27 55 Risk free interest rate 5 45 The expected life applied in the model anticipated the life of options extending one month later than the first exercise date.

The weighted average fair value of share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2002 was 0.16 for options exercisable one year after the date of grant and 0.22 for options exercisable two years after the date of grant.
Share plans The Group operates share award schemes for its employees.
mmO Restricted Share Plan 2 Restricted share awards have been granted to a small group of senior executives.
Most of these awards have been granted on terms that they will normally only vest on the third anniversary of grant if the participant builds up a predetermined personal shareholding in the Group, and remains in employment with the Group.
Shares required to satisfy these awards are held in trust during the restricted period.
In accordance with APB No.
25, an expense has been recognised to the extent that executives have commenced building their personal shareholding.
No shares were granted under this plan in the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003.
The weighted average fair value at grant date of the 9.4 million shares granted under this plan in the year ended 31 March 2002 was 0.80. mmO Performance Share Plan 2 Performance related share awards have been granted to 1,005 employees during the year ended 31 March 2004.
These awards are granted on terms that they will vest on the third anniversary of grant if the Company meets certain performance criteria, and the participant remains in employment with the Group.
25, an expense has been recognised to the extent that it is expected that performance criteria will be achieved.
The weighted average fair value at grant date of the 26.4 million shares granted under this plan in the year ended 31 March 2004 was 0.53.
BT Legacy Share Awards A number of key employees of mmO were participants prior to demerger in BT share plans.
The awards have been adjusted so that they 2 relate solely to mmO plc shares, and any performance measure has been translated into a measure of the Groups performance from 2 demerger to the end of the performance period.
On maturity these awards will be satisfied in existing mmO shares held by an employee 2 trust which has already been funded by BT.
In accordance with the rules of these plans the awards were converted into awards over mmO 2 plc shares on the basis of an adjustment factor of 4.1266.
Incentive Share Plan ISP and Retention Share Plan RSP Participants are awarded shares which will normally vest at the end of a three-year period provided a predetermined total shareholder return TSR target is met.
com Supplementary information for United States investors Executive Share Plan ESP Participants are awarded shares which will normally vest at the end of five years provided a predetermined TSR target is met.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Awards of shares were made to executives based on their performance in the preceding financial year and vest after three years.
Under the DBP there are no associated performance goals.
Under the Separation Agreement between the Group and BT, it has been endorsed and agreed that all share awards required under the ISP, RSP, ESP and DBP will be honoured by BT and will be satisfied by issuance of existing mmO shares held by a BT trust which has already been 2 funded by BT.
Thus, the Group is not responsible for any of the options or shares under these schemes and will bear no compensation expense in association with them.
Group cash flow statements Under UK GAAP, the Group cash flow statement is presented in accordance with FRS 1 Cash flow statements.
The statements prepared under FRS 1 present substantially the same information as that required under SFAS No.
The main presentational differences are described below.
The US GAAP cash flow statement reports changes in cash and cash equivalents, which includes short-term highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less.
Under UK GAAP the cash balance includes only cash at bank and other cash balances.
Under US reporting three categories of cash flows are reported: operating activities including tax and interest, investing activities including capital expenditure and disposals and financing activities.
Under FRS 1, there are four additional categories.
Cash flows are presented for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investments, acquisitions and disposals, dividends paid and management of liquid resources and financing.
Cash flows under FRS 1 in respect of interest received, interest paid and taxation would be included within operating activities under SFAS No.
The following statements summarise the combined cash flow statements as if they had been presented in accordance with US GAAP, and include the adjustments that reconcile cash and cash equivalents under US GAAP to cash at bank and in hand reported under UK GAAP.

Pensions Information in respect of the net periodic benefit cost and related obligation determined in accordance with SFAS No.
The measurement date used to establish the year end asset values and benefit obligations was 31 March 2004.
The previous measurement date, used to establish 2003 costs, was 31 March 2003. mmo2.
com 109 A description of the pension arrangements of the Group is given in note 29 to the financial statements.
The assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost and the year-end benefit obligation under US GAAP for the mmO Pension Plan mmO PP are shown below.
2 2 The assumptions used for the other defined benefit schemes around the Group under US GAAP are consistent with those used for the mmO PP.

2.40 2.60 2.70 2.40 The investment strategy is determined by the Trustees of the mmO PP and responsibility delegated to the relevant investment manager.
The 2 Trustees aim to invest the assets of the Plan prudently to ensure that benefits promised to members are provided.
The investment objectives include generating a return in excess of market indices.
Ranges for the proportions to be held in each asset class have been set by the Trustees.
The Plans target asset allocations at 31 March 2004 were 90 per cent equities and 10 per cent bonds and gilts.
At 31 March 2004 the Plan held assets in the following proportions: equities 88 per cent 2003: 90 per cent, bonds 10 per cent 2003: nil and other 2 per cent 2003: 10 per cent.
Risk is managed in various ways including identifying investments considered to be unsuitable and placing limits on some types of investment.
In particular, the funds are not permitted to invest directly in any mmO Group company.
The investment strategy 2 of the Groups other pension arrangements is consistent with the assets actually held.
The expected rate of return on pension plan assets is determined as managements best estimate of the long-term return of the relevant equities and bonds that constitute plan assets weighted by the actual allocation of assets among the categories at the measurement date.
Estimated contributions to defined benefit pension schemes around the Group in 2005 are 20m.
Components of net benefit expenses No comparatives for the year ended 31 March 2002 are presented as in that period most pension obligations were provided by the BT Pension Scheme BTPS.
Under UK GAAP and US GAAP multi-employer accounting was applied to the Groups participation in the BTPS.
This applied until the inception of the mmO PP on 1 July 2002 for which the Group is the principal employer.
The cost for the period from 2 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002 equals the contributions paid to the BTPS of 4 million and is in addition to the costs shown below.
For the Groups other arrangements, the difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP is not significant.
The net benefit expense for the year ended 31 March 2004 for the Groups defined benefit pension schemes in aggregate are analysed as follows: 2004 2003 m m Service cost 18 17 Interest cost on benefit obligation 18 13 Expected return on plan assets 16 15 Plan amendments 2 Net amortisation and deferral recognised losses 4 1 Net periodic benefit cost 26 16 Defined contribution cost 7 4 Net benefit expense 33 20 110 mmo2.

The accumulated benefit obligations for the pension plans at 31 March 2004 amounted to 352 million.
At 31 March 2003, the corresponding total of accumulated benefit obligations was 262 million.

Additional US GAAP disclosures a Investments Under UK GAAP, the Group accounts for joint venture and associate investments using the equity method of accounting.
The profit and loss account includes the Groups share of the operating profit or loss, interest income or expense and attributable taxation of those companies.
The balance sheet shows the Groups share of the assets and liabilities of those companies and attributed goodwill.
Under US GAAP, these investments would be accounted for using the net equity method.
The profit and loss account would include on one line an item with the Groups share of the profit before tax of 1 million 2003: 5 million, 2002: 9 million.
The balance sheet would show on one line an item with the Groups share of the net assets of those companies.
b Exceptional items Under UK GAAP exceptional costs totalling 75 million have been recognised 2003: 8,300 million, 2002: 150 million.
Under US GAAP these would not be considered exceptional items and would be classified within net operating expenses.
c Use of estimates in preparation of financial statements The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities to the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
` d Recent US GAAP accounting pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
46 FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No.
FIN 46 was subsequently revised with the release of FIN 46R in December 2003.
FIN 46R requires the Group to review the entity's in which it holds an interest to determine whether the entity has sufficient equity to conduct its activities and to ensure that its equity holders have decision-making authority and exposure to the entity's residual returns or losses.
When any of these characteristics are lacking, the party exposed to a majority of the entity's expected losses or residual returns, if any, is considered the primary beneficiary and would be required to consolidate.
Consolidation is possible under FIN 46R regardless of whether the company holds equity or carries voting rights in the entity.
Where consolidation is not required FIN 46R imposes an obligation to disclose significant interests held in variable interest entities.
com Supplementary information for United States investors FIN 46R is effective immediately for variable interests held in variable entities created after 31 January 2003.
FIN 46R is effective 1 April 2004 for entities considered special purpose entities SPEs and for all non-SPEs as of the first US GAAP balance sheet presented thereafter.
The adoption of the standard for entities created after 31 January 2003 did not have an impact on the Group's results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows.
Management is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of FIN 46R for entities created prior to 1 February 2003 will have on its results of operations and financial condition.
In November 2002, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF reached consensus on EITF No.
00-21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables.
This consensus requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria.
In addition, arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values, with certain limitations.
The Group adopted this statement on 1 October 2003 and is applying it on a prospective basis.
The initial adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the results of operations, financial position, or cash flows of the Group.
e Recent UK accounting standards The Group continues to apply the transitional disclosure arrangements set out in FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
Mandatory implementation is not required by the Group until the year ended 31 March 2006 by which time we expect to have adopted International Accounting Standards.
The transitional disclosures required are provided in note 29 to the financial statements.
The changes introduced by FRS 17 principally affect the way defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for.
At each year-end the pension scheme assets should be measured at market value while pension scheme liabilities should be measured at a present value using a specified actuarial valuation method and discounted at a corporate bond rate.
The resulting pension scheme surplus or deficit must be shown on the Groups balance sheet, and could be volatile because of the dependence on market conditions at the balance sheet date.
Amendment to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions revenue recognition takes the form of an additional application note to FRS 5, being Application Note G. This codifies the basic principles of revenue recognition and provides specific guidance in five areas.
Of particular importance to our Group is the guidance on presentation of turnover as agent or principal.
The gross basis represents the value of the billing to the customer after trade discounts, with any related costs being charged to operating expenses.
Where we act as agent in a transaction, we recognise the net revenue earned as turnover.
f International accounting standards The Council of the European Union announced in June 2002 that listed companies in Europe would be required to adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The adoption of IFRS will apply to our Group for the first time for the half year ending 30 September 2005 and the year ending 31 March 2006.
We have established a project team to manage the conversion from UK GAAP to IFRS.
We expect the adoption of IFRS by the Group for our year ending 31 March 2006 to result in significant changes in the accounting, presentation and disclosure of certain items in our financial statements.
We expect to publish details of the differences, and a reconciliation between our existing UK GAAP results and net assets and those under IFRS in due course.
Taxation The following discussion is a general summary of certain material UK tax and US federal income tax considerations under present law relevant to the ownership and disposition of our shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs.
It applies only if you are a US holder as defined below, you hold our shares or ADSs as capital assets and you use the US dollar as your functional currency.
It does not address the tax treatment of US holders subject to special rules, such as US expatriates, banks, securities dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, holders that directly, indirectly or by attribution own 10 per cent or more of our share capital or voting power, persons holding our shares or ADSs as part of a hedge, straddle, conversion or constructive sale transaction, persons who acquired their shares or ADSs pursuant to the exercise of options or similar derivative securities or otherwise as compensation and persons that are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.
This summary does not consider your particular circumstances.
It is not a substitute for tax advice.
We urge you to consult your own tax advisers about the particular tax consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances of ownership of our shares or ADSs.
As used in this discussion, US holder means a beneficial owner of our shares or ADSs that is i a US citizen or individual resident, ii a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation under US federal income tax law organised under US law, iii a trust subject to the control of a US person and the primary supervision of a US court, or iv an estate the income of which is subject to US federal income tax regardless of its source.
If a partnership holds shares or ADSs, the tax treatment of a partner generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership.
A partner in a partnership that holds shares or ADSs is urged to consult its own tax advisor regarding the specific tax consequences of owning and disposing of the shares or ADSs.
com 113 UK taxation Dividends No tax is required to be withheld at source from dividends paid on our shares or ADSs.
Dispositions Except as discussed below, you will not be liable for tax on capital gains realised on your disposal of our shares or ADSs unless you are resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom, or you carry on a trade, profession or vocation in the United Kingdom through a branch, agency or permanent establishment in the UK and our shares or ADSs are or have been used, held or acquired for the purposes of such trade or profession or vocation or such branch, agency or permanent establishment.
If you are an individual who has ceased to be resident or ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom for a period of five years and you dispose of our shares or ADSs during that period, you may be liable for tax on capital gains on your return to the United Kingdom, subject to any available exemption or relief.
UK inheritance tax Our ordinary shares will be assets situated, and our ADSs are likely to be assets situated, in the United Kingdom for the purposes of the UK inheritance tax.
Subject to the discussion of the UK-US estate tax treaty in the next paragraph, UK inheritance tax may apply if you hold our shares or ADSs, and you gift them or die even if you are neither domiciled nor deemed to be domiciled in the United Kingdom.
If you transfer our shares or ADSs at less than full market value, you may be treated as making a gift.
Special rules apply to gifts to close companies, to trustees of settlements and to gifts where the donor retains some benefit.
If you are domiciled in the United States for purposes of the current estate and gift tax convention between the United States and the United Kingdom the UK-US estate tax treaty and you are not a UK national, you will not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless our shares or ADSs are part of the business property of a UK permanent establishment or pertain to a UK fixed base of an individual used for the performance of independent personal services.
The UK-US estate tax treaty generally provides for a credit mechanism if our shares or ADSs are subject to both UK inheritance tax and to the US federal estate or gift tax.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax, or SDRT, are generally payable upon the issue and deposit of our shares with the depository or its nominee in exchange for our ADSs evidenced by ADRs.
The current rate of stamp duty and SDRT imposed on these issues and transfers is 1.5 per cent applied, in each case, to the value of the consideration for the transfer or, in some circumstances, to the value of our shares.
The stamp duty or SDRT is payable by the depository.
In accordance with the terms of the deposit agreement holders of our ADRs must reimburse the depository for the stamp duty or SDRT.
In practice, no UK stamp duty will be payable on the transfer of our ADRs if the instrument of transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and remains outside the United Kingdom.
Transfer of our ADRs will not give rise to a liability for SDRT.
A transfer of our shares by the depository to an ADR holder where there is no change in beneficial ownership will result in UK stamp duty at the rate of 5 per transfer.
Transfers of our shares to persons other than the depository or its nominee will give rise to UK stamp duty or SDRT at the time of transfer or agreement to transfer, normally at the rate of 0.5 per cent rounded up, in the case of stamp duty, to the nearest 5 of the amount payable for our shares.
The purchaser usually pays SDRT or UK stamp duty.
If our shares are later transferred to the depository, additional UK stamp duty or SDRT will normally be payable as described above.
US Federal Income Taxation If the obligations contemplated by the deposit agreement are performed in accordance with their terms, holders of our ADSs generally will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as the owners of our shares represented by those ADSs.
Dividends Dividends generally will be included in your gross income as dividend income from foreign sources on the date of receipt by the depositary in the case of our ADSs or the holder in the case of our shares.
Distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes generally will be treated first as a tax-free return of capital to the extent of the US holders adjusted tax basis in the share or ADSs, and to the extent in excess of such tax basis, will be treated as a gain from a sale or exchange of such shares or ADSs.
The dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction available to corporations.
com Supplementary information for United States investors sterling will be includible in income in a US dollar amount based on the exchange rate in effect on the date received by the depository in the case of our ADSs or the holder in the case of our shares whether or not the payment is converted into US dollars at that time.
Any gain or loss you recognise on a subsequent conversion of pounds sterling for a different amount generally will be US source ordinary income or loss.
Recent US tax law changes applicable to individuals Under 2003 US tax legislation, some US holders including individuals are eligible for reduced rates of US federal income tax currently a maximum of 15 per cent in respect of qualified dividend income received in taxable years beginning after 31 December 2002 and beginning before 1 January 2009.
For this purpose, qualified dividend income generally includes dividends paid by non-US corporations if, among other things, certain minimum holding periods are met and either i the shares or ADSs with respect to which the dividend has been paid are readily tradable on an established securities market in the United States, or ii the non-US corporation is eligible for the benefits of a comprehensive US income tax treaty which provides for the exchange of information such as the new United Kingdom United States Income Tax Convention that entered into force on 31 March 2003.
We currently believe that dividends paid with respect to our shares and ADSs should constitute qualified dividend income for US federal income tax purposes, provided the individual US holders of our shares and ADSs meet certain requirements.
Some of the eligibility requirements for non-US corporations are not entirely certain, however, and further guidance from the IRS is anticipated.
In addition, the IRS is expected to issue certification procedures in 2004 whereby a non-US corporation will be required to certify as to the eligibility of its dividends for the reduced US federal income tax rates.
Dispositions You will recognise capital gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of our shares or ADSs in an amount equal to the difference between your adjusted tax basis in the shares or ADSs and the amount realised from the sale or other disposition.
Gain or loss upon the disposition of shares or ADSs generally will be US source gain or loss, and will be treated as long-term capital gain or loss if, at the time of the disposition, the holding period for the shares or ADSs exceeds one year.
If you are an individual, any capital gains generally will be subject to US federal income tax at preferential rates if specified minimum holding periods are met.
The deductibility of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.
The surrender of ADSs in exchange for shares pursuant to the Deposit Agreement governing the ADSs will not be a taxable event for US federal income tax purposes.
Accordingly, you will not recognise any gain or loss upon such surrender.
A US holder that receives pounds sterling on the sale or other disposition of our shares will realise an amount equal to the US dollar value of the pounds sterling on the date of sale or, in the case of cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayers, the settlement date.
A US holder will have a tax basis in the pounds sterling received equal to the US dollar amount realised.
Any gain or loss realised on a subsequent conversion of the pounds sterling for a different amount generally will be US source ordinary income or loss.
Passive foreign investment company status A non-US corporation will be classified as a Passive Foreign Investment Company a PFIC for any taxable year if at least 75 per cent of its gross income consists of passive income or at least 50 per cent of the average value of its assets consists of assets that produce, or are held for the production of, passive income.
We currently believe that we did not qualify as a PFIC for the taxable year ending 31 March 2004 for US federal income tax purposes.
However, PFIC status is a factual determination that must be made at the close of each taxable year and is based on, among other things, the type of income we receive and the value of our assets and shares, all of which will likely change from time to time.
If we were to become a PFIC for any taxable year, US holders would suffer adverse tax consequences.
These consequences may include having gains realised on the disposition of shares or ADSs treated as ordinary income rather than as capital gain and being subject to punitive interest charges on certain dividends and on the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of the shares or ADSs.
Furthermore, dividends paid by us would not be qualified dividend income and would be subject to the higher rates applicable to other items of ordinary income.
US holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the potential application of the PFIC rules to our shares or ADSs.
US information reporting and backup withholding Dividend payments made to holders of shares or ADSs and proceeds from the sale, exchange or redemption of shares or ADSs may be subject to information reporting requirements and US federal backup withholding tax at a current rate of 28 per cent.
Certain exempt persons such as corporations are not subject to these information reporting requirements.
Backup withholding will not apply, however, to a holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number or certificate of foreign status and makes any other required certification or who is otherwise exempt from the backup withholding.
US persons who are required to establish their exempt status generally must furnish a completed Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification.
Non-US holders generally will not be subject to US information reporting or backup withholding.
However, such holders may be required to provide certification of non-US status in connection with payments received in the United States or through certain US-related financial intermediaries.
com 115 Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a holders US federal income tax liability, and a holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the US Internal Revenue Service and furnishing any required information.
