Interest rate swaps totalled 75m and they expire between February 2005 and June 2006.
All other interest bearing debt is subject to floating interest rates linked either to LIBOR or base rate at a range of margins.
This amounts to other debt of 56.9m 2003: Nil.

The amounts receivable within debtors after more than one year and fixed asset investments are non-interest bearing.
The amounts due in respect of development land are non-interest bearing.
