Vedanta Resources plc 51 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Basis of Preparation Vedanta Resources plc Vedanta or the Company was incorporated on 22 April 2003 and its Ordinary Shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange on 10 December 2003 the Listing having become the new parent company of the Twin Star Holdings Group, after the group reorganisation of Volcan Investments Limited Volcan, Vedanta, Vedanta Resources Holdings Limited VRHL and Twin Star Holdings Limited Twin Star.
Prior to the Listing the Twin Star Holdings Group comprised Twin Star, a company incorporated and resident in Mauritius, and its principal operating subsidiaries were Sterlite Industries India Limited Sterlite, Bharat Aluminium Company Limited BALCO, Madras Aluminium Company Limited MALCO and Hindustan Zinc Limited HZL.
The Twin Star Holdings Group was a wholly owned subsidiary of Volcan.
After the Group reconstruction on 10 December 2003, Twin Star became an intermediate holding company in the Group, with its underlying investments remaining unchanged, and its immediate parent becoming VRHL, which in turn became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Vedanta.
Subsequent to the Listing, Vedanta was 53.9% owned by Volcan.
The accountants report for the Twin Star Holdings Group as presented in the Listing Particulars was prepared on the basis that the disposal of certain assets being Sterlite Optical Technologies Limited, Sterlite Optical Technologies Inc, Allumo AG ZUG, Manjiri Finvest Pvt Ltd and Sterlite Gold Limited, together with certain amounts receivable from these entities and from Mr DP Agarwal to Twin Star International Limited had taken effect prior to 1 April 2000.
To provide information which is meaningful to the Companys shareholders, the Directors believe that it is necessary to prepare the accounts on the basis that the Group, excluding the assets sold to Twin Star International Limited, had existed throughout the two-year period beginning 1 April 2002.
The Directors believe that this information reflects the ongoing operations of the Group more clearly.
Vedanta and VRHLs combination with the Twin Star Holdings Group has been accounted for as a group reconstruction under the provisions of FRS 6 Mergers and Acquisitions and is presented as if the Company and VRHL had been the holding company and intermediate holding company, respectively, of the Twin Star Holdings Group for each year presented.
Certain balances within the profit and loss comparatives before Group operating profit for the year ended 31 March 2003 have been reclassified to ensure a consistent presentation in the Groups Financial Statements.
Where reclassifications have occurred, these are disclosed in the relevant notes.
As Vedanta was only incorporated on 22 April 2003, the Company balance sheet is presented at 31 March 2004 only and no comparatives are presented.
The consolidated financial information for the Group has been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Accounting Policies Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial information incorporates the Financial Statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries, being the companies that it controls.
This control is normally evidenced when the Group is able to govern a companys financial and operating policies so as to benefit from its activities or where the Group owns, either directly or indirectly, the majority of a companys equity voting rights.
The principal subsidiaries included in the consolidation are set out in note 40.
The abbreviations used throughout these Financial Statements, in respect of these subsidiaries, are detailed in note 40.
Acquisitions The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
Excess purchase consideration, being the difference between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an asset on the balance sheet.
To the extent that such excess purchase consideration relates to the acquisition of mining properties and leases, that amount is capitalised within tangible fixed assets as mining properties and leases.
Other excess purchase consideration relating to the acquisition of subsidiaries is capitalised as goodwill within intangible fixed assets and is amortised over its estimated useful life up to a maximum of 20 years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Vedanta Resources plc 52 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
The unamortised balance is reviewed for impairment on a regular basis.
Negative goodwill is similarly included in the balance sheet and is credited to the profit and loss account in the periods in which the acquired non-monetary assets are recovered through depreciation or disposal.
Negative goodwill in excess of the fair value of the non-monetary assets acquired is credited to the profit and loss account through amortisation over the periods expected to benefit.
Where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first postacquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to purchased goodwill, are incorporated in the financial statements for the first full financial year following the acquisition.
Investments in Associates In the consolidated Financial Statements, investments in associates, being investments over which the Group exercises significant influence and normally owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity, are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of associates profits less losses, whilst the Groups share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet, based upon the most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim financial information.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised balance of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in associates.
Other Investments Fixed asset investments, other than investments in subsidiaries and associates, are recorded at cost less provision for impairment.
Current asset investments primarily comprise bank term deposits, short term unit trusts, liquidity funds and fixed and floating rate debt securities.
These are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tangible Fixed Assets Mining Properties and Leases The costs of mining properties and leases, which include the costs of acquiring and developing mining properties and mineral rights, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets in the year in which they are incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining property is viable for commercial production, all further pre-production expenditure is capitalised until the mining property is capable of commercial production.
From that point, capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised on a unit of production basis over the total estimated remaining commercial reserves of each property or group of properties.
In circumstances where a property is abandoned, the cumulative capitalised costs relating to the property are written off in the period.
Commercial reserves are proved and probable reserves.
Changes in the commercial reserves affecting unit of production calculations are dealt with prospectively over the revised remaining reserves.
Other Tangible Fixed Assets The initial cost of property, plant and equipment comprises its purchase price, including import duties and non-refundable purchase taxes, and any directly attributable costs of bringing an asset to working condition and location for its intended use.
Expenditure incurred after the fixed assets have been put into operation, such as repairs and maintenance and overhaul costs, are normally charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the costs are incurred.
Assets in the Course of Construction Assets in the course of construction are capitalised in the capital work-in-progress account.
Upon completion, the cost of construction is transferred to the appropriate category of tangible fixed assets.
Costs associated with the commissioning of an asset are capitalised where the asset is available for use but incapable of operating at normal levels until a period of commissioning has been completed.
Interest payable on borrowings and foreign exchange gains or losses from hedging activities related to construction or development projects are capitalised until substantially all of the activities that are necessary to bring the asset into productive use have been completed.
Vedanta Resources plc 53 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Depreciation Mining properties and other assets in the course of development or construction, and freehold land, are not depreciated.
Capitalised mining properties and lease costs are amortised once commercial production commences, as described in Tangible Fixed Assets Mining Properties and Leases.
Leasehold land and buildings are depreciated over the period of the lease.
Other buildings, plant and equipment, office equipment and fixtures, and motor vehicles are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Buildings: Operations 30 years Administration 50 years Plant and equipment 10 20 years Office equipment and fixtures 3 20 years Motor vehicles 9 11 years Impairment The carrying amounts of tangible fixed assets, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable.
If there are indicators of impairment, an assessment is made to determine whether the assets carrying value exceeds its recoverable amount.
Whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, an impairment loss is charged to the profit and loss account.
For mining properties and leases, investments in associates, other investments and goodwill, the recoverable amount of an asset is determined on the basis of its value in use, being the present value of estimated future cash flows expected to arise from the continuing use of an asset and from its disposal at the end of its useful life, discounted using a market-based, risk-adjusted, discount rate.
For other tangible fixed assets, the recoverable amount of an asset is also considered on the basis of its net realisable value, where it is possible to assess the amount that could be obtained from the sale of an asset in an arms length transaction, less the cost of disposal.
Recoverable amounts are estimated for individual assets or, if this is not possible, for the relevant cash-generating unit.
Research and Exploration Expenditure Research and exploration expenditure is written off in the year in which it is incurred unless a decision is taken that a mining property becomes viable for commercial production.
Government Grants Government grants relating to tangible fixed assets are treated as deferred income and released to the profit and loss account over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
Other grants are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
Stocks Stocks and work-in-progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, less any provision for obsolescence.
Cost is determined on the following bases: raw materials including ore and concentrates and consumables are recorded at cost on a first-in, first-out FIFO basis, except for stores and spare parts which are carried at weighted average cost: coal and furnace oil used in the Aluminium Business, and metal and coke stocks are valued at weighted average cost: finished products are valued at raw material cost plus costs of conversion, comprising labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based on normal levels of activity: and by-products and scrap are valued at net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined based on estimated selling price, less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Vedanta Resources plc 54 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but have not reversed, at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the Financial Statements.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in future has been entered into by the subsidiary or associate.
Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes, the assets of which are where funded held in separately administered funds.
The pension schemes are generally funded by payments from employees and the relevant Group companies, taking account of the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
For defined benefit schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the estimated regular cost of providing the benefits accrued in the year, adjusted to reflect variations from that cost.
The regular cost is calculated so that it represents a substantially level percentage of current and future payroll.
Variations from regular cost are charged or credited to the profit and loss account as a constant percentage of payroll over the estimated average remaining working life of scheme members.
Differences between amounts charged to the profit and loss account and amounts funded are shown as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits is the contributions payable in the year.
Differences between contributions payable in the year and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Details of the pension schemes are provided in note 29.
Employee Share Awards The estimated cost of employee share awards made by the Group is charged to the profit and loss account over the relevant performance period.
Where shares are held by an employee benefit trust, the carrying value of these shares is included within other fixed asset investments, less amounts charged to the profit and loss account relating to those shares.
The estimated cost of awards is the market value of shares awarded or the intrinsic value of the awards being the difference between the exercise price of the award and the market price at the date of grant adjusted to reflect any applicable performance conditions.
Provisions for Liabilities and Charges Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation, as a result of past events, and it is probable that an outflow of resources, that can be reliably estimated, will be required to settle such an obligation.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and are adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.
Restoration, Rehabilitation and Environmental Costs An obligation to incur restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs arises when environmental disturbance is caused by the development or ongoing production of a mine.
Costs arising from the installation of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises.
These costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the operation through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the discount on the provision.
Vedanta Resources plc 55 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage which is caused on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and charged to the profit and loss account as extraction progresses.
Where the costs of site restoration are not anticipated to be material, they are expensed as incurred.
Revenue Recognition Turnover represents the net invoice value of goods and services provided to third parties after deducting sales taxes and duties, and is recognised when all significant risks and rewards of ownership of the asset sold are transferred.
Dividends are recognised when paid.
Leases Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Foreign Currency Translation In the financial statements of individual group companies, transactions in currencies other than the local functional currency are translated into local currency at the exchange rates ruling at the date of transaction or, where forward exchange contracts are in place, at contractual rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into local currency at year end exchange rates, or at a contractual rate if applicable.
For the purposes of consolidation, the results of those entities for whom the US dollar is not the reporting currency are translated into US dollars at the average rates of exchange during the period.
The related balance sheets are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and results of such operations, and on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they hedge the Groups investment in such operations, are reported in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
The exchange rates applied for the translation of the Groups financial information are set out below: As at As at US$ Currency rates 31 March 2004 Average 2003 2004 31 March 2003 Indian rupee INR 43.39 45.92 47.65 Euro 0.817 0.853 0.926 Australian dollar A$ 1.312 1.445 1.663 UK pounds sterling GBP 0.545 0.591 0.635 Capital Instruments Ordinary Shares are included in shareholders funds.
Other instruments are classified as liabilities if they contain an obligation to transfer economic benefit and, if not, they are included in shareholders funds.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The finance cost recognised in the profit and loss account in respect of capital instruments, other than equity shares, is allocated to periods over the term of the instrument at a constant rate on the carrying value.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is reported as a liability unless conversion actually occurs.
No gain or loss is recognised on conversion.
Derivative Financial Instruments In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks, the Group enters into forward, option, swap contracts and other derivative financial instruments.
The Group does not hold nor issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Group uses the derivative financial instruments described above to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price risks.
The Group considers that its derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting when the following criteria are met: the instrument is related to a foreign currency asset or liability that is probable and whose characteristics have been identified: it involves the same currency as the hedged item: and it reduces the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on operations.
Vedanta Resources plc 56 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 2.
Accounting Policies continued Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and are recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Financial Statements.
The rates applicable to such contracts are used to record the hedged item.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge, the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Where commodity option contracts hedge anticipated future production or purchases, the option premiums paid are amortised over the life of the option and any realised gains and losses on exercise, in the period in which the hedged production is sold or commodity purchases are made, are recognised.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss is recognised at that time.

Tax on Profit on Ordinary Activities continued a Analysis of Charge for the Year continued Overview of the Indian Direct Tax Regime The following is an overview of the salient features of the Indian direct tax regime relevant to the taxation of the Group: Companies are subject to Indian income tax on a stand-alone basis.
There is no concept of tax consolidation or group relief in India.
Companies are charged tax on profits of assessment years which run from 1 April to 31 March.
For each assessment year, a companys profits will be subject to either regular income tax or Minimum alternate tax MAT, whichever is the greater.
Regular income tax is charged on book profits prepared under Indian GAAP adjusted in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Income Tax Act.
Typically the required adjustments generate significant timing differences in respect of the depreciation of fixed assets, relief for provisions and accruals, the use of tax losses brought forward and pension costs.
Regular income tax is charged at 35% plus a surcharge.
MAT is charged on book profits prepared under Indian GAAP but typically with a limited number of adjustments.
MAT is charged at 7.5% plus a surcharge.
There are various tax exemptions or tax holidays available to companies in India.
The most important to the Group are: The export exemption.
For the five years to 31 March 2004, profits earned from export activities can be exempt.
In the year to 31 March 2000, the extent of the exemption was 100% reducing each year to 30% in the final year to 31 March 2004.
Profits of newly constructed industrial undertakings located in designated areas of India can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical tax holiday would exempt 100% of the plants profits for five years, and 30% for the next five years.
Profits on newly constructed power plants can benefit from a tax holiday.
A typical holiday would exempt 100% of profits in ten consecutive years within the first 15 years of the power plants operation.
The start of the ten-year period can be chosen by a company.
Tax is payable in the assessment year to which it relates.
Tax returns submitted by companies are regularly subjected to a comprehensive review and aggressive challenge by the tax authorities.
There are appeals procedures available to both the tax authorities and taxpayers and it is not uncommon for significant or complex matters in dispute to remain outstanding for several years before they are finally resolved in the High Court or the Supreme Court.

During the period the effective tax rate has been significantly less than the applicable Indian corporate rate of income tax.
This is primarily as a result of the significant tax exemptions export exemptions, industrial undertakings and tax holidays which have been available to shelter profits of Sterlite and HZL from regular income tax.
The beneficial effect of these exemptions on the Groups rate has been tempered to some extent by the impact of losses in Australia and IFL, which are not available to shelter profits from tax and disallowed expenditure.
c Factors that may Affect Future Tax Charges The effective tax rate of the Group in future periods is likely to be influenced most significantly by the following factors: the availability of exemptions and tax holidays to shelter profits from regular Indian income tax: the potential utilisation of accumulated tax losses of CMT and IFL, the potential benefit of which has not been fully recognised as a deferred tax asset: and incremental tax costs, if any, of distributing earnings to shareholders through the Group structure.

The only other issue of shares subsequent to the Listing were 388,000 Ordinary Shares issued pursuant to the exercise of the first tranche of awards under the Vedanta Resources Reward Plan the Reward Plan on 31 March 2004, and the issue of these shares has been used in determining the 2004 weighted average number of shares.
The Directors believe that this proforma EPS provides a more meaningful comparison of the Groups ongoing business than using the statutory EPS which would only reflect shares issued at the date of Listing.
The second tranche of awards under the Reward Plan and the oustanding awards under the Vedanta Resources Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP are reflected in the diluted EPS figure through an increased number of weighted average shares.

As required by the Companies Act 1985, Section 132, upon issue of 156,000,000 Ordinary Shares to Volcan, Twin Stars issued share capital and share premium account have been eliminated and a merger reserve of US$4.4 million arose, being the difference between the carrying value of the investment in Twin Star in Volcans accounts and the nominal value of the shares issued to Volcan.
As required by the Companies Act and FRS 4 Capital Instruments, the Company wrote off US$51.4 million of costs incurred as a direct result of the Companys Listing.
Being a newly incorporated company, Vedanta had no distributable reserves.
On 10 December 2003, the High Court in London sanctioned a capital reduction, under which the share premium account was reduced by US$793.7 million in order to create distributable reserves.

Consolidated Reconciliation of Movement in Equity Shareholders Funds continued As at 31 March 2004, other reserves comprise the general reserves established in the statutory accounts of the Groups Indian subsidiaries.
Under Indian law, a general reserve is created through a year on year transfer from the profit and loss account.
The amount transferred is 5% of the profits for the year for each Indian company as stated in Indian GAAP.
The purpose of these transfers is to ensure that distributions in a year are less than the total distributable results for that year.
This general reserve becomes fully distributable in future periods.

Acquisitions a Hindustan Zinc Limited On 12 November 2003 SOVL completed the acquisition of an additional 18.92% of the ordinary share capital of HZL by exercising a call option available under the original share purchase agreement.
Following this transaction, SOVLs holding in HZL increased to 64.9% giving the Group an effective holding of 42.7% at 31 March 2004.
The consideration for this transaction was US$70.5 million, and resulted in a reduction in Group minority interests of US$82.4 million see note 21. b Sterlite Employees Welfare Trust On 2 January 2004 the Group purchased 4.98% of Sterlites issued share capital from the SEWT for a cash consideration of US$58.0 million, being the open market price at that date.
However, as this acquisition is an intra-group transaction, this cash consideration eliminates on consolidation and is thus not included as an acquisition cash flow in the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement.
Following this acquisition the Groups effective holding in Sterlite increased to 65.8%.
This acquisition led to a reduction in Group minority interests of US$15.9 million see note 21.
There was no cash effect on the Group as the SEWT is consolidated as a quasi-subsidiary.
c Transaction with Sterlite Optical Technologies Limited During the year ended 31 March 2004 the Group paid deferred consideration of US$10.6 million to SOTL relating to the acquisition of 20% of SOVL from SOTL in January 2003.
Vedanta Resources plc 78 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 27.
Operating Lease Commitments The Group does not have any material operating lease commitments.
Financial Instruments The Groups accounting policies with regard to financial instruments are detailed in note 2.
The Group does not trade in financial instruments.
As permitted by FRS 13 Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosure, short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the disclosures, other than the currency disclosures.
Derivatives, Financial Instruments and Risk Management The Group uses derivative instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The use of derivatives can give rise to credit and market risk.
The Group controls credit risk by only entering into contracts with banks and institutions with the highest national or international standing.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits, authorities and regular monitoring by appropriate levels of management.
The limits, authorities and monitoring systems are periodically reviewed by management and the Board.
The market risk on derivatives is mitigated by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions, as derivatives are used only for risk management.
Foreign Exchange Risk The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps, options and other derivatives to hedge the effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The sources of foreign exchange risk are outstanding amounts payable for imported raw materials, capital goods and other supplies as well as financing transactions, loans and current asset investments denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group is also exposed to foreign exchange risk on its exports.
Most of these transactions are denominated in US dollars.
The policy of the Group is to determine on a regular basis what portion of the foreign exchange risk on financing transactions, loans and current asset investments are to be hedged through forward exchange contracts and other instruments.
There are systems in place for the period in review of open i. e. unhedged exposure limits and stop-loss levels by management.
Interest Rate Risk The short term debt of the Group is principally denominated in Indian rupees with fixed rates of interest.
While no significant interest rate risk arises on this portion of the debt the Group utilises interest rate swap products to optimise the interest liability.
On foreign currency denominated debt the Group has a policy of selectively using interest rate swap and option contracts to hedge its exposure to interest rate movements.
Most of the foreign currency debt is on floating rates of interest linked to six-month US dollar LIBOR.
These exposures are reviewed by appropriate levels of management on a monthly basis.
Counterparty and Concentration of Credit Risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of debtors, current asset investments and derivative financial instruments.
There is no concentration of credit risk among the debtors of the Group given the large number of debtors and the business diversity.
Credit risk on debtors is very limited as almost all credit sales are against letters of credit of banks of national standing.
In respect of current asset investments, counter party limits are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
For derivative and financial instruments, the credit risk is limited as the Group only deals with banks and institutions with the highest national or international standing.
These exposures are further reduced by having standard ISDA Master agreements including set-off provisions with each counterparty.
Commodity Price Risk Aluminium The raw material is mined in India with sales in the domestic market being linked to the average LME price prior to the month of despatch.
Currently no hedging is undertaken in this commodity.
Copper A large portion of the copper turnover benefits from a natural hedge created by matching quotational periods for concentrate purchases with the timing of finished metal sales.
The balance, the free metal being the difference between payable metal and the recovery and the precious metal content are hedged through forward sales or options.
Presently, approximately 13,000 tonnes of copper is considered as iron stock and no hedging is undertaken.
Depending on opportunities offered by the market, put call options are taken against free metal available.
Zinc The raw material is mined in India with sales in the domestic market being linked to the average LME price for the fortnight prior to the fortnight of despatch.

For the year ended 31 March 2004 the fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting anticipated future returns and payments at an appropriate discount rate.
c Undrawn Borrowing Facilities The Group has various borrowing facilities available to it.

The analysis of the net monetary assets and liabilities indicates the Groups exposures in various operating companies that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the Company.
These exposures represent the transactional exposures that may give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
These exposures are net of the forward contracts and derivative products used to manage currency exposures.

Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

Pensions The Group operates pension schemes for the majority of its employees in both India and Australia.
a Defined Contribution Schemes Central Provident Fund The Central Provident Fund relates to all full time Indian employees of the Group.
The amount contributed by the Group is a designated percentage of 12% of basic salary, together with an additional contribution of 12% of salary made by the employee.
The benefit is paid to the employee on their retirement or resignation from the Group.
Superannuation Superannuation, another pension scheme applicable throughout India, is applicable only to senior executives.
Each relevant company holds a policy with the Life Insurance Corporation of India LIC, to which each company contributes a fixed amount relating to superannuation, and the pension annuity is met by LIC as required, taking into consideration the number of years of service of the executive, and the contributions made.
Accordingly, this scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Pension Fund The Pension Fund was established in 1998 and is managed by the Government.
The employee makes no contribution to this fund but the employer makes a contribution of 8.33% of salary each month.
This must be provided for every permanent employee on the payroll.
At the age of 60 the statutory retirement age for all non-professional employees, contributions cease and the individual receives a monthly payment based on the level of contribution through the years and on their salary scale at the time they retire, subject to a maximum ceiling of salary level.
The Government funds these payments, and thus the Group has no additional liability beyond the contributions that it makes, regardless of whether the central fund is in surplus or deficit.
It is not possible to assess the Groups own level of assets or liabilities within the fund as it is effectively a multi-employer scheme.
On this basis it is accounted for as a defined contribution scheme.
No information regarding the overall level of surplus or deficit in the fund is publicly available.
Australian Pension Schemes The Group also operates defined contribution pension schemes in Australia.
The contribution of a proportion of an employees salary into a superannuation fund is a compulsory legal requirement in Australia.
The employer contributes at least 9% of the employees gross remuneration into the employees fund of choice and the employee has the option to make additional voluntary contributions.
b Defined Benefit Schemes The defined benefit schemes operate in India.
Gratuity Gratuity is a defined benefit scheme which is open to all Group employees in India who have a minimum of five years of service with their employing company.
This scheme is funded by the Group, either through cash contributions or provisions each year, based on actuarial valuations.
Under this scheme, benefits are provided based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate fund and a full actuarial valuation of the scheme is carried out on an annual basis.
c Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies Sterlite Sterlite holds a policy with the LIC under which the company contributes a pre-determined premium, such that the LIC will meet the payments, when required, to the individual employee concerned in accordance with an actuarial valuation.
In this situation, the exposure is limited to the amount of the contribution each year and is not affected by valuation deficits.
The insurance is pooled with other employers and it is therefore not possible to assess the Groups own level of assets or liabilities within the scheme.
Accordingly, with respect to Sterlite, the scheme has been accounted for on a defined contribution basis and contributions are charged directly to the profit and loss account.
Vedanta Resources plc 83 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 29.
Pensions continued c Pension Schemes existing within Group Companies continued MALCO MALCO does not contribute to the LIC.
MALCOs Gratuity scheme is therefore accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
The latest actuarial valuation was performed as at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit actuarial method.
At that date the fund was in deficit.
The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 8% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5%.
BALCO At BALCO, all employees who are scheduled to retire on or before 31 March 2005 are covered by the LIC and therefore their remaining contributions are accounted for on a defined contribution basis.
However, the scheme is accounted for as a defined benefit scheme for all employees scheduled to retire after 31 March 2005, who are not covered by the LIC.
The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 7.5% per annum and an annual salary increase of 5%.
HZL HZL contributes to the LIC but the policy does not cover the full deficit of the Gratuity scheme.
HZLs Gratuity scheme is therefore accounted for on a defined benefit basis.
The main assumptions used in the actuarial valuation were a discount rate of 7.5% per annum and an annual salary increase of 4.5%.
As at 31 March 2004 membership across MALCO, BALCO and HZL stood at 10,735 employees 31 March 2003: 11,943.
The deficits and other aspects of these schemes are disclosed in further detail in notes d and e below.
d SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The Group accounts for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The retirement benefit charge for the year was as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 2004 31 March 2003 US$ million US$ million Defined contribution pension schemes 4.2 5.6 Defined benefit pension schemes 3.9 5.6 8.1 11.2 There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions for either the defined contribution or the defined benefit schemes as at 31 March 2004 or 31 March 2003.
The latest full actuarial valuations of the Gratuity schemes for MALCO, BALCO and HZL as at 31 March 2004, were carried out by R. Krishnawamy, Watson Wyatt India Pvt Ltd and Charan Gupta Consultants Pvt Ltd, consulting actuaries to MALCO, BALCO and HZL, respectively.
The results of these valuations have been used as the basis for assessing pension costs for the two years ended 31 March 2004. e FRS 17 Retirement Benefits Transitional Disclosures The results for the year ended 31 March 2004 continue to include a pension charge calculated under the principles of SSAP 24.
Transitional arrangements for the adoption of FRS 17 require the disclosures set out below.
The disclosures relate to the second year of the transitional provisions.
The United Kingdom Accounting Standards Board has deferred the date for full adoption of FRS 17.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations of the MALCO, BALCO and HZL Gratuity schemes.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value as at the relevant period end date.

Contingencies The Group has the following contingencies.
With regard to the claims against Group companies included below, no provision has been made in the Financial Statements as the Directors believe that it is more likely than not that the claims will not give rise to a material liability.
MALCO Claims Under the terms of a financial aid package, MALCO was entitled to benefit from reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1995 to 1999.
In 1997 MALCO became profitable, and in 1999 the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board TNEB made a claim against MALCO for the difference in value between full price and reduced tariff electricity for the period from 1997 to 1999.
The value of this claim was US$72.1 million.
The case was heard in November 1999 and the Court found in MALCOs favour.
TNEB has appealed the decision and this appeal has not yet been heard.
TNEB is also claiming US$23.6 million from MALCO for an electricity self-generation levy.
This claim has arisen since the opening of MALCOs captive power plant in 1999.
MALCO has applied for an exemption from the levy and a decision is pending.
In February 1999, MALCO entered into an agreement with TECHMO Car SpA TECHMO to modernise the smelter pot rooms at Mettur Dam.
In February 2003, this contract was terminated by TECHMO following disputes over the project.
In March 2003, MALCO issued a claim against TECHMO to recover expenditure incurred on the project, citing non-performance by TECHMO.
The value of this claim is US$6.3 million.
The District Court had ordered TECHMO to provide the full amount of the claim to MALCO as security, which was subsequently stayed by the Madras High Court.
MALCO has since filed a petition with the Supreme Court of India.
MALCO has cashed a bank guarantee, provided by TECHMO for the project, amounting to US$0.7 million.
In June 2003, TECHMO moved for arbitration claiming a total of US$2.8 million being the unpaid portion of the contract.
Arbitration proceedings under ICC rules are ongoing.
Sterlite Disputed Tax Liability In December 1999, the Indian tax authorities carried out a search at Sterlites locations, as well as at the residential premises of its directors and senior officials.
Following this search the tax department alleged that, inter alia, Sterlite had claimed tax relief for unsupported purchases of fixed assets and required Sterlite to make a return of undisclosed income for the block assessment period from 1 April 1989 to 8 December 1999.
Sterlite made a return and paid US$3.9 million of additional tax in respect of the block assessment period.
Based on their findings, the tax authorities then issued a block assessment, claiming total tax of US$6.4 million.
Sterlite lodged an appeal against the US$2.5 million additional tax charged by the authorities, but also allocated a tax overpayment against this contested liability pending the appeal.
The appeal was decided in Sterlites favour reducing the tax claim to US$4.1 million, which is covered by the amount previously paid by Sterlite.
The appeal ruling stated that there were no unsupported purchases of fixed assets.
The tax authorities are expected to initiate a further appeal to the tax tribunal.
Sterlite intends to launch an appeal over certain aspects of the ruling in the first appeal.
The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 includes a provision of US$1.9 million against this tax overpayment receivable balance.
Excise Duty Disputes Sterlite, HZL and BALCO The Indian excise authorities have made claims against Sterlite for additional excise duties on the grounds that they dispute the assessable value of finished goods applied by Sterlite in its returns.
The amount of the duties in dispute is US$9.3 million.
At 31 March 2004, the balance sheet includes a provision of US$6.6 million in respect of this claim.
The authorities are also claiming additional duties of US$3.1 million from BALCO, the majority of which relates to materials used for the construction of BALCOs cold rolling mill.
The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 includes a provision of US$0.5 million in respect of outstanding duties.
Vedanta Resources plc 90 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 32.
Contingencies continued In addition, HZL has received demands for US$8.7 million in relation to excise duties.
There is a related provision of US$4.5 million in the balance sheet at 31 March 2004.
All claims are being vigorously contested by management.
Central Bank of India Claim BALCO The Central Bank of India is claiming US$2.2 million from BALCO in relation to its Bidhanbagh unit.
This claim relates to loan facilities provided between 1974 and 1978 to Aluminium Corporation of India Limited now part of BALCO.
The BALCO management continues to contest the claim.
HZL Sales Tax Declaration Forms In order to benefit from a refund rate of sales tax 4% instead of 12% on zinc product sales, certain States require the completion of specific documentation.
At 31 March 2004, documentation relating to claims for benefits of US$4.0 million had not been submitted.
The balance sheet at 31 March 2004 includes a provision of US$1.4 million against benefits which would be lost if appropriate documents cannot be filed.
HZL Sales Tax Demands HZL has received demands for US$1.9 million of additional sales taxes relating primarily to the transfer of goods to sales offices.
HZL is appealing against the demand and expects to pay US$0.2 million of additional tax.
A provision for this amount is included in the balance sheet at 31 March 2004.
Chanderiya Lead and Zinc Smelter Claim HZL Prior to privatisation, HZL purchased land adjacent to the Chanderiya site in order to facilitate the expansion of operations.
The land was purchased by the Government at the open market price.
Subsequently the previous owner has issued a claim against HZL stating that the consideration was below the fair value.
There is no reliable estimate of the potential liability.
The HZL management believe that the claim is unlikely to succeed.
Share transactions Call and Put Options HZL With effect from 11 April 2007, SOVL has the right to purchase all of the Governments remaining shares in HZL at fair market value.
If the Governments holding in HZL is greater than 26% at 11 October 2004, it has the right to exercise a put option requiring SOVL to buy sufficient shares to reduce the Governments holding to 26%.
The exercise price will be the higher of the open market price and INR 40.50 per share.
The option is open for the six months from 11 October 2004 to 10 April 2005.
As at 31 March 2004, the Governments holding in HZL was 35.1%.
Call Option BALCO Sterlite purchased a 51% holding in BALCO from the Government on 2 March 2001.
Under the terms of this purchase agreement for BALCO, Sterlite has a call option that allows it to purchase any remaining Government holding in BALCO at any point from 2 March 2004.
The purchase price per share under this option would be the higher of fair market value and INR 49.01 plus 14% interest per annum.
HZL Share Allotment from Open Offer SOVL purchased its initial holding in HZL in two stages, 26% in April 2002 and a further 20% under an open offer in June 2002.
Under Securities Exchange Board of India rules, where an open offer is used, a SEBI approved bank must be responsible for the allotment of shares to ensure that the smaller shareholders are protected.
It has been deemed by SEBI that the allotment by SOVL and SBI Capital SOVLs bankers was not equitable in nature and SEBI are to rule on the issue.
RBI Approval Relating to Non-resident Indians SOVL Under Indian law, non-resident Indians NRIs must apply to SEBI to sell any shares.
During the acquisition of HZL in 2002, SOVL entered a combined application for NRIs.
The approval of nine shareholders applications was delayed resulting in payments not being made within the 30 day limit.
SEBI is claiming interest totalling US$0.1 million as a result of the delay but management believe this will fail as the delay was not attributable to SOVL, since the application was made on behalf of others and no financial gain was made, as the monies were held in escrow.
The matter is awaiting hearing by the Securities Appellate Tribunal.
As at 31 March 2004, and at the date of this report, 9,512,801 shares being 2.2% of HZLs issued share capital out of the 274,315,331 shares held in HZL by SOVL, are held in an escrow account pending completion of formalities with SEBI.
Vedanta Resources plc 91 Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 33.
Share Transactions continued Convertible Debt IFL IFL has a loan of US$22.6 million with ICICI Bank.
ICICI has an option to convert this debt to equity shares at par value at any time up to maturity of the loan in 2012.
If this option is exercised, MALCOs holding in IFL will reduce from 38.8% to 8.7%.
Subsequent Events Purchase of 2.4% of Sterlite from the SEWT On 2 April 2004, the Group purchased an additional 2.4% being 1,695,794 shares of Sterlites issued share capital from the SEWT at an open market price of US$21.4 million.
This acquisition increased the Groups effective holding in Sterlite to 68.1%.
Sterlite rights issue In December 2003, Sterlite initiated a rights issue, which was fully underwritten by the Group.
In June 2004, Sterlite obtained SEBI approval for a three-for-ten rights issue which has been altered to a one-for-two, and re-submitted for approval.
Completion of the issue is expected in the second half of 2004, with expected proceeds of US$440 million, net of all costs.
BALCO dispute with National Thermal Power Corporation NTPC Subsequent to 31 March 2004, BALCO has been in dispute with NTPC over the rates at which water and coal are being supplied to the BALCO captive power plant which BALCO took over from NTPC.
One of the key points in the dispute is the assertion of non co-operation by NTPC, which has prevented BALCO from setting up its own coal handling and water pipeline facilities.
The matter was taken to arbitration, where BALCO was successful.
However, NTPC appealed to the High Court in Delhi, where NTPC gained an interim order raising the coal and water pipeline charges by around ten times the original level.
BALCO is appealing this ruling and the hearing is expected in July 2004.
