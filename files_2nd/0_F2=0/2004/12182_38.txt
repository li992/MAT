Floating rates are based on LIBOR and EURIBOR.
The non-equity minority shares of 24 million 2003 25 million relate principally to Pilkington Deutschland AG and Dahlbusch AG with rights to a dividend of 3.65 per cent and 3.09 per cent respectively.
These rates remain fixed in perpetuity and, in consequence, the average periods for which the rates are fixed are excluded from the figures noted in the above table.
The maturity profile of the Groups interest bearing financial liabilities is as follows: 2004 2003 Group Group m m Loans and overdrafts Due for repayment within one year or on demand 94 137 Due for repayment between one and two years 15 202 Due for repayment between two and five years 75 87 Due for repayment in more than five years 525 481 709 907 Finance leases Due for repayment within one year or on demand 9 8 Due for repayment between one and two years 21 10 Due for repayment between two and five years 1 10 Due for repayment in more than five years 16 1 47 29 Total interest bearing financial liabilities 756 936 Pilkington plc Directors report and accounts 2004 37 Notes on the financial statements continued 25 ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AND ASSETS CONTINUED The maturity profile of the Groups non-interest bearing financial liabilities is as follows: 2004 2003 Group Group m m Creditors and contractual provisions Due for repayment within one year or on demand 4 4 Due for repayment between one and two years 5 4 Due for repayment between two and five years 16 10 Due for repayment in more than five years 16 17 Total non-interest bearing financial liabilities 41 35 The analysis of non-interest bearing liabilities by currency and the weighted average period until maturity has not been disclosed on the grounds of materiality.
2004 2003 Group Group m m b Financial assets The Group held the following financial assets as part of its financing arrangements: Cash and bank balances 40 42 Marketable investments including term deposits of 37 million 2003 13 million 52 33 Debtors amounts falling due after more than one year non-interest bearing 9 16 Debtors amounts falling due after more than one year interest bearing 2 4 103 95 The cash and bank balances comprise 21 million 2003 17 million in respect of balances earning interest at floating rates and 19 million 2003 25 million in respect of balances which are non-interest bearing.
The weighted average interest rate on the interest bearing cash balances is 3.76 per cent 2003 2.81 per cent.
In 2004 37 million 2003 13 million was held as term deposits with an average interest rate of 5.26 per cent 2003 10.53 per cent.
These deposits are held in Argentina, Brazil and Chile and the rate of interest reflects the high interest rates in Brazil offset by low interest rates in Chile and US dollar denominated deposits.
The remaining financial assets have not been further analysed on the grounds of materiality.
26 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT DISCLOSURES a Currency exposures The Groups objectives in managing the currency exposures arising from its overseas investments are set out in the Finance Directors Review on page 22 in the Annual Review.
Gains and losses arising from these currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The following summary shows the Groups currency exposures that give rise to currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account, arising from exposures where monetary assets and liabilities of the Group are not denominated in the operating currency of the subsidiary undertaking concerned.
Bracketed figures represent liabilities and unbracketed figures represent assets.

b Borrowing facilities The Group has various available borrowing facilities.
The undrawn committed facilities available at 31st March 2004, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, were as follows: 2004 2003 Group Group m m Expiring in more than two years 433 396 c Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair values of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties.
Market values have been used to determine the fair value of all swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
The fair value of all other items has been calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The following summarises the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities: Financial assets cash deposits and marketable investments The book value and the fair value equate due to the short-term nature of the investments.
Financial liabilities The book value of long-term borrowings amounts to 615 million 2003 770 million whereas the fair value amounts to 686 million 2003 824 million.
The difference between fair value and book value is due to the fixed rates of interest paid on long-term debt.
The book values and the fair values of all other financial liabilities, including non-interest bearing creditors and contractual provisions, are not materially different.
Derivative financial instruments Included in long-term borrowings above are cross currency swaps with a value of nil 2003 negative book value 14 million and a positive fair value of 7 million.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is 4 million payable 2003 5 million payable.
These are not recognised in the financial statements in 2004 and 2003.
The book value of the energy hedges amounts to nil 2003 nil whereas the fair value amounts to a gain of 3 million 2003 nil.
The book value of the forward foreign exchange contracts amounts to nil 2003 nil whereas the fair value amounts to a gain of 2 million 2003 nil.
d Hedges The Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures within the parameters set out in the Finance Directors Review in the Annual Review: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, cross currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Foreign currency transaction exposures using forward foreign currency contracts.
Energy exposures using commodity swap contracts for the appropriate fuel.
Gains or losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

These gains and losses will be matched by the gains or losses on the underlying instrument.

c Minority interests in German subsidiary undertakings In 1989 Pilkington Holding GmbH formerly Pilkington Deutschland GmbH made an offer to acquire the minority interests in Pilkington Deutschland AG formerly Flachglas AG and Dahlbusch AG.
If the remaining minority shareholders in these companies as at 31st March 2004 accept such an offer, the cost will be e37 million 25 million in addition to the e143 million 95 million paid to those who accepted the offer prior to 31st March 2004.
Certain minority shareholders have legally challenged the offer as insuffcient.
In the case related to Pilkington Deutschland AG, the court has decided that the offer price should be increased from e295 per e26 share to e350.
The effect of this decision is to increase the amount payable to those shareholders of Pilkington Deutschland AG, who have already accepted the offer to purchase, by e9 million 6 million, and to increase the amount payable to the remaining minority shareholders by e6 million 4 million.
The court also decided that the guaranteed dividend, which was an alternative offered by Pilkington Holding GmbH to the minority shareholders, should not be increased.
The decision of the court is being appealed by Pilkington Holding GmbH and the minority shareholders and it is expected that there will be no decision by the appeal court before the end of 2004.
The court dealing with the Dahlbusch AG case has not yet issued its judgement.
A court appointed valuer has proposed an increase in the offer price of approximately 19 per cent and an increase in the guaranteed dividend of approximately 14 per cent.
These valuation opinions do not constitute rulings and are not binding on the court, which has asked the parties to review and comment on them.
Indeed, similar opinions were presented in the Pilkington Deutschland AG case, and rejected by the court in that case.
The court in this case is unlikely to issue its decision before June 2005, and any such decision would be capable of being the subject of an appeal.
d Class action complaints Since July 1997 Pilkington and Pilkington North America Inc PNAI formerly Libbey-Owens-Ford Co, together with four other major glass companies, unrelated to Pilkington, have received class action complaints filed in US Federal, California, Kansas, Oregon, Tennessee and Wisconsin state courts alleging violation of the US anti-trust laws by conspiring to fix US float glass prices and to allocate customers amongst themselves.
In June 1999 Pilkington and PNAI entered into a settlement agreement with the plaintiffs in the US Federal case under which Pilkington and PNAI paid an aggregate amount of US$17 million 9 million.
Pilkington and PNAI deny that they violated any anti-trust legislation and believe that they have good defences against these allegations.
The settlement was entered into in order to avoid the expense, inconvenience and burden of continued and protracted litigation.
A claimant, which opted out of the settlement in the US Federal case, is pursuing a claim, but the anticipated costs of settling such claim are not expected to be material.
The cases filed in the state courts have been settled or dismissed.
e Other guarantees and contingent liabilities At 31st March 2004 the Group has guaranteed, in the ordinary course of business, bank loans of 4 million to third parties 2003 4 million and 8 million 2003 nil in respect of joint ventures.
The Group had other contingent liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business arising out of guarantees and other transactions, some of which are the subject of litigation.
In the opinion of the directors, the outcome of such litigation will not have a material effect on the Groups consolidated financial position.

In the Groups financial statements at 31st March 2004 the special reserve is shown net of 236 million of goodwill, which arose on acquisitions occurring in the period from 1986 to 1995.
A court order permits an amount equal to any new share premium created to be transferred from the special reserve to the profit and loss account.
The Groups profit and loss account includes exchange differences amounting to 203 million 2003 228 million.
The balance on profit and loss reserve of 46 million, includes 203 million of unrealised profits, the residue of 157 million represents realised losses.
The profit for the year attributable to shareholders of the company was 22 million 2003 39 million.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 as amended, the profit and loss account of the company has not been disclosed in these financial statements.
The total net exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings less deposits amounted to a profit of 105 million at 31st March 2004 2003 profit 82 million, of which losses in the year of 33 million 2003 profits 54 million were offset in reserves and nil was charged to the profit and loss account in the year 2003 4 million charged to profit and loss account.

46 Pilkington plc Directors report and accounts 2004 38 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS The pension costs included within the financial statements are prepared in accordance with SSAP 24 and this will continue until FRS 17 is fully implemented to replace SSAP 24.
In the transitional period, FRS 17 requires companies to provide additional disclosures in respect of defined benefit arrangements.
The Group operates a number of pension schemes and similar obligations throughout the world.
Approximately 75 per cent of Group employees participate in defined contribution or government schemes, ten per cent are members of defined benefit schemes principally in Europe, North America, Australia and New Zealand and the remaining 15 per cent are members of the UK based Pilkington Superannuation Scheme.
Outside the UK, pensions provided by defined benefit schemes are based on employees years of service and average final remuneration.
Where the schemes are funded in advance, the assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
This does not apply in Germany or Austria where there are no separate pension assets, but provisions for the pension liability are held in those Pilkington subsidiaries accounts.
In addition to the pension arrangements referred to above there are the following additional arrangements: Post-retirement healthcare and life insurance benefits, principally in respect of employees, retirees and their dependants in the USA, details of which are referred to in note 27 a.
The Pilkington unfunded top-up arrangement for directors and certain senior executives is an unfunded unapproved retirement benefit arrangement providing defined benefits to members, whose earnings exceed the Inland Revenues cap on pensionable salary.
The Group charges the cost of the arrangement annually to the profit and loss account, as advised by the UK actuary, and holds these amounts as a provision in the balance sheet within pension provisions note 27 b. Statutory leaving service indemnity provisions are provided in respect of employees in certain European countries.
These are charged to the profit and loss account each year based on the service and salary of each employee and the provision is carried within other provisions note 27 e. a SSAP 24 pension costs The total pension cost for the Group is as follows: Defined benefit Defined contribution 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Europe 11 12 27 25 North America 2 4 6 8 Rest of the world 1 4 3 10 8 37 36 The pension cost in respect of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme in the UK amounted to 9 million 2003 8 million.
Independent actuarial valuations are undertaken at least triennially on varying dates for the Groups main defined benefit pension arrangements.
The actuarial assumptions used to calculate the projected benefit obligations of the Groups plans vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which they are situated.
The actuarial valuations, based on the projected unit method, assume, on a weighted average basis, that the investment return will exceed the increase in the future earnings by 3.7 per cent 2003 3.7 per cent.
The actuarial value of the fund assets of these plans was sufficient to cover 88 per cent 2003 82 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members.
This deficit includes a 4 million deficit on the unfunded German pension arrangements, which is being charged over the remaining service lives of the German employees at 1 million per annum.
In Germany, the annual charge to the profit and loss account amounted to 9 million 2003 9 million.
The charge is based on an assumed six per cent investment return, which is fixed by law but salary and pension increase assumptions are not permitted.
In addition, there is a deficit of 43 million on the US pension schemes which is likely to result in additional charges to the profit and loss account in future years commencing in 2004 2005.
The market value of the assets of the Groups principal defined benefit plans at the date of the latest valuations was 313 million 2003 321 million.
Total accrued pension costs amounted to 3 million 2003 3 million and are included in other creditors note 23.
Provision for the benefit obligation of the unfunded plans referred to above amounted to 139 million 2003 151 million and are included in provisions note 27 b. b FRS 17 retirement benefits Whilst the SSAP 24 disclosure and measurement principles have been applied by the Group in accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits, FRS 17 on retirement benefits requires additional balance sheet and profit and loss account disclosures, as set out ahead.
Pilkington plc Directors report and accounts 2004 47 Notes on the financial statements continued 38 PENSIONS AND SIMILAR OBLIGATIONS CONTINUED Group The disclosures set out below are divided between pensions, which cover the Groups defined benefit schemes and the statutory leaving service indemnity arrangements, and the Groups post-retirement healthcare arrangements.
For the disclosures made in respect of defined benefit pension schemes and the statutory leaving service indemnity arrangements, a further division has been made between these schemes and arrangements which are funded and those which are unfunded.
These disclosures match the Groups segmental disclosures between Europe, North America and the rest of the world.
All schemes and arrangements within North America and the rest of the world are funded, whereas some within Europe are funded and others are unfunded arrangements.
There are 2,986 employees in the UK and 11,890 pensioners who are members of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme.
Benefits payable are determined by reference to final salary.
However, under the trust deed governing the scheme, employers contributions are fixed at 10.5 per cent of pensionable salary for active members.
Under the deed the Group has no right of access to any investment surpluses but equally cannot be required to increase contributions to finance any deficits other than as may be required by legislation.
For this reason the trustees follow a prudent policy of management and the scheme is funded at over 1.5 times the minimum level at which additional funding would be required by legislation.
For this reason also, under SSAP 24, the scheme has historically been considered to be in the nature of a defined contribution scheme.
FRS 17 introduced new definitions for defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes but, unlike SSAP 24, it does not refer specifically to schemes such as the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme with features of both.
The disclosures required by FRS 17 for defined benefit schemes are given below in respect of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme but, as the Group has no right of access to the economic benefits relating to any surplus in the scheme, any resulting asset is not recognised.
Any deficit would only be recognised to the extent that Pilkington had a legal or a constructive obligation to meet the deficit.
Defined benefit pension schemes The FRS 17 disclosures are based on the most recent actuarial valuations as noted below updated by independent qualified actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31st March 2004.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their market values at 31st March 2004.

The defined benefit schemes are closed with the exception of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme, the UK unfunded top-up scheme, the Canadian retirement plan for salaried employees, and the Pilkington Australia superannuation scheme.
The German defined benefit pension scheme is closed to new members but continuing employees accrue pension rights covering their current employment.
In the schemes which are now closed to new members, the age profile of the membership is rising and therefore under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as members of the schemes approach retirement.

1,099 million represents the present value of the liabilities of the scheme as at the reporting date, and excludes discretionary benefit increases.
This reflects the nature of the scheme, whereby the employers contributions are fixed at 10.5 per cent of pensionable salary for active members and, under the trust deed, the employer cannot be required to fund any deficit, other than in accordance with legislation.

This nil STRGL charge is a consequence of the recognised balance sheet item remaining at zero over the year and the disclosed profit and loss account charge being equal to the contributions paid.
The experience gain based on the actual movement of the Pilkington Superannuation Scheme reflecting the real experience of the scheme would be 15 million.
