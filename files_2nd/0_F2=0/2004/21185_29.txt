The EEV methodology adopted is in accordance with the EEV Principles introduced by the CFO Forum in May 2004.
The Group has replaced the Achieved profits basis with the EEV basis of reporting as its main measure of performance for life and related businesses and comparative gures for the Groups 31 December 2003 supplementary financial statements have been restated accordingly.
The impact on the Groups consolidated supplementary reporting is to reduce shareholders funds as at 31 December 2003 by 413 million from 11,165 million to 10,752 and to reduce the Groups consolidated profit after tax and minority interest for the 2003 financial year by 49 million to 1,593 million.
The full impact of the adoption of the EEV principles on the Groups results for the periods ending 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004 is shown in the release to the market on 13 January 2005, Restatement of Avivas supplementary reporting to the European Embedded Value EEV basis.
The Groups revised approach to establishing economic assumptions specically investment returns, required capital and discount rates has been reviewed by Tillinghast, a rm of actuarial consultants, as part of the restatement of 31 December 2003 and 30 June 2004 comparative gures.
The approach is based on the well established capital asset pricing model theory and is in line with the EEV Principles and Guidance.
In addition, the results of our equity release business have been reclassied from non-insurance operations to life insurance operations.
This has resulted in assets, liabilities and operating profits being reclassied out of non-insurance segments and into life segments.
Comparatives for 2003 have been restated accordingly and the impact of the reclassication on consolidated shareholders funds and consolidated profit for the 2003 financial year end is nil.
In the directors opinion, the EEV basis provides a more accurate reection of the performance of the Groups life and related operations year on year than results presented under the modied statutory basis.
The directors consider that the EEV methodology is a renement to the Achieved profits basis previously adopted by the Group and represents the most meaningful basis of reporting the underlying value in our life business and the underlying drivers of performance.
This basis allows for the impact of uncertainty in the future investment returns more explicitly and is consistent with the way the business is priced and managed.
The results for 2004 and 2003 have been audited by the auditors, Ernst & Young LLP.
Their report in respect of 2004 is shown on page 146.
Covered business The EEV calculations cover the following lines of business: life insurance, long-term health and accident insurance, savings, pensions and annuity business written by our life insurance subsidiaries, including managed pension fund business and our share of the other life and related business written in our associated undertakings and joint ventures, as well as the equity release business written in the UK.
Covered business includes the Groups share of our joint venture operations including our arrangement with The Royal Bank of Scotland Group RBSG and our operations in India and China.
For our joint venture with RBSG, the goodwill arising on the acquisition of the associate company, RBS Life Investments Limited, is included within the Amortisation of goodwill on page 128.
In addition, the results of Group companies providing administration, investment management and other services and of Group holding companies have been included to the extent that they relate to covered business.
Together these businesses are referred to as Life and related businesses.
New business premiums New business premiums include: Premiums arising from the sales of new contracts during the period: Non-contractual additional premiums, including future Department of Work and Pensions DWP rebate premiums: and Expected renewals on the new contracts and expected future contractual alterations to the new contracts.
For products sold to individuals, premiums are generally considered to represent new business in certain circumstances, including where a new contract has been signed, or where underwriting has been performed.
Renewal premiums include contractual renewals, non-contractual variations that are reasonably predictable and recurrent single premiums that are pre-dened and reasonably predictable.
For Group products, new business includes new contracts and increases to aggregate premiums under existing contracts.
Renewal premiums are based on the level of premium received during the reporting period and allow for premiums expected to be received beyond the expiry of any guaranteed premium rates.
Foreign exchange adjustments Embedded value and other balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies have been translated to sterling using the appropriate closing exchange rate.
New business contribution and other profit and loss items have been translated using an average exchange rate for the relevant period.
The exchange rates adapted in this announcement are shown on page 76.
Methodology Overview Under the EEV methodology, profit is recognised as it is earned over the life of products dened within covered business.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of a policy is the same as under the modied statutory basis of reporting, but the timing of recognition is different.
Calculation of the embedded value The shareholders interest in the life and related businesses is represented by the embedded value.
The embedded value is the total of the net worth of the life and related businesses and the value of in-force covered business.
Calculations are performed separately for each business and are based on the cash ows of that business, after allowing for both external and intra-group reinsurance.
Where one life business has an interest in another life business, the net worth of that business excludes the interest in the dependent company.
132 Aviva plc 2004 The embedded value is calculated on an after-tax basis applying current legislation and practice together with future known changes.
profits are then grossed up for tax at the full rate of corporation tax for the UK and at an appropriate rate for each of the other countries, based on opening year tax rates.
Net worth The net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets, and consists of the required capital and free surplus.
The level of required capital for each business, which ranges between 100% and 200% of the EU minimum solvency requirement for our main European businesses, reects the level of capital considered by the directors to be appropriate to manage the business, allowing for our internal assessment of the level of market, insurance and operating risk inherent in the underlying products.
The same denition of required capital is used for both existing and new business.
The free surplus comprises the market value of shareholder assets in excess of local statutory reserves and required capital.
Value of in-force covered business The value of in-force covered business is the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate which incorporates a risk margin of the distributable profits to shareholders arising from the in-force covered business projected on a best estimate basis, less a deduction for the cost of holding the required level of capital.
In the UK shareholders distributable profits arise when they are released following actuarial valuations.
These valuations are carried out in accordance with statutory requirements designed to ensure and demonstrate solvency in long-term business funds.
Future distributable profits will depend on experience in a number of areas such as investment return, discontinuance rates, mortality, administration costs, as well as management and policyholder actions.
Releases to shareholders arising in future years from the in-force covered business and associated required capital can be projected using best estimate assumptions of future experience.
In overseas businesses generally there are similar requirements restricting payments to shareholders from life businesses.
The value of in-force covered business includes an allowance for the impact of financial options and guarantees arising from best estimate assumptions the intrinsic value and from additional costs related to the variability of investment returns the time value.
The intrinsic value is included in the underlying value of the in-force covered business using deterministic assumptions.
The time value of financial options and guarantees has been determined using stochastic modelling techniques.
Stochastic modelling involves projecting the future cash ows of the business under thousands of economic scenarios that are representative of the possible future outcomes for market variables such as interest rates and equity returns.
Allowance is made, where appropriate, for the effect of management and or policyholder actions in different economic conditions on future assumptions such as asset mix, bonus rates and surrender rates.
The time value is determined by deducting the average value of shareholder cash ows under these economic scenarios from the deterministic shareholder value under best estimate assumptions.
The cost of holding required capital is the difference between the required capital and the present value at the appropriate risk discount rate of the projected release of the required capital and investment earnings on the assets deemed to back the required capital.
Where the required capital is covered by policyholder assets, for example in the UK with-profits funds, there is no impact of cost of capital on shareholder value.
The assets regarded as covering the required capital are those that the operation deems appropriate.
The value of in-force covered business includes the capitalised value of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the extent that they relate to covered business.
This is referred to as the look through into service company expenses.
In addition, expenses arising in holding companies that relate directly to acquiring or maintaining covered business have been allowed for.
Where external companies provide services to the life and related businesses, their charges have been allowed for in the underlying projected cost base.
Risk discount rates Under the EEV methodology, a risk discount rate RDR is required to express a stream of expected future distributable profits as a single value at a particular date the present value.
It is the interest rate that an investment equal to the present value would have to earn in order to replicate exactly the stream of future profits.
The RDR is a combination of a risk-free rate to reect the time value of money plus a risk margin to make prudent allowance for the risk that experience in future years may differ from that assumed.
In particular, a risk margin is added to allow for the risk that expected additional returns on certain asset classes eg equities are not achieved.
Risk discount rates for our life businesses have been calculated using a risk margin based upon a Group Weighted Average Cost of Capital WACC.
The Group WACC is calculated using a gross risk-free interest rate, an equity risk margin, a market-assessed risk factor beta, and an allowance for the gearing impact of debt nancing including subordinated debt.
The market-assessed risk rate captures the markets view of the effect of all types of risk on our business, including operational and other non-economic risk.
The RDR is only one component of the overall allowance for risk in EEV calculations.
Risk is also allowed for in the cost of holding statutory reserving margins, additional required capital and in the time value of options and guarantees.
Hence to derive an RDR the Group WACC is adjusted to reect the average level of required capital assumed to be held, and to reect the explicit valuation of the time value of options and guarantees.
In order to derive risk discount rates for each of our life businesses, the adjusted Group WACC is expressed as a risk margin in excess of the gross risk-free interest rate used in the WACC calculation as described above.
Business-specic discount rates are then calculated as the sum of this risk margin and the appropriate local gross risk-free rate at the valuation date, based on returns on government bonds.
A common risk-free rate, and hence a common RDR, is used for all of our businesses within the Eurozone.
Additional country-specic risk margins are applied to smaller businesses to reect additional economic, political and business-specic risk.
Within each business, a constant RDR has been applied in all future time periods and in each of the economic scenarios underlying the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees.
At each valuation date, the risk margin is reassessed based on the current economic factors and is updated only if a significant change has occurred.
In particular, changes in risk prole arising from movements in asset mix are allowed for via the update risk margin calculation.
133 Alternative method of reporting Aviva plc 2004 Alternative method of reporting long-term business continued Participating business Future regular bonuses on participating business are projected in a manner consistent with current bonus rates and expected future returns on assets deemed to back the policies.
For with-profit funds in the UK and Ireland, for the purpose of recognising the value of the estate, it is assumed that terminal bonuses are increased to exhaust all of the assets in the fund over the future lifetime of the in-force with-profit policies.
However, under stochastic modelling there may be some extreme economic scenarios when the total assets in the Groups with-profit funds are not sufficient to pay all policyholder claims.
The average additional shareholder cost arising from this shortfall has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
For profit sharing business in continental Europe, where policy benets and shareholder value depend on the timing of realising gains, apportionment of unrealised gains between policyholders benets and shareholders reect contractual requirements as well as existing practice.
Where under certain economic scenarios additional shareholder injections are required to meet policyholder payments, the average additional cost has been included in the time value of options and guarantees.
Consolidation adjustments The effect of transactions between our life companies such as loans and reinsurance arrangements has been included in results split by territory in a consistent manner.
No elimination is required on consolidation.
As the EEV methodology incorporates the impact of profits and losses arising from subsidiary companies providing administration, investment management and other services to the Groups life companies, the equivalent profits and losses have been removed from the relevant segment non-insurance or fund management and are instead included within the results of life and related businesses.
In addition, the underlying basis of calculation for these profits has changed from the modied statutory basis to the EEV basis.
The capitalised value of the future profits and losses from such service companies are included in the embedded value and new business contribution calculations for the relevant territory, but the net assets representing historical profits and other amounts remain under non-insurance or fund management.
In order to reconcile the profits arising in the financial period within each segment with the assets on the opening and closing balance sheets, a transfer of modied statutory profits from life and related business to the appropriate segment is deemed to occur.
An equivalent approach has been adopted for expenses within our holding companies.
Components of life EEV return The life EEV return comprises the following components: New business contribution written during the period including value added between the point of sale and end of the period: profit from existing business equal to: the expected return on the value of the in-force covered business at the beginning of the period, experience variances caused by the differences between the actual experience during the period and expected experience based on the operating assumptions used to calculate the start of year value, the impact of changes in operating assumptions including risk margins: Expected investment return on the shareholders net worth, based upon assumptions applying at the start of the year: Investment return variances caused by differences between the actual return in the period and the expected return based on economic assumptions used to calculate the start of year value: and The impact of changes in economic assumptions in the period.
The life EEV operating return comprises the first three of these components and is calculated using economic assumptions as at the start of the year and operating demographic, expenses, tax and other assumptions as at the end of the year.

134 Aviva plc 2004 New business contribution The following tables set out the premium volumes and contribution from new business written by the life and related businesses, consistent with the denition of new business set out on page 132.
The contribution generated by new business written during the period is the present value of the projected stream of after tax distributable profit from that business.
New business contribution before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution after tax at the full corporation tax rate for UK business and at appropriate rates of tax for other countries.
New business contribution has been calculated using the same economic assumptions as those used to determine the embedded value as at the start of the year and operating assumptions used to determine the embedded value as at the end of the year, and is rolled forward to the end of the financial period.
New business sales are expressed on two bases: annual premium equivalent APE, the UK life industrys standard measure, and the present value of future new business premiums PVNBP.
The PVNBP calculation is equal to total single premium sales received in the year plus the discounted value of regular premiums expected to be received over the term of the new contracts, and is expressed at the point of sale.
The premium volumes and projection assumptions used to calculate the present value of regular premiums for each product are the same as those used to calculate new business contribution, so the components of the new business margin are on a consistent basis.
New business contribution is shown before and after the effect of required capital, calculated on the same basis as for in-force covered business.

Maintenance expenses in the UK reect the benefit of cost saving initiatives undertaken.
Exceptional expenses in the UK reect costs of 65 million for the restructuring of one business service division and one-off project costs of 88 million associated with the pace of regulatory change.
Mortality experience across our major businesses continues to be better than our assumptions for protection and annuity business in the UK and protection in continental Europe.
Lapse experience in the UK has been adverse and mainly relates to bonds, protection schemes and pension products.
In the UK, other experience profits include 29 million of profits arising from better than assumed default experience on corporate bonds and commercial mortgages.
Maintenance expense assumption changes in the UK reects the benefit of cost saving initiatives coming through.
The UK and the Netherlands include capitalised additional future project expenses.
Adverse lapse assumption changes in the UK relates to unitised with-profit bonds and unit-linked bonds.
In Ireland, lapse assumption changes have been made on unit-linked pensions business following recent experience.
Other operating assumptions in the Netherlands relates to positive changes in asset mix and tax reecting, in part, the fact that the embedded value of Delta Lloyd was previously assessed using a blended average tax rate of 25%, which is below the local corporation tax rate.
The calculation has been rened to tax all future profits at the full corporation tax rate at the beginning of the year of 34.5% and to allow explicitly for the tax benefit arising from investing in the 5% holdings investments in Dutch companies where at least 5% of the share capital is owned, on which all investment income is tax free.
This change results in a 53 million benefit.
France includes the benefit of tax assumption changes.
France has historically recorded favourable tax operating experience as a result of better than assumed tax on dividend income because the tax assumptions had been set at full corporation tax for all future profits, whereas in fact dividend income from subsidiaries is tax exempt.
In 2004, the calculation has been rened such that the future tax benefit arising from dividend from subsidiaries has now been recognised.
This change results in a 39 million benefit.

Exceptional expenses in the UK reect one-off project costs including those associated with the pace of regulatory change.
In the Netherlands, they relate to project costs in Delta Lloyd Life and development costs in Belgium.
Mortality experience has typically been better than anticipated in many of the Group businesses.
Lapse experience has been adverse in a number of businesses including on certain savings contracts in the UK.
In the UK, other experience profits include exceptional profits arising from better than assumed default experience on corporate bonds.
In France, profits relate to the benefit of lower tax charges on dividends from subsidiaries and to a lesser extent, one-off benets following the utilisation of tax losses.
In France, there is a 21million charge, mainly resulting from updated expense assumptions, following the revisions to the agreement signed between Aviva and the AFER association.
Expense assumptions have been changed primarily in Poland reecting improvements in efficiency.
Changes in the UK reect expected beneficial mortality experience for protection business.
In the UK, lapse assumption changes reect experience in savings contracts mainly on with-profits and endowment business.
Changes in the Netherlands primarily relate to increased annual management fees on unit-linked contracts.
138 Aviva plc 2004 Analysis of movement in life and related businesses embedded value The following tables provide an analysis of the movement in embedded value for the life and related businesses for 2004 and 2003.
The analysis is shown separately for net worth and the value of in-force covered business, and includes amounts transferred between these categories.
The transfer from life and related businesses to other segments consists of service company profits and losses during the reported period that have emerged from the value of in-force.
Since the look through into service companies includes only future profits and losses, these amounts must be eliminated from the closing embedded value.
All gures are shown net of tax.

The movement in the net worth from that previously reported under achieved profits is 146 million at 31 December 2003 and relates to the reclassication of NUERs VIF from net worth to the present value of future in-force.
The shareholders net worth is the market value of the shareholders funds and the shareholders interest in the surplus held in the non-profit component of the long-term business funds, determined on a statutory solvency basis and adjusted to add back any non-admissible assets.
Required capital, net of implicit items, of 4,362 million at 31 December 2004 31 December 2003: 4,114 million is included within the net worth.
The value of in-force covered business includes the effect of holding shareholders capital to support the level of required capital and allowing for projected future releases.
This impact reduces the value of in-force covered business at 31 December 2004 by 1,195 million 31 December 2003: 1,049 million.
Time value of options and guarantees The following table sets out the reductions to embedded value to allow for the time value of options and guarantees relating to covered business at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 by business units.

In the UK, this relates mainly to non-market value adjustment MVA guarantees on unitised with-profit business and guaranteed annuity rates.
In France, this relates mainly to guaranteed crediting rates and surrender values on the AFER product.
In the Netherlands, this relates mainly to maturity guarantees on unit-linked products and interest rate guarantees on traditional individual and Group profit sharing business.
The increase in the time value of options and guarantees from 232 million at 31 December 2003 to 274 million at 31 December 2004 is primarily due to the 60bp fall in bond yields in continental Europe during the second half of 2004.
The overall impact of the lower yields was an increase of 39 million.
The increased allowance in the UK largely reected the new business written in Norwich Union Equity Release.
In France, the allowance included in new business contribution of 10 million together with the impact of lower assumed bond yields of 7 million and a small allowance from Antarius in the acquired embedded value were partially offset by favourable investment variances, which reduced the time value of options and guarantees by 13 million.
In the Netherlands, the key impacts were the increase due to lower assumed bond yields of 21 million and reduction arising from the tax assumption change of 10 million.
The increase in Other Europe arose in our German business and reects the impact of lower assumed bond yields.

Principal economic assumptions deterministic calculations Economic assumptions are derived actively, based on market yields on risk-free xed interest assets at the end of each reporting period.
The same margins are applied on a consistent basis across the Group to gross risk-free yields to obtain investment return assumptions for ordinary shares and property and to produce risk discount rates.
Expense ination is derived as a xed margin above a local measure of long-term price ination.
Risk-free rates and price ination have been harmonised across territories within the euro currency zone, except for expense ination in Ireland where significant differences remain.
Required capital is shown as a multiple of the EU statutory minimum solvency margin.
Investment return assumptions are generally derived by major product class, based on hypothecating the assets at the valuation date.
Assumptions about future investment mix are consistent with long-term plans.
In most cases, the investment mix is assumed to continue unchanged throughout the projection period.
The changes in assumptions between reporting dates reect the actual movements in risk-free yields in the UK, the Eurozone and other territories.
This change reects the calculation renements now adopted for the intermediary division, described on page 137, and the reduction in corporation tax from 34.5% to 31.5%, which was effective from 1 January 2005.
In 2005, profits will be grossed up at the local corporation tax rate of 31.5% in the Netherlands, reecting the economic basis at the start of the year, increasing both reported pre-tax profits and the corresponding tax charge.
Where there are service companies, expense ination relates to the underlying expenses rather than the fees charged to the life company.
Future returns on corporate xed interest investments are calculated from prospective yields less an adjustment for credit risk.
Required capital in the UK is 200% EU minimum for Norwich Union Annuities Ltd and 100% for other companies.
Required capital in Spain is 125% EU minimum for Aviva Vida y Pensiones and 110% for bancassurance companies.
Other economic assumptions Required capital relating to with-profit business is assumed to be covered by the surplus within the with-profit funds and no effect has been attributed to shareholders.
Bonus rates on participating business have been set at levels consistent with the economic assumptions and Avivas medium-term bonus plans.
The distribution of profit between policyholders and shareholders within the with-profit funds assumes that the shareholder interest in conventional with-profit business in the UK and Ireland continues at the current rate of one-ninth of the cost of bonus.
Principal economic assumptions stochastic calculations The time value of options and guarantees calculation allows for expected management and policyholder actions in response to varying future investment conditions.
The management actions modelled include changes to asset mix and bonus rates.
Modelled policyholder actions are described under Other assumptions.
This section describes the models used to generate future investment simulations, and gives some sample statistics for the simulations used.
Two separate models have been used, for the UK businesses and for the Europe and International businesses, as these models better reect the characteristics of the businesses.
UK Model Overall asset returns have been generated assuming that the portfolio total return has a lognormal distribution.
The mean and standard deviation of the overall asset return have been calculated using the asset mix of the fund and assumptions over the mean and standard deviation of each asset class, together with correlations between them.
Asset classes The significant asset classes for UK participating business are equities, property and long-term xed rate bonds.
Summary statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations StDev of future returns at 31 December 2004 for the three most significant asset classes: Mean StDev Equities 7.6% 20.0% Property 6.6% 15.0% Government bonds 4.6% 2.5% Means have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, averaging the accumulation across all simulations, and converting the result to an equivalent annual rate by taking the nth root of the average accumulation minus one.
Standard deviations have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, taking the natural logarithm of the result, calculating the variance of this statistic, dividing by the projection period n years and taking the square root.
This makes the result comparable to implied volatilities quoted in investment markets.
142 Aviva plc 2004 For the UK, the statistics are the same over all projection horizons.
The low assumed volatility for bonds reects the degree of matching, by duration, with the liabilities.
Assumptions are also required for correlations between asset classes.
These have been set based on an internal assessment of historical data.
Returns for corporate xed interest investments in each scenario are equal to the return on Government bonds plus a xed additional amount, based on current spreads less a margin for credit risk.
Europe and International Model excluding UK Government nominal interest rates are generated by a model that projects a full yield curve at annual intervals.
The model assumes that the logarithm of the short rate follows a mean reverting process subject to two normally distributed random shocks.
This ensures that nominal interest rates are always positive, the distribution of future interest rates remains credible, and the model can be calibrated to give a good t to the initial yield curve.
The total annual return on equities is calculated as the return on one-year bonds plus an excess return.
The excess return is assumed to have a lognormal distribution.
The model also generates property total returns and real yield curves, although these are not significant asset classes for Aviva outside the UK.
Asset classes The most important assets are xed rate bonds of various durations.
In some businesses equities are also an important asset class.
Summary statistics The following table sets out the means and standard deviations of future euro returns at 31 December 2004 for the three most significant asset classes: equities, short-term bonds dened to be of one-year duration and long-term bonds dened to be 10 year zero coupon bonds.
In the accumulation of 10 year bonds, it is assumed that these are held for one year, sold as nine-year bonds then the proceeds are reinvested in 10-year bonds, although in practice businesses follow more complex asset strategies or tend to adopt a buy and hold strategy.
Correlations between asset classes have been set using the same approach as described for the UK.
5 year return 10 year return 20 year return Mean StDev Mean StDev Mean StDev Short Government bonds 2.9% 1.6% 3.5% 3.5% 4.2% 6.8% Long Government bonds 3.5% 4.7% 4.1% 3.7% 4.6% 4.1% Equities 6.2% 19.7% 6.7% 19.4% 7.1% 19.2% Means have been calculated by accumulating a unit investment for the required number of years in each simulation, averaging the accumulation across all simulations, and converting th the result to an equivalent annual rate by taking the n root of the average accumulation minus one.
Other assumptions Taxation Current tax legislation and rates have been assumed to continue unaltered, except where changes in future tax rates have been announced.
Demographic assumptions Assumed future mortality, morbidity and lapse rates have been derived from an analysis of Avivas recent operating experience.
Where appropriate, surrender and option take-up rate assumptions that vary according to the investment scenario under consideration have been used in the calculation of the time value of options and guarantees, based on our assessment of likely policyholder behaviour in different investment scenarios.
Expense assumptions Management expenses and operating expenses of holding companies attributed to life and related businesses have been included in the EEV calculations and split between expenses relating to the acquisition of new business, the maintenance of business in-force and project expenses.
Future expense assumptions include an allowance for maintenance expenses and a proportion of recurring project expenses.
Certain expenses of an exceptional nature, when they occur, are identied separately and are generally charged as incurred.
No future productivity gains have been anticipated.
Where subsidiary companies provide administration, investment management or other services to businesses included in the EEV calculations, the value of profits or losses arising from these services have been included in the embedded value and new business contribution.
Other It has been assumed that there will be no changes to the methods and bases used to calculate the statutory technical provisions and current surrender values, except where driven by varying future investment conditions under stochastic economic scenarios.
Sensitivity analysis economic assumptions The tables below show the sensitivity of the embedded value as at 31 December 2004 and the new business contribution before the effect of required capital for the full year 2004 to: One percentage point increase and decrease in the discount rates: One percentage point increase and decrease in interest rates, including all consequential changes assumed investment returns for all asset classes, market values of xed interest assets, risk discount rates : One percentage point increase and decrease in the assumed investment returns for equity and property investments, excluding any consequential changes to the risk discount rate: 10% rise and fall in market value of equity and property assets not applicable for new business contribution : and Decrease in the level of required capital to 100% EU minimum or equivalent not applicable for new business contribution.
In each sensitivity calculation, all other assumptions remain unchanged except where they are directly affected by the revised economic conditions.
For example, future bonus rates are automatically adjusted to reect sensitivity changes to future investment returns.

In addition, other factors can have a material impact, such as the nature of options and guarantees as well as the types of investments held.
The interest rate sensitivity will vary signicantly by territory, depending on the type of business written: for example, where non-profit business is well matched by backing assets, the favourable impact of reducing the risk discount rate is the dominant factor.
Sensitivities will also vary according to the current economic assumptions, mainly due to the impact of changes to both the intrinsic cost and time value of options and guarantees.
Options and guarantees are the main reason for the asymmetry of the sensitivities, where the guarantee impacts to different extents under the different scenarios.
This can be seen in the sensitivity of a 1% movement in the interest rate for the Netherlands, where there is a significant amount of business with investment return guarantees.
The reduction of 60 basis points to the assumed pre-tax investment returns at 31 December 2004 has signicantly increased the sensitivity, reecting the level of the guarantees relative to the interest rate assumption.
Sensitivities to a 1% movement in the equity property return will only impact the value of the in-force covered business, whereas a 10% movement in equity property values may impact both the net worth and the value of in-force, depending on the allocation of assets.
