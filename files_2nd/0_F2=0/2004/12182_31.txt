An asset of 37 million 2003 44 million has been recognised based on medium-term board approved forecasts which reflect the effects of recent restructuring and cost saving schemes.
A further potential asset of 90 million 2003 111 million has not been recognised due to the inherent difficulty in long-term forecasting and because certain taxation losses in the USA will time expire either 15 or 20 years after they originally arose.
Other deferred tax assets arise, amounting to 9 million 2003 25 million and are recognised in full based on forecasted taxable profits.
Other unrecognised deferred tax assets amounting to 16 million 2003 14 million are not currently considered to be recoverable and have not been accounted for as assets.
Such assets will be recognised when future board approved forecasts support the generation of future taxable profits.
The Group expects that the effective tax rate of 34 per cent applied to the 2004 profits will continue to reduce marginally in the future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
