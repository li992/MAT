Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 19 Borrowings continued e Borrowing facilities At 2 January 2005, the Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities analysed as follows: 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Expiring Expiring between Extending within one and beyond one year two years two years m m m m m m Revolving Credit Facility 115 1,042 1,264 Commercial paper back-up facilities 31 46 The Revolving Credit Facility is for USD2,000 million 1,042 million expiring in December 2007.
The margins payable on drawings under this facility are between 0.5% and 0.65% per annum and commitment fees on undrawn amounts are between 0.2% and 0.26% per annum.
The Group is subject to a restrictive covenant under the facility agreement requiring that the ratio of EBITDA to adjusted net interest both as defined in the agreement, calculated as at the end of each half year and full year will be no less than 3.5:1 for the period of approximately twelve months ending on the last day of the end of each half year and full year.
The Group is currently in compliance with this covenant.
For the 2004 financial year end the ratio was 6.2 times.
These facilities are subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.
The commercial paper back-up facilities are annual facilities subject to review at various dates during each year.
There are in addition other uncommitted facilities available to the Group.
20 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments a Treasury Risk Management The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international business.
Derivative financial instruments are utilised by the Group to lower funding costs, to diversify sources of funding, to alter interest rate exposures arising from mismatches between assets and liabilities or to achieve greater certainty of future costs.
These instruments are entered into in accordance with policies approved by the Board of Directors and are subject to regular review and internal audit.
Substantially all financial instruments hedge for UK GAAP purposes specifically identified actual or anticipated transactions: movements in their fair value are highly negatively correlated with movements in the fair value of the transactions being hedged and the term of such instruments is not greater than the term of such transactions or any anticipated refinancing or extension of them.
Such anticipated transactions are all in the normal course of business and the Group is of the opinion that it is highly probable that they will occur.
Liquidity Risk The Group seeks to achieve a balance between certainty of funding, even at difficult times for the markets or the Group, and a flexible, cost-effective borrowings structure.
The policy, therefore, seeks to ensure that at a minimum all projected net borrowing needs are covered by committed facilities.
Also, the objective for debt maturities is to ensure that the amount of debt maturing in any one year is not beyond the Groups means to repay and refinance.
To this end the policy provides that at least 75% of year end net debt should have a maturity of one year or more and at least 50%, three years or more.
Committed but undrawn facilities are taken into account for this test.
Interest Rate Risk The Group has an exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and manages these by the use of interest rate swaps, cross currency interest rate swaps, forward rate agreements and interest rate caps.
The objectives for the mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings are set to reduce the impact of an upward change in interest rates while enabling benefits to be enjoyed if interest rates fall.
Thus the policy sets minimum and maximum levels of the total of net debt and preferred securities permitted to be at fixed rates in various time bands, ranging from 50% to 100% for the period up to six months, to 0% to 30% when over five years.
126 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Currency Risk The Group operates internationally giving rise to exposure from changes in foreign exchange rates, particularly the US dollar.
The Group does not hedge translation exposure and earnings because any benefit obtained from such hedging can only be temporary.
The Group seeks to relate the structure of borrowings to the trading cash flows that service them and the Groups policy is to maintain broadly similar fixed charge cover ratios for each currency bloc.
Also, the ratio for any currency bloc may not fall below two times in any calendar year.
This is achieved by raising funds in different currencies and through the use of hedging instruments such as swaps.
The Group also has transactional currency exposures arising from its international trade.
The Groups policy is to take forward cover for all forecasted receipts and payments for as far ahead as the pricing structures are committed, subject to a minimum of three months cover.
The Group makes use of the forward foreign exchange markets to hedge its exposures.
Commodity Risk In respect of commodities the Group enters into forward and future contracts for cocoa and other commodities in order to provide a stable cost base for marketing finished products.
A significant proportion of these forward contracts is held in the form of cocoa futures, which subsequently can be converted into physical supply contracts with commercial suppliers.
The use of futures contracts enables the Group to obtain the benefit of guaranteed contract performance on firm priced contracts offered by the exchanges and their clearing houses.
Credit Risk The Group is exposed to credit related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but it does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations given the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with high credit ratings.
The credit exposure of interest rate and foreign exchange contracts is represented by the fair value of contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date.
b Interest rate and currency of borrowings After taking into account the various interest rate and currency swaps entered into by the Group, the effective currency and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings were as follows: At 2 January 2005: Cash Effect of 2004 Floating rate Fixed rate and liquid currency Total net borrowings borrowings resources swaps borrowings m m m m m Sterling 333 410 96 561 1,208 Euro 327 653 65 298 617 US Dollar Bloc 14 2,066 42 99 1,939 Australia New Zealand Dollars 47 139 24 4 158 Others 216 11 119 160 52 937 3,279 346 3,870 At 28 December 2003: Cash Effect of 2003 Floating rate Fixed rate and liquid currency Total net borrowings borrowings resources swaps borrowings m m m m m Sterling 256 410 206 659 1,119 Euro 979 158 59 493 585 US Dollar Bloc 94 2,309 39 9 2,355 Australia New Zealand Dollars 109 96 33 61 233 Others 231 2 96 218 81 1,669 2,975 433 4,211 Floating rate borrowings bear interest based on short-term inter-bank rates principally LIBOR applicable to periods of three months or less or commercial paper rates.
The cash and liquid resources, which are all at floating rates, yield interest based principally on short-term inter-bank rates principally LIBOR applicable to periods of three months or less.

d Currency analysis of net assets As explained in the Operating and Financial Review, where practicable it is the Groups policy to hedge all exposure to monetary assets and liabilities fully.
Foreign currency assets and liabilities do not generate any material gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
This is either because they are denominated in the functional currency of the operating company in which they arise, or have been hedged into that currency, or because they qualify under SSAP 20.
The Groups borrowings and net assets by currency at 2 January 2005 were as follows: 2004 2003 Net Net Net Net assets by external assets by external currency of borrowings Net currency of borrowings Net operations a by currency investments operations a by currency investments m m m m m m Sterling 142 1,208 1,066 231 1,119 888 Euro 1,393 617 776 1,283 585 698 US Dollar Bloc 3,545 1,939 1,606 3,862 2,355 1,507 Australia New Zealand Dollars 283 158 125 373 233 140 Others 1,525 52 1,577 1,430 81 1,511 6,888 3,870 3,018 7,179 4,211 2,968 a Net assets as stated exclude net borrowings and include equity minority interests.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 129 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 20 Derivatives and other Financial Instruments continued e Interest Rate Risk Management The Group uses a combination of long-term and short-term cross currency and interest rate swaps to manage the currency and interest rate profile of its borrowings.
The aggregate currency impact of these swaps is shown in Note 20 b above.
Details of the fixed rate element of the swap portfolio are shown in the table below: Analysis of Derivative Instruments Weighted Weighted average average Notional interest remaining Final principal rate maturity maturity m % Years Year Currency Instrument Sterling: Receive Fixed 250 4.94 3.5 2006-2010 Euro: Receive Fixed 104 3.60 0.9 2005-2007 Pay Fixed 299 5.14 4.8 2005-2009 US Dollar: Receive Fixed 1,094 3.63 2.4 2005-2008 Pay Fixed 1,354 3.74 2.7 2005-2008 Other: Receive Fixed 167 2.13 2.0 2005-2008 Pay Fixed 139 5.17 1.5 2005-2007 Forward Start Pay Fixed 2005-06 76 5.51 0.7 2006-2007 On swaps where fixed rates of interest are payable, the Group receives interest at floating rates of three month or six month LIBOR rates or local equivalent.
On swaps where fixed rates of interest are received, the Group pays interest at floating rates set at three month or six month LIBOR plus an average margin of 0.59%.
The differential to be paid or received on swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and is recognised within net interest expense over the lives of the respective agreements.
Any net asset or liability arising on conversion into sterling of the principal amounts of cross currency swaps is included on the Balance Sheet see Note 19.
In addition to the above, the Group also has in place a number of cross-currency swaps which effectively swap floating rate Medium Term Note funding from Hong Kong Dollars and Japanese Yen with a value of 39 million to three month floating rate US Dollar LIBOR plus an average margin of 0.01%.
f Fair values of financial instruments The comparison of book and fair values of all the Group's financial instruments is set out below.
The estimated fair value of cash at bank and in hand approximates its carrying value due to its short maturity.
The fair value of liquid resources approximates their carrying values due to their short maturities.
The fair values of debt are based on, where available, market values.
In the absence of market values they have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
The fair values of derivative instruments are based on the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay if the transaction was terminated, taking into account prevailing interest and exchange rates.
130 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 The fair values of the quarterly income preference securities are based on market values.

g Hedges of future transactions The Group enters into forward foreign currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies.
It also uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
An analysis of these unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: Total net gains Gains Losses losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 28 December 2003 40 70 30 Gains and losses arising before 28 December 2003 that were recognised in 2004 26 32 6 Gains and losses arising before 28 December 2003 that were not recognised in 2004 14 38 24 Gains and losses arising in 2004 that were not recognised in 2004 17 27 10 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 2 January 2005 31 65 34 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 27 48 21 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 4 17 13 The Group held contracts to exchange the following foreign currency amounts: Contract Amount 2004 2003 m m Contracts to sell foreign currency against sterling 322 327 Contracts to purchase foreign currency against sterling 642 787 Contracts to sell purchase foreign currency against other foreign currency 548 303 Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 131
