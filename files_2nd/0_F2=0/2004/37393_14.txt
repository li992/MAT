Currency risk Structural As a result of the significant investment in its Euro zone subsidiaries, the Groups balance sheet could be signicantly affected by movements in the Euro Sterling exchange rate.
The Group has not sought to hedge against this structural currency risk due to the reasonably stable nature of the relationship between the two currencies.
Other operations denominated in foreign currencies giving rise to structural currency exposure are not significant to the Group currently, and as such the Group does not hedge against these currency risks.
Transactional The Group faces transactional exposure in respect of costs and revenues that are not denominated in the functional currency of the transacting company see table below.
The Groups policy is to hedge against significant currency exposures.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the hedged position is recognised.
