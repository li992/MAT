qxp 2 3 05 11:13 pm Page 90 90 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES INTRODUCTION The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources estimates presented in this report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc AA plc Policy for the Reporting of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources.
This policy requires that the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 2004 edition the JORC Code be used as a minimum standard.
Some AA plc subsidiary companies have a primary listing in South Africa where public reporting is carried out according to the South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves the SAMREC Code.
The SAMREC Code is similar to the JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology appearing in this section follows the definitions in both the JORC 2004 and SAMREC Codes.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the JORC or SAMREC Codes.
All Competent Persons have sufficient experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit under consideration and to the activity which he she is undertaking.
All the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the matters based on their information in the form and context in which it appears.
The names of the Competent Persons are lodged with the AA plc company secretaries in London and are available on request.
Anglo American Group Companies are subject to a comprehensive programme of audits aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates.
The audits are conducted by people who qualify as Competent Persons from within a particular division, from another division of the Company or from independent consultants.
The frequency and depth of the audits is a function of the risks uncertainties associated with the estimates of a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource, the overall value thereof and the time that has lapsed since an independent third party audit has been conducted.
Those operations projects subject to recent independent, third party audits are indicated in footnotes to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require the use of reasonable economic assumptions.
These include long-range commodity price and exchange rate forecasts, which are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future supply and demand and long-term economic outlooks.
Ore Reserves are dynamic and are influenced by changing economic conditions, technical issues, environmental regulations and additional information and therefore estimates can vary from year to year.
Mineral Resource estimates tend to be influenced mostly by additional information and transfers to Ore Reserves.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are as at 31 December 2004.
Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources are additional to Ore Reserves.
The figures in the tables have been rounded and, if used to derive totals and averages, could cause minor computational differences.
qxp 3 3 05 9:33 pm Page 91 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 91 PLATINUM stated as at 31 December 2004.
The Groups Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves The JORC Code, 2004 as a minimum standard.
Where relevant, the estimates were also prepared in compliance with regional codes and requirements e. g. The South African Code for Reporting of Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, The SAMREC Code, 2000.
The Mineral Resources are additional to the Ore Reserves.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves unless otherwise noted.
AA plcs interest in Anglo Platinum is 74.84%.
1 4E PGE grade: sum of platinum, palladium, rhodium and gold grades in grammes per tonne.
2 The global tonnage and grade remain largely unaffected compared with 2003.
The proved reserves increased by 28% 20Mt.
3 The decrease in the tonnage by 6% 37Mt is partially due to the reallocation of reserves to resources and the narrower resource widths being modelled in the deeper areas at Union and Amandelbult sections.
4 Exploration results have generated improved confidence in the reserve.
These results account for the substantial increase in Proved Ore Reserves.
Finalisation of modelling of reserves in the PPL North project has had a major influence on grade estimates.
Within the PPRust open pit, material lying between 1.0 g t and 1.7 g t will be stockpiled on surface and does not report to reserves.
The Platreef is mined by open pit.
5 Tailings are reported separately as resources and reserves but are not aggregated to the global resource and reserve summation tabulations due to their significantly different characteristics and the calculation thereof.
6 Total Imperial units: tonnage is reported in million short tons Mton, grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t and contained metal in million troy ounces Moz.
During 2004 the geostatistical processes of the South African operations and projects were reviewed by an external third party consulting firm.
Joint venture agreements are still being finalised.
Once finalised, the above statement will be affected.
2 The additional 7% 95Mt of Merensky resources accrue from exploration results, refinement of modelling techniques, and the addition of various joint venture properties where finalisation of agreements have been concluded and other properties.
Similarly the grade has been positively influenced by the 2004 exploration results.
3 The decrease in total UG2 resources by 4% 115Mt between 2003 and 2004, is ascribed largely to the restatement of the Pandora JV following the conclusion of a joint venture.
Anglo Platinums attributable percentage changed from 100% to 42.5%.
The balance of the variance is determined by dilution due to other joint ventures and exploration results.
The measured and indicated categories of resources have increased significantly.
4 Exploration results have allowed for a deepening of the resource envelope with a significant improvement in the lateral extent of the defined resources as well.
This accounts for the substantial increase in the measured resources.
Finalisation of resources in the PPR North project has had a major influence in tonnage and grade estimates.
Within the PPRust open pit, material lying between 1 g t and 1.7 g t, will be stockpiled on surface and reports to measured and indicated resources.
5 Tailings are reported separately as resources and reserves but are not aggregated to the global resource and reserve summation tabulations due to their significantly different characteristics.
2 Total Imperial units: tonnage in million short tons Mton, grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t and contained metal in million troy ounces Moz.
3 Following the finalisation of an agreement Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50%.
Only the attributable interest is reported.
4 Following the finalisation of an agreement Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 35%.
While the reef style is currently listed as Platreef, the use of this nomenclature is under discussion with Ridge Mining plc and a later revision of the term Platreef is anticipated.
Only the attributable interest in Shebas Ridge is reported.
5 Anglo Platinum holds an attributable interest of 50% in River Valley, only the attributable interest is reported.
6 The grade is reported as 3E: sum of platinum, palladium and gold grades in grammes per tonne.
qxp 3 3 05 9:40 pm Page 94 94 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2004 ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES CONTINUED GOLD stated as at 31 December 2004.
In determining the economic parameters to be used, AngloGold Ashanti has been guided by the preferred position of the SEC in the USA, whereby the economic parameters used are based on a three year historical average.
The figures reported represent 100% of the Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves attributable to AngloGold Ashanti.
AA plcs interest in AngloGold Ashanti is 50.97%.
1 AngloGold Ashanti reports Mineral Resources as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve figures JORC.
2 The large variance between the 2004 and 2003 figures is the result of economic scoping studies at WUDL, resulting in sub-economic areas being removed from the Mineral Resources.
3 The large variance between the 2004 and 2003 figures is due to the fact that AngloGold and Ashanti Goldfields each owned 50% of Geita Mine prior to the merger.
4 Total Imperial units: tonnage is reported in million short tons Mton, grade in troy ounces per short ton oz t and contained metal in million troy ounces Moz.
The 2004 Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of the following operations were audited by third party independent auditors: Sadiola, Yatela, Kopanang, TauTona, Obuasi, Iduapriem, and Cerro Vanguardia.

2 Includes 100% of Coal Reserves and Coal Resources of consolidated entities and the Groups share of joint ventures and associates where applicable.
Where the Groups share is more than 50%, 100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources are reported.
3 Coal Reserves are quoted on a run of mine ROM reserve tonnage basis, which represents the tonnes delivered to the plant, and on a Saleable reserve tonnage basis, which represents the product tonnes produced.
4 Yield percentage represents the ratio of Saleable tonnes to ROM tonnes and is quoted on an in situ to in situ basis or on an air dried to air dried basis.
5 The coal quality is quoted as a weighted average of the heat content of all Saleable coal products.
The coal quality for the Coal Resources is reported on an in situ basis.
6 Coal Resources are quoted on a mineable in situ MTIS tonnage basis in addition to the ROM reserves.
Coal quality parameters for Coal Reserves for trade collieries meet the contractual specifications for coking coal, metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal.
Coal quality parameters for Coal Reserves for power generation collieries meet the specification of the individual supply contracts.
In Australia, the finalisation of the Dawson Project resources and reserve statement is reflected in a gain in Coal Reserves for the Trade Colliery Reserves 44 million ROM tonnes 51% basis, a change in the Proved and Probable ratio and a reduction in the Trade Colliery Coal Resources and Other Coal Resources 28 million and 108 million MTIS tonnes respectively 51% basis.
The reporting of the Lake Lindsay Project Coal Resources reflects a gain of additional Coal Resources for the Trade Collieries 62 million MTIS tonnes 51% basis.
In Colombia, the change in the Proved to Probable ratio in the Trade Colliery Coal Reserves and the gain of additional Trade Colliery Coal Resources 277 million MTIS tonnes 33% basis reflects the result of the upgrading of the resource estimate in response to geological drilling at Cerrejn.
In South Africa, the conversion of resources to reserves at Mafube Colliery is reflected in a reduction in Other Coal Resources 68 million MTIS tonnes and the gain in the Power Generation Collieries Coal Reserves and Coal Resources 14 million ROM tonnes and 20 million tonnes respectively 50% basis.
In addition, 99.2 million saleable tonnes were depleted during 2004 by mining operations reportable basis.
The geological models for the following operations and projects were audited during 2004 by third party, independent auditors: Kriel, Cerrejn, Zondagsfontein, Saddlers Creek and Theodore North.

Where the Groups share is more than 50%, 100% of the Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are reported.
3 Los Bronces Reserves include 29.7Mt @ 0.97%Cu sulphides flotation and 20.2Mt @ 0.48%Cu low grade sulphides leaching to be mined from a third party mining property as an easement agreement.
The agreement that gives Los Bronces the right to mine and process these Reserves was signed in November of 2003 Acuerdo MARCO.
Sulphide flotation Reserves contain 0.015%Mo recovered as a by-product.
The infill drilling carried out during the year resulted in an upgrade of Probable Reserves to Proved Reserves.
The overall decrease in the sulphide flotation Reserves is due to a change in the cut-off grade which introduced changes in the geometry of the optimised pit.
4 El Soldado Oxide Resources and Reserves included in the mine plan amount to 1.3Mt @ 1.13%Cu.
5 Mantos Blancos loss of more than 10Mt of sulphide Ore Reserves due to reduction in current life of mine.
The life of mine is scheduled to end when the oxide plant runs out of material leaving only the sulphide plant.
The operation is not economic with just the sulphide plant producing.
The remaining material is reported as Mineral Resource.
6 ICu insoluble copper total copper less acid soluble copper, ASCu acid soluble copper, TCu total copper.
7 Mantoverde the dump leach Reserves have decreased due to depletion and transfer to heap leach Reserve as a result of a review of the marginal cut-off grade, and some material reclassified as Mineral Resource.
8 Collahuasi only the attributable tonnage and metal tonnes 44% are reported in the AA plc 2003 Annual Report 100% was reported.
Sulphide Reserves from Rosario deposit include 1045Mt @ 0.026%Mo to be mined and processed as from 2006.
Rosario low grade sulphide Reserves and all Ujina sulphides previously in the Proved category have been downgraded to Probable category due to uncertainties in long term modifying factors.
9 El Soldado sulphide Resources near mine exploration has resulted in an increase in the Indicated Mineral Resources.
10 Mantos Blancos the change in Resources is due to the transfer from Reserves to Resources and the lowering of the cut-off grade to the marginal cut-off value.
For this year's additional Resources, dump leach mineralisation outside pits has been eliminated.
This loss is offset by reporting vat leach material at a lower marginal cut-off grade.
11 Mantoverde for this year's additional Resources, dump leach mineralisation outside pits has been eliminated.
This loss is offset by reporting heap leach material at a lower marginal cut-off grade, i. e. transfer of dump leach material to heap leach material.
The Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources of the following operations were audited during 2004 by third party, independent auditors: Mantoverde and Collahuasi.

3 Increase in Ore Reserves are mainly due to a change in cut-off grade policy.
Mamatwan tonnages are stated as Wet Metric Tonnes, while Wessels is Dry Metric Tonnes.
4 Grades reported are beneficiated washed samples grades, as beneficiated grades are used in mine scheduling, quality control and blending rather than in situ grades and as such reflect a mineral product grade.
Yield cut-offs of 30% for massive manganese and 16% for loose pisolitic manganese are used in conjunction with lithology to further differentiate the ore waste envelope.
5 The Ore Reserve grades and tonnages are reported after crushing, washing and screening.
Some Probable Ore Reserves were transferred to Mineral Resources as they do not fall within the current mining authorisation.
6 Hotazel Manganese Mines report Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve JORC.
The increase in Mineral Resources is due to a lowering of the cut-off grade.
7 GEMCO report Measured and Indicated Mineral Resources as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve JORC.
8 The increase in Mineral Resources is due to the inclusion of underground resources after further investigation, and the transfer of Ore Reserves.
A total of 58 million tons of resources are the subject of old order unused rights as defined in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act and will expire with effect from 1 May 2005 and the decision was taken not to convert these rights.
9 Zimbabwe Alloys ZAL is primarily a smelting and refining company.
It obtains its ore feed from tributors and small scale producers, some of whom mine from their own claims generating the Ore Reserves.
The Indicated Resources include Eluvial Chromite Resources.
The 2004 Mineral Resource tonnage does not include 103Mt of low carbon Cr O material.

3 Status may change pending Kumbas appeal regarding arbitration.
4 Leeuwpans Coal Reserves have increased by just over 18% as a result of an increase in yield made possible by changes in specifications required by clients.
5 Kumba reports mineral sands Ore Reserves as the percentage total heavy minerals % THM within the Ore Reserves.
Individual valuable heavy mineral portions are reported as a percentage of the total heavy minerals except Gravelotte Sand which reports the percentage ilmenite in the Ore Reserve tonnage.
Ilmenite is estimated with more confidence than rutile and zircon in some deposits, which is reflected in the classification.
6 Kumba Resources report Mineral Resources as inclusive of those Mineral Resources modified to produce the Ore Reserve.
7 Increase is due to positive exploration drilling results, which led to the updating of Mineral Resource estimates.
8 The change in estimated Mineral Resources is the result of additional drilling and subsequent orebody boundary revision.
9 Braeburn and Fairbreeze C extension Mineral Resources subject to successful prospecting rights conversion.
10 Prospecting rights on the KwaZulu deposits Red Scar, Anmatikulu and Red Hill have been relinquished due to disappointing exploration results.
11 Plant fines from the production of metallurgical dolomite are sold as aggregate.
The ore reserves and mineral resources of the following operations were audited during 2004 by third party, independent auditors: Sishen and Inyanda.

2 The increase in Ore Reserves and additional Mineral Resources is due to a mining concession being granted for Area 5 during 2004 and the subsequent increase in the pit limits.
3 A drilling grid of 50m x 50m is now required to classify reserves as Proved and resources as Measured.
This has resulted in a reduction of the Proved Reserves but the total Proved plus Probable Reserves is not affected.
