Although these contracts were highly effective economic hedges, the strict requirement to document the methodology for ineffectiveness testing, should there be any, was not defined on inception of the hedge.
Compliance with the documentation requirements of FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities had previously been confirmed during the year-end audit.
The impact of the restatement was to transfer 14 million net of tax of deferred gains on derivative instruments to the income statement in 2003. a Pension costs There are differences in the methods of valuation required under UK and US GAAP for valuing assets and liabilities of defined benefit pension plans.
US GAAP is generally more prescriptive in respect of actuarial assumptions and the allocation of costs to accounting periods.
b Impairment of plant Under UK GAAP, an impairment provision is recognised when the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amounts of the related assets.
Under US GAAP, an impairment provision for assets is made when the undiscounted expected future cash flows fail to recover the carrying amounts of the related assets.
Accordingly, a US GAAP difference arises when the carrying amount of the assets is greater than the discounted future cash flows but less than the undiscounted future cash flows.
This difference in the carrying value results in different levels of depreciation under UK and US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP, an impairment may be reversed when the recoverable amount exceeds the carrying amount.
Under US GAAP, recognition of subsequent recoveries in fair value is prohibited.
Accordingly, the HUBCO impairment reversed in 2003 under UK GAAP is reinstated for US GAAP.
A portion of the impairment has been realised in 2004 on the sale of a partial holding in HUBCO.
c Purchase accounting and goodwill Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 April 1998, accounted for under the purchase method, is capitalised in the balance sheet and amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Prior to that date such goodwill arising on acquisitions was and remains eliminated against reserves.
Under US GAAP, goodwill arising on purchase business combinations is capitalised in the balance sheet.
With effect from 1 January 2002 goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting literature.
Goodwill impairments were recorded in 2003. d Development expenditure Under UK GAAP, the Group capitalises certain development expenditure as described in more detail in accounting policy note viii to the consolidated financial statements.
US GAAP required such costs to be expensed as incurred.
e Onerous property lease provision Under UK GAAP, a provision in respect of an onerous property lease is stated on a discounted basis.
Under US GAAP, this provision is measured on an undiscounted basis.
Accordingly, the impact of the discounting is reversed under US GAAP.
