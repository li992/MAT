32 Pensions The group operates a number of pension schemes in the UK, USA and Germany.
The principal schemes, based in the UK, are the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes.
These schemes are of the defined benefits type, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Contributions to the schemes are made in accordance with the recommendations of the schemes actuaries.
In addition, contributions are made to independently operated personal pension plans.
For the year ended 31 March 2004, the total pension cost for the group was 2.5m 2003 2.0m.
Pension cost relating to the principal UK defined benefit schemes is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, using the attained age and projected unit methods.
The latest actuarial valuations of the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes which are now closed to new members were at 31 March 2003, 1 October 2002, 6 April 2003 and 31 March 2002 respectively.
The main actuarial assumptions made in the valuations were that long term investment returns would be 0.25% to 3.60% per annum higher than the annual increase in pensionable salaries and that pensions would increase at the lesser of 5% per annum or the increase in the Retail Price Index.
The market value of the assets on the dates of the most recent actuarial valuations for the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal schemes totalled 10.5m, 6.9m, 3.1m and 4.6m respectively.
The levels of funding for the schemes shown by the valuations, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of accrued benefits at the valuation date, allowing for expected future increases in salaries, were 62% for Caledonia, 67% for Sterling, 53% for Amber and 91% for Edinburgh Crystal.
Contribution rates have been or will be increased to address these funding shortfalls.
The above actuarial valuations showed an aggregated deficit of 13.0m.
FRS17 disclosures Although the company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24: Accounting for Pension Costs, the following transitional disclosures are made in accordance with FRS 17: Retirement Benefits.
The group operates a number of defined benefit pension schemes.
The principal schemes, based in the UK and USA, are the Caledonia, Amber, Sterling and Edinburgh Crystal pension schemes.
Where appropriate, this note presents an aggregation of information for these schemes.
Full actuarial valuations of the Caledonia, Sterling, Amber and Edinburgh Crystal schemes were carried out at 31 March 2003, 1 October 2002, 6 April 2003 and 31 March 2002 respectively.
FRS 17 based analyses of the schemes at 31 March 2004 have been prepared by independent qualified actuaries.
All of the principal schemes are now closed to new members.
As a consequence, under the projected unit method, the current service costs will increase as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries in valuing the schemes liabilities were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 % %% Rate of increase in salaries 4.5 4.3 4.4 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 3.0 3.1 Discount rate 5.6 5.6 6.4 Inflation rate 3.0 3.0 3.1 Caledonia Investments plc 73 Annual report 2004 32 Pensions continued The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash flow projections over long periods and thus inherently uncertain, were as follows: Long term Long term Long term return return return expected Valuation expected Valuation expected Valuation at Mar 04 at Mar 04 at Mar 03 at Mar 03 at Mar 02 at Mar 02 %m %m % m Equities 8.1 30.3 8.2 22.7 7.4 31.8 Bonds 5.0 3.3 4.8 2.7 6.5 4.9 Other 4.4 2.6 6.1 4.3 4.8 2.0 Total market value of assets 36.2 29.7 38.7 Present value of schemes liabilities 51.6 48.5 44.0 Deficit in the schemes 15.4 18.8 5.3 Related deferred tax asset 4.6 5.6 1.6 Net pension liability 10.8 13.2 3.7 The analysis of movements within the schemes was as follows: 2004 2003 m m Analysis of amount charged to operating profit Current service cost 1.5 1.6 Total operating charge 1.5 1.6 Analysis of amount credited to other finance income Expected return on pension schemes assets 2.2 3.0 Interest on pension schemes liabilities 2.7 2.7 Net return 0.5 0.3 Analysis of amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses Actual return less expected return on pension schemes assets 4.4 11.8 Experience gains and losses arising on the schemes liabilities 3.0 3.5 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of schemes liabilities 3.4 5.0 Actuarial gain recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses 4.0 13.3 Movement in deficit during the year Deficit in schemes at beginning of the year 18.8 5.3 Movement in year Current service cost 1.5 1.6 Contributions 1.4 1.1 Other finance income 0.5 0.3 Actuarial surplus 4.0 13.3 Deficit in schemes at end of the year 15.4 18.8 History of experience gains and losses Difference between the expected and actual return on schemes assets Amount 4.4 11.8 Percentage of schemes assets 12% -40% Experience gains and losses on schemes liabilities Amount 3.0 3.5 Percentage of the present value of the schemes liabilities 6% 7% Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses Amount 4.0 13.3 Percentage of the present value of the schemes liabilities 8% -27% Caledonia Investments plc 74 Annual report 2004 Notes to the financial statements continued 33 Capital gains tax As stated in the Dun & Bradstreet Capital Gains Tax Service, the market value of the companys ordinary shares at 31 March 1982, adjusted for the capitalisation issue in August 1982 and the sub-division in July 1984, was 65.90909p.
34 Post balance sheet event Proposed elective special dividend On 15 March 2004, the company announced outline proposals for a return of funds to ordinary shareholders.
On 19 May 2004, a circular was sent to all shareholders detailing the proposals.
Subject to shareholder approval and certain other conditions being met, all Caledonia ordinary shareholders will be offered the opportunity to receive a special dividend on terms that they give up part of their shareholdings.
The special dividend will be set at a fixed discount of 18% to Caledonias net asset value per share, calculated as at a fixed date, expected to be 25 June 2004, and in accordance with the methodology set out in the circular.
Shareholders may elect to receive the special dividend on up to a maximum of two out of every nine ordinary shares held.
Shares elected for the special dividend will be cancelled for nil consideration.
The Cayzer Trust Company, the holder of 37.8% of the ordinary shares in Caledonia, has undertaken to elect for the special dividend in respect of its full entitlement.
Holders of 7.0% of the ordinary shares in Caledonia have irrevocably committed that they will not elect for the special dividend.
Based on Caledonias published unaudited net asset value per ordinary share of 1301p as at 30 April 2004, adjusted for the final dividend of 18.6p per share for the year ended 31 March 2004, and assuming overall levels of elections from either holders of 37.8% of the issued ordinary shares being the lowest possible level of elections or holders of 93.0% of the issued ordinary shares which, in the light of the irrevocable commitments referred to above, is the highest possible level of elections the cost of the elective dividend will be in the range of 64.1m to 157.8m.
For shareholders who choose not to elect for the special dividend, the net asset value per share attributable to their total shareholdings will increase by between 1.6% and 4.7%, depending upon the level of elections.
