Accounting Policies Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and with the applicable Accounting Standards of the UK Accounting Standards Board and pronouncements of its Urgent Issues Task Force, under the historical cost convention, as modified by the inclusion of trading positions at fair values.
The movements in the fair value of trading positions are included in the profit and loss account as described below.
The Companies Act 1985 requires certain movements in the fair value of trading positions to be taken to the revaluation reserve.
In so far as the adopted treatment of trading positions represents a departure from current statutory requirements, the directors consider this necessary for the financial statements to show a true and fair view.
The effects of this departure, which is consistent with industry practice, have not been disclosed, since the Company does not retain records on an historical cost basis, which would provide reasonable quantification.
Basis of consolidation The Groups consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 December 2004.
Interests in associated undertakings are presented in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 9, Associates and Joint Ventures.
An undertaking is regarded as a subsidiary undertaking if the Group has control over its operating and financial policies.
In accordance with section 230 4 of the Companies Act 1985 The Evolution Group plc has taken advantage of the legal dispensation not to present its own profit and loss account.
The amount of the profit after taxation for the financial period dealt with in the financial statements of the Company is disclosed in note 13.
Operating income In the opinion of the directors, disclosure of turnover is most appropriately represented for the Company by operating income, comprising profits from trading activities including dividend income on such trading positions and related foreign exchange movements, and fees and commissions receivable from corporate finance and asset management activities.
Fees and commissions are recognised in the profit and loss account when the related services are performed and when considered recoverable.
Operating income also includes interest receivable on segregated client money accounts.
This represents an adaptation of the profit and loss account format laid down in Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 due to the special nature of the companys business.
All operating income is generated in the United Kingdom and Ireland and is principally in sterling and is stated exclusive of value added tax.
Trading positions As noted above, proprietary trading and market making positions are stated at market value and profits and losses arising from this valuation are taken to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less provision for any impairment in their values and are written down to their estimated residual values over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Leasehold improvements Over 5 years Computers, software and similar equipment Over 3 to 5 years Fixtures and fittings and other equipment Over 3 to 5 years the evolution group plc 46 Report & Accounts 2004 Goodwill Goodwill arises under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations and represents the excess of cost over fair value of the Groups share of net assets acquired.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10, goodwill is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised over its useful economic life.
The useful economic life of the goodwill is determined at the time of the acquisition giving rise to it by considering the nature of the acquired business, the economic environment in which it operates and the period of time over which the value of the business is expected to exceed the value of the identifiable net assets.
For acquisitions, goodwill is generally expected to have a maximum useful economic life of twenty years and is subject to regular impairment reviews.
Impairment of tangible fixed assets and goodwill Tangible fixed assets and goodwill are subject to an impairment review in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 11 if there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill may not be fully recoverable.
The impairment review comprises a comparison of the carrying amount of the fixed asset or goodwill with its recoverable amount, which is the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
The carrying values of fixed assets and goodwill are written down by the amount of any impairment and this loss is recognised in the profit and loss account in the period in which it occurs.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments represent equity investments.
Listed and unlisted investments are stated at historical cost less provision for impairment in value, and are held for long-term investment purposes.
The Companies Act 1985 requires investments where there is significant influence to be treated as associated undertakings and to be accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The directors consider that in general the Groups fixed asset investments do not come within the Companies Act 1985 definition of associated undertakings, since The Evolution Group Plc does not exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of investees.
The directors consider that as these investments are held as part of the Groups portfolio with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, equity accounting would not give a true and fair view of the Groups interest in these investments.
The treatment adopted is in accordance with the accounting for venture capital and investment trusts as set out in Financial Reporting Standard 9 Associates and Joint Ventures.
The Company and Group did not have any significant interests in fixed asset investments as at 31 December 2004.
Consequently, this departure from the Companies Act 1985 has had no impact on the financial statements for the year.
Investment in associated undertaking Up until the disposal of shares in IP2IPO in May 2004 the investment in IP2IPO was treated as an associated undertaking in the Company and carried at cost less impairment.
In the Group accounts associates are equity accounted in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 9.
As at the year end the interest in IP2IPO is treated as a current asset investment in accordance with the policy below.
Fixed asset investment impairment provisions Provisions for fixed asset investments have been calculated in accordance with British Venture Capital Association BVCA guidelines issued in August 2003.
Early stage investments are valued at cost less any provision considered necessary due to performance significantly below the expectation on which the investment was based.
These provisions are made as a percentage of cost in 25% bands.
Later stage investments continue to be valued at cost less provision until a third party valuation or earnings multiple basis becomes more applicable.
Listed investments are valued at the bid price but may be discounted further where the holding is significant in relation to the issued share capital.
the evolution group plc 47 Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the Financial statements - continued Current asset investments Current asset investments represent equity investments.
These are held at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Own shares During the year the Group adopted the Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts UITF 38.
UITF 38 requires The Evolution Group Plc equity shares held in both the Evolution Group Plc Employees Share Trust and the Share Incentive Trust to be accounted for as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds, rather than as assets.
Cash balances held within either the Evolution Group Plc Employees Share Trust or the Share Incentive Trust to purchase shares in the Company are held at the value advanced and included within cash in the balance sheet.
Accounting for share options Share options issued under employee share schemes by the Group are accounted for in accordance with UITF Abstract 17, Employee Share Schemes.
The intrinsic value of the options at the date an award is granted is charged to the profit and loss account between the date of grant and the earlier of the options vesting date and the performance period to which the award relates.
The credit entry for the charge is taken to profit and loss reserves.
Pension commitments The Group makes defined contributions to employees' approved personal pension plans, and the costs of these are expensed when they are incurred.
Market and client balances In accordance with market practice, unsettled bought and sold security transactions with clients, stock exchange member firms and settlement offices are included gross in debtors and creditors respectively.
Operating leases Rentals applicable to operating leases where substantially all the benefits and risk of ownership remain with the lessor are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Investments in subsidiary undertakings Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at historical cost less a provision for any impairment in their value.
Details of the principal subsidiary undertakings are given in note 37.
Non-credit risk provisions Provisions are recognised for present obligations arising as consequences of past events where it is probable that a transfer of economic benefit will be necessary to settle the obligation and it can be reliably estimated.
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events or present obligation where the transfer of economic benefit is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured.
Contingent liabilities are not recognised, however, they are disclosed unless remote.
The Group accrues costs for dilapidations on its head office lease over the period of the property lease.
The accrual is based on expected costs to be incurred at the end of the lease period to bring the building back into a suitable state.
Credit risk provisions Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are recognised when the ultimate recoverability of outstanding balances is deemed uncertain.
The provision calculated is the amount required to reduce debtors to their forecast recoverable amount.
the evolution group plc 48 Report & Accounts 2004 Client money Money held on behalf of clients other than that required to settle outstanding bargains by the Group, in accordance with the Client Money Rules of The Financial Services Authority, and the corresponding liabilities, are not shown on the face of the balance sheet as the Group is not beneficially entitled thereto.
Foreign currency balances Foreign currency balances in the balance sheet are translated at the prevailing closing rate with the resulting gain or loss taken to the profit and loss account.
Profit and loss transactions are translated at the actual or average rate.
Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for under Financial Reporting Standard 19 'Deferred Tax' FRS 19.
This standard addresses the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities arising from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in the tax computations.
Deferred tax, provided at anticipated tax rates and on a non-discounted basis, is recognised in respect of all timing differences, arising from transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, which have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Assets are recognised on this basis only to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will crystallise in the future.
Change in accounting policy A change in accounting policy arose from the adoption in 2004 of UITF 38.
As explained in the accounting policy note above, equity shares held in the Share Incentive Trust are now accounted for as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds, rather than as assets.
The balance sheet for 31 December 2003 has been restated accordingly, and own shares and shareholders funds have both been reduced by 492,000.
The impact of UITF 38 on the 31 December 2003 profit and loss account was immaterial, and the comparatives have not been restated.
Accounting presentation Provisions for bad and doubtful debts are charged to other administrative expenses.
Amounts of 45,000 previously charged against operating income have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation.

Profit on part disposal of subsidiary The Groups stake in Evolution Securities China Limited ESCL was reduced in December 2004 following the deemed disposal of the holding by the Company, when ESCL issued 2,598 new shares on 13 December 2004, in which the Company acquired 1,625 shares at 192.49 per share.
In addition, in November 2004, the Company acquired 52 shares for 1.00 and 104 shares at 192.49 per share from other shareholders.
These transactions resulted in a profit of 23,000.
These transactions brought the Companys holding in ESCL down to 71.5% from 72.2%.
This followed the deemed disposal of the Groups holding from 75.0% to 72.2% calculated as at 30 April 2004 following the issue of 390 shares by ESCL on 22 April 2004 at 192.49 per share in which the Company did not participate, giving rise to a profit of 43,000.
