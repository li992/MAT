Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 30 June 2004 1.
Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice SORP for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies issued in January 2003.
The Financial Statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments.
b Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are treated as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no exdividend date is available dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The fixed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reflect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short-term deposits and interest payable is accrued to the end of the year.
c Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: expenses which are incidental to the acquisition of an investment are included within the cost of the investment: expenses which are incidental to the disposal of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds of the investment: expenses are charged to realised capital reserves where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fee has been allocated 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth: d Taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date, where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences arising between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial Statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The tax effect of different items of income gain and expenditure loss is allocated between capital reserves and revenue account on the same basis as the particular item to which it relates using the Companys effective rate of tax for the year.
e Investments Listed investments are valued in the Financial Statements at middle-market prices and unlisted investments at a valuation determined by the Directors.
In determining the valuation of unlisted investments the Directors adopt the middle-market price where a dealing facility exists and apply a discount if considered appropriate.
Where no dealing facility exists the factors to which the Directors have regard include, inter alia, the earnings record and growth prospects of the security, the ratings of comparable listed companies, the yield on the security, where appropriate, and any recent transactions.
f Borrowings Monies borrowed to finance the investment objectives of the Company are stated at the amount of net proceeds immediately after issue plus cumulative finance costs less cumulative payments made in respect of the debt.
The finance costs of such borrowings are allocated to years over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount and are charged 50% to revenue and 50% to realised capital reserves to reflect the Companys investment policy and prospective income and capital growth.

Derivatives and other financial instruments The Companys financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise securities and other investments, cash balances, liquid resources, loans and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement, and debtors for accrued income.
The Company also has the ability to enter into derivative transactions in the form of forward foreign currency contracts, futures and options, subject to Board approval.
The Company undertook no derivative transactions during the current or the previous year.
The main risks the Company faces from these financial instruments are i market price risk, being the risk that the value of the investment holdings will fluctuate as a result of changes in market prices caused by factors other than interest or currency movement, ii interest rate risk and iii liquidity risk.
In line with the Companys investment objective, the portfolio comprises UK securities and therefore has no direct exposure to foreign currency risk.
To mitigate risk, the investment strategy is to select investments for their fundamental value.
Stock selection is therefore based on disciplined accounting, market and sector analysis.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
The Attribution Analysis, detailing the allocation of assets and the stock selection, is shown on page 15.
The Investment Manager actively monitors market prices throughout the year and reports to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Current strategy is detailed in the Chairmans Statement on pages 10 and 11 and in the Investment Managers Review on pages 15 to 17.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks.
The Board has agreed the level of gearing which is presently 15% of net assets.
The Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the current and previous year.
The numbers in the table listed below exclude short-term debtors and creditors.
Market price risk The Companys investment portfolio is exposed to market price fluctuations, which are monitored by the Manager in pursuance of the investment objective as set out on page 1.
Adherence to investment guidelines and to investment and borrowings powers set out in the management agreement mitigates the risk of exposure to any particular type of security or issuer.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out in the Investment Managers Review on pages 15 to 17.
Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions as a consequence of price movements.
It is the Boards policy to hold equity investments in the portfolio in a broad spread of sectors in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specific to a particular sector.
A summary of investment changes during the year under review is shown on page 12 and an analysis of the equity portfolio by industrial classification is shown on pages 13 and 14.
Murray Income Trust PLC 47 Notes to the Financial Statements continued Interest rate risk Financial assets The interest rate risk of the portfolio of financial assets at the Balance Sheet date was as follows: Interest Non-interest Floating rate bearing bearing 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 238 4,651 2,745 4,589 387,259 336,200 US Dollar 1 1 239 4,652 2,745 4,589 387,259 336,200 The floating rate assets consist of cash deposits on call earning interest at prevailing market rates.
The interest bearing assets represent the preference share element of the portfolio.
The weighted average interest rate on these shares, which is based on the current yield, is 5.65% 2003 6.07%.
The non-interest bearing assets represent the equity element of the portfolio.
Financial liabilities The Company has floating rate borrowings by way of a loan facility, details of which are in note 11.
There is no difference between the value stated in the Financial Statements for the loans and their fair value as at 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2003.
As at 30 June 2004, the Company also had an additional committed facility of 5 million.
All other financial assets and liabilities of the Company are included in the Balance Sheet at fair value.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet funding commitments if necessary.
Short term flexibility is achieved through the use of committed loan and overdraft facilities.
Taxation There is no taxation charge for the year.
Approved investment trusts are exempt from tax on gains made within the fund.
The tax assessed for the period is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK.
2004 2003 000 000 Revenue on ordinary activities before taxation.

The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 9,431,000 2003 - 8,022,000 arising as a result of having unutilised management expenses.
These expenses will only be utilised if the tax treatment of capital gains made by approved investments trusts, or the Companys investment profile, changes.
