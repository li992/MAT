The guarantee was capped at US$2.77 million and was called during the year.
Investment Provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.

RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts 55 29 PENSION COMMITMENTS SSAP24 DISCLOSURE J. Rothschild Capital Management Limited has pension commitments in respect of its participation in the RITCP Scheme.
The Scheme has two parts: a defined benefit section which is closed to new members and money purchase arrangements which have been set up for Lord Rothschild.
The last actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the RITCP Scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2002 and the report was produced using the projected unit method of funding using the following main assumptions: Annual compound rate Investment return 6.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.50% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% Inflation assumption 2.00% Appropriate demographic assumptions have also been used.
At 1 January 2002 the market value of assets of the Scheme was 5.188 million.
Based on the assumptions set out above for determining the Schemes liabilities as at 1 January 2002, the funding level of the Scheme as at this date was 82% allowing for projected future salary increases for current active members.
Following the actuarial valuation the Company agreed to make lump sum contributions to the Scheme totalling 1 million over the period to April 2003.
A current funding level valuation considers whether the assets would have been sufficient at the valuation date to cover liabilities arising in respect of pensions in payment, preserved benefits for members whose pensionable service has ceased and accrued benefits for members in pensionable service, based on pensionable service to, and pensionable earnings at, the date of valuation including revaluation on the statutory basis.
Based on the current funding level methodology and financial assumptions set out above, the funding level of the plan as at 1 January 2002 was 91%, a deficiency of 0.499 million.
This is a measure of solvency that compares the assets of the Scheme with the actuarial value of the liabilities in respect of benefits that would arise if all of the members were to leave the Scheme at the valuation date.
The next formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme is due to be performed no later than 1 January 2005.
For the purposes of determining the pensionable expense for the Scheme in accordance with SSAP 24, the most recent formal valuation was updated to 1 April 2003 using approximate techniques, based on the following main financial assumptions: Annual compound rate Discount rate 5.50% Rate of increase in salaries 3.75% Rate of increase in payment of all pensions 4.00% Based on the attained age method, the pension expense for the defined benefit section of the Scheme for the year was 1.056 million 31 March 2003: 0.76 million.
This included 0.558 million 31 March 2003: nil in respect of the amortisation of experience deficits, assuming they are amortised over 13 years, the average remaining service lives of the employees.
The market value of the assets of the defined benefit section of the Scheme as at 1 April 2003 was 4.8 million.
Based on the assumptions set out above, the estimated ongoing funding level of the Scheme as at 1 April 2003 was 48% ie.
the ratio of assets to liabilities calculation on the ongoing basis.
The cumulative net pension provision for the Scheme was 0.339 million as at 31 March 2004 there was no provision at 31 March 2003.
The employer contribution rate to the Scheme during the year ended 31 March 2004 was 35% of pensionable salaries.
An additional contribution of 0.4 million was made in April 2003.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase arrangements was 20% of pensionable salary.
No changes have been made to these funding rates to date.
The employer contribution rate to the scheme for the period from 1 April 2002 to 30 June 2002 was 34% of pensionable salaries and the rate was increased to 35% for the period from 1 July 2002 to 31 March 2003.
An additional contribution of 0.42 million was made in July 2002.
An additional contribution of 0.2 million was made in February 2002.
The funding rate in respect of the money purchase arrangements was 20% of pensionable salary during the year ended 31 March 2003.
RIT Capital Partners plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 56 Notes to the Accounts 29 PENSION COMMITMENTS CONTINUED Since the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants, the service cost as a percentage of pensionable salary, calculated using the projected unit method, would be expected to increase as the current membership approaches retirement.
The pension contributions made during the year are analysed below: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2004 2003 000 000 Defined benefit scheme annual contributions 317 340 additional contribution 400 420 Money purchase scheme 68 64 Personal pension schemes 180 137 965 961 FRS17 DISCLOSURE In accordance with the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 17, Retirement Benefits FRS17, this note discloses the main financial assumptions made in valuing the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme and the fair value of assets held.
