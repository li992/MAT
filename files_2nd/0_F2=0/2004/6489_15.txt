23 Acquisitions and disposals The acquisitions in the fty two weeks ended 1 January 2005 were all accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting.

On 13 July 2004, Geest PLC acquired for 76,000 cash a 76% share in the equity of a new business called International Produce Limited International Produce.
The purpose of the business is to simplify the supply chain for imported produce to Asda Wal Mart Asda.
International Produce combines the current import activity of Geests English Village Salads Limited EVS a business dedicated to Asda and the business of Thames Fruit Ltd Thames an exclusive importer of citrus fruits and melons for Asda.
EVSs profit reduced as a result of the transfer of business to International Produce but the overall impact of the transaction on Geest in 2004 is a small increase in earnings.
As a result of the revised supply contract with Asda, in the second half of 2004, Geest accounted for sales for both International Produce and EVS for the supply of produce as if they were agents, which does not affect reported profits but reduces reported sales as follows: 52 weeks 53 weeks ended ended 1 January 3 January million 2005 2004 Produce turnover reported in these accounts 148.8 191.5 Produce turnover recorded on an agency basis consistently throughout the period 84.1 73.2 On 10 September 2004, Geest PLC acquired, for 14.2 million cash plus an anticipated 1.0 million deferred cash, 100% of the shares of Anglia Crown Limited.
The gross fair value of the assets acquired amounted to 2.6 million plus cash of 1.1 million, generating goodwill of 11.5 million.
On 26 October 2004, the Group entered into a joint venture with Rannoch Food Group Limited named Geest RFG Fresh Cook Limited Freshcook.
Freshcook is jointly owned and its principal activity is the production of ready to cook meals using raw ingredients.

Accounts and notes Geest PLC 59 25 Pensions Group The Group operates a number of pension schemes in the UK and overseas.
These schemes are either trust or contract based and have been set up in accordance with appropriate legislation.
The assets of each of the pension schemes are held separately from the assets of the Company.
In the UK, the two main schemes, one a dened contribution scheme and the other a funded dened benefit scheme, are open to employees joining Geest full time or part time.
Approximately 25% of eligible UK employees belong to a pension scheme.
Pension costs charged in arriving at profit on ordinary activities before taxation and exceptional costs were: 52 weeks 53 weeks ended ended 1 January 3 January 2005 2004 Restated million note 1 UK dened benefit scheme net charge 1.8 1.8 UK dened contribution scheme net charge 0.6 0.5 Overseas net charge 0.2 0.2 Total charge 2.6 2.5 No amounts were owing at the period end 2003: nil for the dened contribution scheme.
Dened benefit scheme The Group adopted FRS 17 Retirement benets for the year, which has required a change in the method of accounting for retirement benets.
Full details of the impact of this on the prior period results are given in note 1.
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based upon the latest full actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 and updated by the actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the assets and liabilities of the scheme at 1 January 2005 and 3 January 2004.
The fair value of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before they are realised, and the present value of the schemes liabilities, which are derived from cash ow projections over long periods and thus are inherently uncertain, were: 1 January 2005 3 January 2004 28 December 2002 Expected Expected Expected rate of return Fair value rate of return Fair value rate of return Fair value % pa million % pa million % pa million Equities 8.40 97.9 8.70 87.8 7.75 69.4 Corporate bonds 5.4 16.6 5.4 16.5 5.4 20.6 UK government bonds 4.8 4.3 4.8 4.2 Total market value of assets 118.8 108.5 90.0 Present value of scheme liabilities 116.8 110.2 90.2 Surplus deficit in scheme 2.0 1.7 0.2 Related deferred taxation liability asset 0.6 0.5 0.1 Net pension asset liability 1.4 1.2 0.1 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The schemes assets are invested in a mixture of UK and overseas equities plus UK bonds.
A variety of indices has been selected by the Trustees against which the investment managers must perform.
Overall, for the fty two weeks ended 1 January 2005, the combined fund return was 11.1% fty three weeks ended 3 January 2004: 21.7% against the combined index return of 10.2% fty three weeks ended 3 January 2004: 18.0%.

The assets of the Company sponsored pension arrangements are held separately from the assets of the Company.
Contributions are based on pension costs across the Group as a whole and the cost to the Company is based on a percentage of pensionable earnings.
The Company is the principal employer for the Group pension scheme and therefore has recognised the net pension asset liability on behalf of the Group companies.
However, it is not possible to identify separately all individual companies shares of the underlying assets and liabilities of the Group dened benefit scheme.
