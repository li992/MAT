The information for the year ended 31 March 2004 has been derived from 2003 information as adjusted for subsequent production during the year.
Basis of Preparation Ore reserves and mineral resources reported herein comply with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Identified Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves.
This Code is subtitled Report of the Joint Ore Reserves Committee of the Australasian Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Australian Institute of Geoscientists, and Minerals Council of Australia, and is commonly referred to as the JORC Code.
The edition of the JORC Code in force as at the date of this Annual Report is dated September 1999.
The JORC Code recognises a fundamental distinction between resources and reserves.
Mineral resources are based on mineral occurrences quantified on the basis of geological data and an assumed cut-off grade, and are divided into measured, indicated and inferred categories reflecting decreasing confidence in geological and or grade continuity.
No allowances are included for dilution and losses during mining, but the reporting of resource estimates carries the implication that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic exploitation.
Resources may therefore be viewed as the estimation stage prior to the application of more stringent economic criteria for reserve definition, such as a rigorously defined cut-off grade and mine design outlines, along with allowances for dilution and losses during mining.
Ore reserves, as defined by the JORC Code, are designated as proved and probable, and are derived from the corresponding measured and indicated resource estimates by including allowances for dilution and losses during mining.
It is an explicitly stated further requirement that other modifying economic, mining, metallurgical, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors must also be taken into account.
References to resources and reserves are to total resources and reserves respectively.
Total resources and reserves means that part of the resource and reserve from a mine in which subsidiaries of the Group have an economic interest.
The Group does not wholly own certain of its subsidiaries and therefore total resources and total reserves include resources and reserves attributable to third party interests in controlled subsidiaries.
References to production are to total production.
Total production means that part of production at mines and operations in which subsidiaries of the Group have an economic interest.
The Group does not wholly own certain of its subsidiaries and therefore total production includes production attributable to third party interests in controlled subsidiaries.
