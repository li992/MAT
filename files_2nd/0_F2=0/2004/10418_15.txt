com Notes to the financial statements 1.
Accounting policies Accounting conventions The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
These differ in certain significant respects from accounting standards in the United States of America and a reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America US GAAP is included in the Supplementary information for United States investors.
All principal subsidiary undertakings financial years are coterminous with those of mmO plc.
2 Basis of preparation Merger accounting On 19 November 2001, the ordinary shares of mmO plc were listed on the London Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.
2 This was the culmination of a group reorganisation undertaken by British Telecommunications plc BT to demerge its wireless business.
The financial statements have been prepared as if the mmO Group had been demerged from BT prior to 1 April 2001.
This presents 2 information which more accurately reflects the ongoing operations of the Group.
Accordingly the demerger and related transactions have been accounted for using merger accounting principles as applicable to group reorganisations.
The financial statements have been prepared using accounting policies which differ in certain respects to those used in the preparation of the financial information contained within the Listing Particulars of mmO plc dated 18 September 2001 the Listing Particulars.
In the Listing 2 Particulars, a portion of BTs shortand long-term loans and other borrowings were allocated to the mmO Group.
The basis of preparation 2 adopted for these financial statements shows the results and financial position of the Group with no allocations of loans and other borrowings from BT.
Loans and other borrowings previously allocated to the Group for the purpose of the Listing Particulars of 16,140 million and the related interest payable, net of taxation, of 476 million, have not been allocated to the Group for the purpose of these financial statements.
This is consistent with the debt structure of the Group following the completion of its demerger from BT and reflects the fact that these notional loans and other borrowings were not passed down to the Group on demerger.
The actual interest charge for the Group contained in the financial statements reflects the interest on the Groups actual borrowings in the year.
The financial statements include the results of mmO plc and its subsidiaries.
All intercompany accounts and transactions have 2 been eliminated.
Certain amounts relating to the prior year have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used when accounting for certain items such as provision for bad and doubtful debtors, depreciation and amortisation, valuation of inventory, pensions and other benefits, and asset impairment.
Turnover Group turnover, which excludes value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value of services provided, equipment sales and other revenue.
Mobile telecommunications service turnover includes turnover earned for usage of the Groups wireless network for voice and data transmission by O customers, subscription fees and interconnect revenue.
Post-pay customers are billed in arrears based on usage and 2 turnover is recognised when the service is rendered.
Turnover for pre-pay customers is recorded as deferred revenue prior to commencement of services and is recognised as the pre-pay services are rendered.
Inbound roaming revenue, earned from other mobile operators whose customers roam onto the O network, and outbound roaming revenue, earned from certain customers roaming outside their domestic 2 coverage area, are recognised based upon usage and are included in mobile service turnover.
Subscription fees are recognised evenly throughout the periods to which they relate.
Hardware turnover principally consists of revenue from the sale of wireless mobile devices.
The revenue and related expenses associated with the sale of wireless handsets and accessories are recognised when the products are delivered and accepted by the customer.
Other sales include connection charges which are deferred and recognised over the estimated customer relationship period.
Revenue is recognised on a gross basis where the Groups role is that of principal in a transaction.
The gross basis represents the gross value of the billing to the customer after trade discounts, with any related costs being charged to operating expenses.
Where the Group acts as agent in a transaction, the net revenue earned is recognised as turnover.
Accounting policies continued Subscriber acquisition costs Subscriber acquisition costs, which include the commission costs associated with acquiring new subscribers and other incremental costs of customer acquisition, are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development is written off in the year in which it is incurred.
Advertising Advertising costs are included in administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions adjusted for the effects of any hedging arrangements, except for material exceptional items which are translated at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
The balance sheets of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the closing rates of exchange and the differences arising from the translation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries at the closing rate are taken direct to reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The profit and loss and cash flows for the year of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the average rates of exchange for the year.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill Goodwill, arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings and interests in associates and joint ventures, represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired.
For all acquisitions arising on or after 1 April 1998, the goodwill arising is capitalised as an intangible asset.
The goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis from the time of acquisition over a period estimated by the Directors to be its useful economic life.
The economic life is normally between 10 and 20 years, subject to review if and when an event or change occurs which may affect the asset life.
Where applicable, goodwill relating to overseas businesses is held as a foreign currency denominated asset.
For acquisitions made before the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets, on 1 April 1998, the goodwill was written off directly to reserves.
The goodwill written off directly to reserves will be charged to the profit and loss account on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
Other intangible fixed assets Licence fees paid to governments, which permit telecommunication activities to be operated for defined periods, are capitalised at cost and are amortised from the later of the start of the licence period or market launch of service, to the end of the licence period on a straight-line basis.
Other licences are amortised over the period of the licence on a straight-line basis.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
The cost of tangible fixed assets includes directly attributable incremental costs incurred in their acquisition and installation.
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets from the date they are brought into use, in equal instalments over their estimated useful lives, taking into account any residual values.
The lives assigned to tangible fixed assets are: Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold land and buildings Unexpired portion of lease or 40 years, whichever is the shorter Network assets 5 to 15 years Plant and machinery 2 to 5 years Computers, software and office equipment 2 to 6 years Motor vehicles 5 years No depreciation is provided on freehold land or assets in course of construction.
Accounting policies continued Fixed asset investments Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
The profit and loss account includes the Groups share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.
Other investments held as fixed assets comprise equity shareholdings and other interests and are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Share scheme accounting Options and share awards granted over the Companys ordinary shares are accounted for using the intrinsic value method, with the difference between the fair value of the shares at the grant date and the exercise price charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period.
The Company partially hedges its future obligations under certain share awards by holding its own shares in the mmO Employee Share Trust.
2 Own shares are held at cost less amortisation charged to date.
Fixed asset impairment Goodwill and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment: i at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition: and, together with tangible fixed assets, ii in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Such events may include continuing operating losses, technological obsolescence or significant adverse changes in the business or the market in which the fixed asset is used.
The impairment review is performed by comparing the carrying value of the asset, or group of assets, with their recoverable amount.
For assets used in the continuing operations of the Group the recoverable amount is the assets value in use which is estimated by calculating the present value of its future cash flows.
For assets to be disposed, the recoverable amount is the assets net realisable value.
Impairment charges are recognised in the profit and loss account to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount in the period in which the impairment is identified.
Stocks Stocks comprise mainly handsets and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value which reflects the value to the business of the handset in the hands of the subscriber on a first-in, first-out basis, after provisions for obsolescence.
Debtors Debtors are stated at estimated net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the invoiced amount less provisions for bad and doubtful debtors.
Provisions are made specifically against debtors where there is evidence of a dispute or an inability to pay.
An additional provision is made based on an analysis of balances by age, previous losses experienced and general economic conditions.
Provisions Provisions are recognised by the Group when three criteria are met: i the Group has a constructive or legal obligation as a result of a past event: ii if it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and iii a reliable estimate of the obligation can be made.
A provision is made for the present value of the cost of restoration of mast sites at the date of acquisition of the site in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Post retirement benefits The Group operates a number of pension schemes as disclosed in note 29 to the financial statements.
All pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice SSAP 24 Accounting for pension costs.
The Group continues to apply the transitional disclosure requirements set out in FRS 17 Retirement benefits.
For funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes, the expected costs of providing pensions and other post retirement benefits, as calculated periodically by professionally qualified actuaries, are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service lives of employees in the schemes in such a way that the pension cost is a substantially level percentage of current and expected future pensionable payroll.
For the funded schemes, the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the principal employer.
For the unfunded schemes, no contributions are made by either employees or the employer to a separate pension fund but a provision is recorded on the balance sheet to recognise the cumulative accrued liability of the Group.
The Group also supports a number of defined contribution pension schemes where the benefits are based on the level of contributions paid.
Costs arising from these schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Accounting policies continued Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on all timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Debt issue costs Debt instruments are stated at the amount of net proceeds received.
Financing costs are amortised over the term of the debt to ensure a constant rate of charge.
Derivative financial instruments The Group considers its derivative financial instruments to be hedges when certain criteria are met.
For foreign currency derivatives, the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and whose characteristics have been identified.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
For interest rate derivatives, the instrument must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable commitment, such as a future bond issue, and must also change the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials, under interest rate swap agreements used to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are fixed, are recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
The forward exchange contracts used to change the currency mix of net debt are revalued at the closing rates of exchange with net unrealised gains and losses being matched to the underlying transactions being hedged.
The forward exchange contracts hedging transaction exposures are revalued at the year end at the prevailing forward rate with net unrealised gains and losses being matched to the underlying transactions being hedged.
Leases and hire purchase contracts Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal annual amounts over the periods of the leases.
Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the estimated useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Segmental analysis The Groups operations have been divided internally into three classes of business, in line with the day-to-day managerial and budgetary control during the year: 1 the supply of mobile telecommunications services and products: 2 the provision of mobile internet services: and 3 other businesses, comprising O Airwave, a terrestrial trunked radio business, and Manx Telecom, the fixed and mobile 2 telecommunications business in the Isle of Man.
Mobile telecommunications services mainly derives its turnover from the calls made and received by its customers using mobile telephones, from subscription fees charged to its contract customers and from handset equipment sales.
Mobile internet services generate revenue through advertising, provision of content and application and from e-commerce and m-commerce activities.

In the year ended 31 March 2004, the Group incurred an exceptional charge of 75 million in respect of the restructuring of central functions and the resultant rationalisation of the Groups property portfolio.
This arose on the transfer of O Online, Products O and certain 2 2 other central functions to the Groups operating businesses in the UK, Germany and Ireland and includes provisions relating to redundancies and the termination of property leases.
This charge gave rise to a cash outflow of 17 million in the year.
The impairment review performed by the Group during the year ended 31 March 2003 resulted in an exceptional non-cash operating charge in respect of the Groups continuing businesses of 8,300 million.
This comprised charges relating mainly to the impairment of UMTS licences and goodwill in O UK and O Germany totalling 2,300 million and 4,700 million respectively and the impairment of goodwill in 2 2 O Ireland of 1,300 million.
In 2002 the exceptional reorganisation costs related to the restructuring of the UK and German operations post 2 demerger and included 87 million in respect of redundancy costs.
They gave rise to a cash outflow of 27 million in that year.

The tax assessed for the year varied from the amount computed by applying the corporation tax rate to profit or loss on ordinary activities before taxation.
The differences were attributable to the following factors: 2004 2003 2002 m m m United Kingdom corporation tax on profit loss at standard rate 29 3,061 262 Non-deductible depreciation, amortisation and impairment 78 2,387 124 Non-deductible non-United Kingdom losses 23 44 Non-United Kingdom tax rate differences 16 7 3 Depreciation for the year in excess deficit of capital allowances 1 14 21 Losses carried forward 30 657 33 Losses brought forward and utilised 138 Non-deductible losses on sale of discontinued operations 2 Pre-demerger losses 74 Other timing differences and adjustments 28 3 Prior year adjustments 1 Current tax charge credit for year 13 10 11 mmo2.

Deferred tax assets in respect of certain other UK and German losses carried forward and other timing differences totalling 3,190 million have not been recognised due to insufficient certainty regarding the availability of appropriate future taxable profits.
No deferred tax is currently recognised on unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries.

Acquisitions and disposals On 14 April 2003, the Group announced that it had agreed the sale of its wholly owned Dutch subsidiary, O Netherlands, to Greenfield 2 Capital Partners, an independent private equity and corporate finance group with existing interests in the fixed telecoms sector, for 25 million cash.
The sale was completed on 3 June 2003 and took the form of the sale of all the issued shares of O Netherlands.
In the 2 year ended 31 March 2003, the Group recognised a non-operating exceptional provision for loss on disposal of O Netherlands of 1,364 2 million.
This represented the impairment of the assets of O Netherlands, and goodwill relating to the original purchase of the stake in O 2 2 Netherlands, down to their net recoverable amount which in this case was the sale proceeds less the estimated direct costs of disposal.
The total loss on sale arising on completion was 1,369 million which, after utilisation of the provision recognised in 2003, resulted in a nonoperating exceptional loss of 5 million in the year.
In February 2001, Telenor exercised a put option to sell its remaining 49.5 per cent interest in O Ireland to the Group and this transaction 2 was completed in April 2001, following approval by the regulator.
The total consideration for this stake was 877 million including expenses resulting in additional goodwill of 884 million.

Full details are disclosed in the supplementary information for United States investors on pages 99 to 115.
Pension costs The Group operates a number of pension schemes in its businesses.
All the Groups pension schemes are provided through either defined benefit or defined contribution arrangements.
Defined benefit schemes generally provide pensions based on the employees length of service and their final pensionable salary.
Defined contribution schemes offer employees individual funds which are converted into pension benefits on retirement.
The majority of the schemes assets are held independently of the Groups finances.
The mmO Pension Plan 2 The mmO Pension Plan mmO PP provides the pension benefits for the majority of UK employees and is divided into defined contribution 2 2 and defined benefit sections.
Defined contribution section Prior to 1 July 2002, the Group participated in the BT Retirement Plan BTRP, a defined contribution scheme established by BT.
Members of the BTRP could elect to transfer their funds under management into the new mmO Plan defined contribution section on its inception.
2 These funds were transferred on 14 March 2003.
Defined benefit section Following the Group's demerger from BT and until 30 June 2002, the Group was a participating employer in the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, a funded defined benefit pension scheme.
While participating the Group paid to the BTPS a predetermined percentage of the pensionable payroll costs of those Group employees who were members of the scheme.
These costs have been charged in the period to which they relate.
Details of the financial position of the BTPS and further information regarding the scheme are contained in the financial statements of BT Group plc.
On 1 July 2002 the mmO PP was established for employees in the United Kingdom by the Group.
Any active member of the BTPS employed 2 by the Group could join a defined benefit section of, and elect to transfer their past service liability from the BTPS to, the new plan.
The vast majority of those eligible to transfer elected to do so.
The benefits of all deferred and pensioner members at 30 June 2002 remain in the BTPS.
A share of the assets of the BTPS, determined on the basis of the past service liabilities of the members electing to transfer their benefits to the new plan, were transferred to the mmO PP on 17 March 2003.
com Notes to the financial statements From 1 July 2002, the Group has been the principal employer of the mmO PP.
The pension costs have been assessed in accordance with the 2 advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method and taking assets at market value.
The defined benefits sections of the mmO 2 PP are closed to new entrants and therefore the current service cost is likely to increase as the members approach retirement.
Actuarial valuation The first full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the mmO PP was undertaken at 30 June 2003 by a professionally qualified 2 independent actuary using the projected unit method.
The purpose of this valuation was to design a future funding plan to ensure that contributions to the plan are sufficient to meet future liabilities.
As at 30 June 2003 the assets of the mmO PP had a market value of 230 2 million and were sufficient to cover 86 per cent of the benefits accrued to members at that date on the ongoing funding measure.
As a result of the valuation, the Group has increased the employers regular contribution rate from 11.6 per cent to 13.1 per cent of pensionable salaries with effect from 1 April 2004.
In order to meet the deficit, additional annual payments of 4.4 million are payable for 13 years subject to review at future valuations.
The employees contribution rate remains at 6 per cent of pensionable salary.
The main actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows: % Nominal rate of increase in salaries 3.75-4.25 Nominal rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.50 Investment return pre retirement 7.00 Investment return post retirement 5.50 Inflation assumption 2.50 Other Group pension plans The Group operates several other defined benefit pension schemes.
In the Isle of Man benefits are provided by a funded defined benefit pension scheme that is closed to new entrants.
The Group also operates unfunded defined benefit schemes in the UK and in Germany.
A provision, determined in accordance with SSAP 24, is recorded on the balance sheet to recognise the cumulative accrued liability for the unfunded schemes.
Until May 2001 the O Germany main scheme was unfunded.
This scheme has been changed to a funded arrangement with payments 2 being made to provide for previously unfunded liabilities over the period to the active members retirements.
The vast majority of members of the O Germany main scheme are now accruing benefits under a defined contribution arrangement.
The other defined benefit schemes 2 in Germany are unfunded.
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in Germany, Ireland and the Isle of Man.
The assets of these defined contribution arrangements are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The assets and liabilities of the O Netherlands pension scheme were included in the disposal of O Netherlands to Greenfield Capital Partners.
2 2 Disclosures under SSAP 24 The total cost charged to the profit and loss account for all the Groups pension schemes was 26 million 2003: 24 million, 2002: 26 million as analysed below: 2004 2003 2002 m m m mmO Pension Plan cost 16 12 2 Contributions to the BT Pension Scheme 420 Other defined benefit schemes 3 44 Defined contribution schemes 7 42 26 24 26 Of the total cost, 24 million is regular cost 2003: 24 million, 2002: 26 million.

In addition, contributions of 1 million were paid to the BTRP in the year ended 31 March 2002.
There were no 2 contributions outstanding or pre-paid at the year end.
Pension costs continued The unfunded defined benefit arrangement in the UK has 23 members of whom 15 were active 2003: 23 members of whom 22 were active, 2002: 24 members of whom all were active.
At 31 March 2004, the mmO PP had 4,596 members of whom 4,014 were active.
The O Germany schemes had 3,008 members of whom 2 2 2,996 were active.
The Isle of Man schemes had 437 members of whom 281 were active.
The O Ireland scheme had 1,112 members of 2 whom 918 were active.
The principal assumptions used to determine the pension cost for the defined benefit section of the mmO PP for the year were: 2 2004 2003 % % Nominal rate of increase in salaries 3.75-4.25 4.25 Nominal rate of increase of pensions in payment 2.50 2.50 Investment return pre retirement 7.50 6.50 Investment return post retirement 5.70 6.00 Inflation assumption 2.50 2.50 The assumptions for the other defined benefit schemes around the Group are consistent with those used for the mmO PP.
2 At 31 March 2004, using SSAP 24, a deficit of 12 million existed in the mmO PP.
This difference between the assets and liabilities is 2 being amortised over the expected future working lives of the active membership, of 13 years, using the straight line method and is included in the cost.
