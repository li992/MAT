Changes in accounting policy and presentation and discontinued activities a Changes in accounting policy and presentation There have been no changes to accounting policies in the 2004 financial year.
A small number of changes in the presentation of the notes to the financial statements have been made and comparative gures have been restated accordingly as explained in the notes where material.
b Discontinued activities On 1 June 2001, BT disposed of its interests in Japan Telecom and J-Phone Communications and, on 29 June 2001, its interest in Airtel.
On 22 June 2001, BT sold Yell, its classied advertising directory businesses in the UK and the USA.
These activities, together with mmO which was demerged on 19 November 2001, are shown 2 as discontinued operations in the profit and loss accounts.
The eliminations are intra-group eliminations.
The interest charge allocated to mmO up to the date of the demerger has been calculated assuming that mmO s 2 2 net debt at the date of the demerger of 500 million, had been in existence for the whole of the period, and had been bearing an interest charge of 8% per annum.
The interest charge allocated to Yell up to the date of disposal represents amounts payable on intercompany loans charged at an arms length rate of interest.
The taxation charge allocated to discontinued activities, up to the date of demerger or disposal, represents amounts charged to these entities before recognising credit for group relief surrendered to entities within continuing activities.

Its main services and products are xed voice and data calls, the provision of xed exchange lines to homes and businesses, the provision of communication services to other operators, the provision of private services to businesses and the supply of telecommunication equipment for customers premises.
The turnover of each line of business is derived as follows: & BT Retail derives its turnover from the supply of exchange lines and from the calls made over these lines, the provision of ICT products and services, the leasing of private circuits and other private services, the sale and rental of customer premises equipment to the groups UK customers and other lines of business and from its narrowband and broadband internet access products.
& BT Wholesale derives its turnover from providing network services to other BT lines of business, and from interconnecting the groups UK network to other operators.
& BT Global Services mainly generates its turnover from the provision of ICT products and services, outsourcing and systems integration work and from the xed network operations of the groups European subsidiaries.
The business also derives revenues from providing web hosting facilities to end customers and through BT lines of business.
Segmented information on the lines of business is given below for the years ended 31 March 2004, 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 as required by the UK accounting standard SSAP 25 and the US accounting standard SFAS No.

In addition, the group moved management responsibility of BT Openworld to BT Retail.
Comparative gures have been restated for these and other changes and in certain instances have been determined using apportionments and allocations.

The surplus of 9,537 million arising from this capital reduction has been credited to the group profit and loss reserve.
The transfer of BTGI to the company has been accounted for as a group reconstruction in accordance with the principles of merger accounting set out in Financial Reporting Standard 6 FRS 6 and Schedule 4A to the Companies Act 1985.
The consolidated financial statements are therefore presented as if the company had been the parent company of the group throughout the year ended 31 March 2001 and up to the date of the demerger.
The results of mmO have been included in discontinued activities in all three years.
2 The transfer of BT to BTGI on 16 November 2001 was a group reorganisation effected for non-equity consideration.
This transaction has been accounted for in these financial statements using the principles of merger accounting as if BT had been owned and controlled by BTGI throughout the year ended 31 March 2001 and up to 16 November 2001.
This is not in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 since the group reorganisation does not meet all the conditions for merger accounting.
If acquisition accounting had been applied to account for the reorganisation whereby BTGI became the parent company of BT, this would have resulted in all the separable assets and liabilities of the BT Group as at 16 November 2001 being recorded at their fair values, substantial goodwill and goodwill amortisation charges arising and only the post demerger results being reected within the BT Group consolidated financial statements.
The directors consider that to have applied acquisition accounting in preparing these financial statements would have failed to give a true and fair view of the groups state of affairs and results.
This is because, in substance, BT Group is the successor to BT and its shareholders have had a continuing interest in the BT business both before and after the demerger.
The directors consider that it is not practicable to quantify the effects of this departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
In the companys financial statements, its investment in BTGI is stated at the nominal value of shares issued.
In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985, no premium was recorded on the ordinary shares issued see note 37.
On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the shares issued and the aggregate share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve of BT at the date of the demerger the merger difference, has been debited to the other reserves.
Related party transactions In the year ended 31 March 2004, the groups turnover with its associates and joint ventures amounted to 1 million 2003 3 million, 2002 15 million and the group purchased 60 million 2003 69 million, 2002 99 million in services and products from these undertakings.
Interest for the year of nil 2003 nil, 2002 1 million was receivable on debt due from these undertakings.
The amount of debt outstanding with these undertakings, at 31 March 2004, was 28 million 2003 20 million.
The maximum debt outstanding during the year was 43 million 2003 92 million.
As at the latest practicable date, 14 May 2004, the amount of debt outstanding was 28 million.
There were a number of transactions during the year between the company and its subsidiary undertakings, which are eliminated on consolidation and therefore not disclosed.

Financial commitments, contingent liabilities and subsequent events 2004 2003 m m Contracts placed for capital expenditure not provided in the accounts 879 616 Operating lease payments payable within one year of the balance sheet date were in respect of leases expiring: Within one year 8 11 Between one and five years 29 26 After five years 330 317 Total payable within one year 367 354 Future minimum operating lease payments for the group at 31 March 2004 were as follows: 2004 m Payable in the year ending 31 March: 2005 367 2006 361 2007 362 2008 367 2009 369 Thereafter 9,088 Total future minimum operating lease payments 10,914 Operating lease commitments were mainly in respect of leases of land and buildings.
At 31 March 2004, other than disclosed below there were no contingent liabilities or guarantees other than those arising in the ordinary course of the groups business and on these no material losses are anticipated.
The group has insurance cover to certain limits for major risks on property and major claims in connection with legal liabilities arising in the course of its operations.
Otherwise, the group generally carries its own risks.
The group has provided guarantees relating to certain leases entered into by O UK Limited prior to its 2 demerger with mmO on 19 November 2001, mmO plc has given BT a counterindemnity for these guarantees.
2 2 The maximum likely exposure is US$76 million 41 million as at 31 March 2004, although this could increase by a further US$582 million, 317 million in the event of credit default in respect of amounts used to defease future lease obligations.
The guarantee lasts until O UK Ltd has discharged all its obligations, which is expected 2 to be when the lease ends on 30 January 2017.
The group has guaranteed part of the bank borrowings of its joint venture Albacom SpA under the terms of the joint ventures renancing in the 2004 financial year.
This expires on the earlier of the loan being repaid or 31 October 2011.
The guarantee is triggered if Albacom fails to meet the repayment schedule under the terms of the loan and is effectively capped at e34.5 million.
The company does not believe there are any pending legal proceedings which would have a material adverse effect on the financial position or results of operations of the group.
Proceedings have been initiated in Italy against 21 defendants, including a former BT employee, in connection with the Italian UMTS auction.
Blu, in which BT held a minority interest, participated in that auction process.
The evidential hearings are continuing, in Rome.
If the proceedings are successful, BT could be held liable, with others, for any damages.
The company has concluded that it is not appropriate to make a provision in respect of any such potential claim.

Pension costs Background The group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with UK Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
In addition, disclosures have been presented in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.
The group offers retirement plans to its employees.
The groups main scheme, the BT Pension Scheme BTPS, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
The BTPS is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
This scheme has been closed to new entrants since 31 March 2001 and replaced by a dened contribution scheme.
Under this dened contribution scheme the profit and loss charge represents the contribution payable by the group based upon a xed percentage of employees pay.
The total pension costs of the group including discontinued activities expensed within staff costs in the year was 404 million 2003 322 million, 2002 382 million, of which 376 million 2003 306 million, 2002 373 million related to the groups main dened benefit pension scheme, the BTPS.
The increase in the pension cost reects the amortisation charge for the pension deficit partly offset by a reduction in the number of active members of the BTPS and the interest credit relating to the balance sheet prepayment.
This total pension cost includes the cost of providing enhanced pension benets to leavers, which amounted to 1 million 2003 60 million, 2002 46 million.
In the year ended 31 March 2002 this profit and loss charge of 46 million was not the full cash cost of 186 million because there was a pension fund accounting surplus, including the provision on the balance sheet of 140 million, that was fully utilised before making a charge to the profit and loss account.
The pension cost applicable to the groups main dened contribution schemes in the year ended 31 March 2004 was 7 million, 2003 4 million, 2002 5 million, and 0.7 million 2003 0.4 million, 2002 0.3 million of contributions to the schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2004.
The group occupies four properties owned by the scheme on which an annual rental of 3 million is payable.
The BTPS assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, UK and overseas properties, xed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
At 31 March 2004, the UK equities included 33 million 2003 37 million, 2002 55 million ordinary shares of the company with a market value of 58 million 2003 58 million, 2002 154 million.
BT Pension Scheme Funding valuation A triennial valuation is carried out for the independent scheme trustees by a professionally qualied independent actuary, using the projected unit method.
The purpose of the valuation is to design a funding plan to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The triennial valuation as at 31 December 2002 forms the basis of determining the groups pension fund contributions for the year ending 31 March 2004 and future periods until the next valuation is completed.
The funding valuation is performed at 31 December because this is the financial year end of the BTPS.
The valuation basis for funding purposes is broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the valuation date: and & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The last three triennial valuations were determined using the following long-term assumptions: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2002 1999 1996 2002 1999 1996 valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation valuation % % % % % % Return on existing assets, relative to market values 4.52 2.38 3.80 7.13 5.45 7.95 after allowing for an annual increase in dividends of 1.00 1.00 0.75 3.53 4.03 4.78 Return on future investments 4.00 4.00 4.25 6.60 7.12 8.42 Average increase in retail price index 2.50 3.00 4.00 Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.50 1.75 1.75 4.04 4.80 5.82 Average increase in pensions 2.50 3.00 3.75-4.00 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 1.25% for the first three years.
The mortality assumption reects improvements in life expectancy since the 1999 valuation and incorporates further future improvements.
109 Notes to the financial statements BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 31.
Pension costs continued The assumed rate of investment return, salary increases and mortality all have a significant effect on the funding valuation.
A 0.25 percentage point change in these assumptions would have the following effects on the funding deficit: Impact on funding deficit Increase Decrease bn bn 0.25 percentage point change in: Investment return 0.9 0.9 Wage and salary increases 0.2 0.2 An additional year of life expectancy would result in a 0.7 billion increase in the deficit.
At 31 December 2002, the assets of the BTPS had a market value of 22.8 billion 1999 29.7 billion and were sufficient to cover 91.6% 1999 96.8% of the benets accrued by that date, after allowing for expected future increases in wages and salaries but not taking into account the costs of providing incremental pension benets for employees leaving under release schemes since that date.
This represents a funding deficit of 2.1 billion compared to 1.0 billion at 31 December 1999.
The funding valuation uses conservative assumptions whereas, had the valuation been based on the actuarys view of the median estimate basis, the funding deficit would have been reduced to 0.4 billion.
Although the market value of equity investments had fallen, the investment income and contributions received by the scheme exceeded the benets paid by 0.3 billion in the year ended 31 December 2002.
As a result of the triennial funding valuation the group agreed to make employers contributions at a rate of 12.2% of pensionable pay from April 2003 and annual deficiency payments of 232 million.
This compared to the employers contribution rate of 11.6% and annual deficiency payments of 200 million that were determined under the 1999 funding valuation.
In the year ended 31 March 2004, the group made regular contributions of 284 million 2003 278 million, 2002 303 million and additional special contributions for enhanced pension benets to leavers in the year ended 31 December 2002 of 130 million in the 2004 financial year 2003 129 million, 2002 400 million and deficiency contributions of 612 million 2003 200 million, 2002 200 million which includes the early payment of 380 million scheduled for payment in subsequent years.
Under the terms of the trust deed that governs the BTPS the group is required to have a funding plan that should address the deficit over a maximum period of 20 years whilst the agreed funding plan addresses the deficit over a period of 15 years.
The group will continue to make deficiency payments until the deficit is made good.
The BTPS was closed to new entrants on 31 March 2001 and the age prole of active members will consequently increase.
Under the projected unit method, the current service cost, as a proportion of the active members pensionable salaries, is expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Despite the scheme being closed to new entrants, the projected payment prole extends over more than 60 years.
SSAP 24 accounting valuation The SSAP 24 valuation is broadly on the following basis: & scheme assets are valued at market value: and & scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit method and discounted at the estimated rate of return reecting the assets of the scheme.
The pension costs for the 2003 and 2002 financial years were based on the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000.
At 31 March 2000 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 0.2 billion and the regular cost for the 2003 and 2002 financial years was 11.6% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2000 was based on the same assumptions as the December 1999 funding valuation, with the exception that, over the long term, it has been assumed that the return on the existing assets of the scheme, relative to market values, would be a nominal 5.6% per annum which equates to a real return of 2.5% per annum.
The pension cost for the 2004 financial year was based upon the SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003.
At 31 March 2003 there was a SSAP 24 deficit of 1.4 billion, before taking account of the balance sheet prepayment and the regular cost is 11.3% of pensionable salaries.
The SSAP 24 valuation at 31 March 2003 is based on the 31 December 2002 funding valuation rolled forward, and uses the same assumptions as set out above, with the following exceptions: & return on existing assets is assumed to be a nominal 7.1% per annum, which equates to a real return of 4.7%: & average increase in retail price index is assumed to be 2.25% per annum: and & the average future increases in wages and salaries is assumed to include a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first three years, before returning to 1.5%.
110 Notes to the financial statements BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 31.
Pension costs continued The cumulative difference since the adoption of SSAP 24 between the cash contributions paid by the group to the pension scheme and the profit and loss charge is reected on the balance sheet.
The cumulative cash contributions exceed the profit and loss charge and the resulting difference is shown as a prepayment on the balance sheet.
At 31 March 2004 the prepayment was 1,172 million 2003 630 million with the increase being principally due to the additional special and deficiency contributions in the year.
The pension charge to the profit and loss account will also include the amortisation of the combined pension fund position and pension prepayment over the average remaining service lives of scheme members, which amounts to 13 years, and the cost of enhanced pension benets provided to leavers.
FRS 17 Retirement benets The group continues to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board and would apply to the group for the 2006 financial year.
However, in the 2006 financial year the group will adopt International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The requirements for disclosure under FRS 17 remain in force between its issue and adoption of IFRS, and the required information is set out below.
FRS 17 species how key assumptions should be derived and applied.
These assumptions are often different to the assumptions adopted by the pension scheme actuary and trustees in determining the funding position of pension schemes.
The accounting requirements under FRS 17 are broadly as follows: & scheme assets are valued at market value at the balance sheet date: & scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and & movement in the scheme surplus deficit is split between operating charges and nancing items in the profit and loss account and, in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, actuarial gains and losses.
The financial assumptions used to calculate the BTPS liabilities under FRS 17 at 31 March 2004 are: Real rates per annum Nominal rates per annum 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 % % % % % % Average future increases in wages and salaries 1.00 1.50 1.50 3.63 3.78 4.04 Average increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.60 2.25 2.50 Rate used to discount scheme liabilities 2.83 3.08 3.41 5.50 5.40 6.00 Ination average increase in retail price index 2.60 2.25 2.50 There is a short term reduction in the real salary growth assumption to 0.75% for the first two years 2003 three years.

Pension costs continued The long-term expected rate of return on investments does not affect the level of the deficit but does affect the level of the expected return on assets within the net finance cost charged to the profit and loss account under FRS 17.
The net pension deficit set out below under FRS 17 is as if this standard was fully applied.
The fair value of the BTPS assets, the present value of the BTPS liabilities based on the financial assumptions set out above, and the resulting deficit, together with those of unfunded pension liabilities at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 are shown below.
The fair value of the BTPS assets is not intended to be realised in the short term and may be subject to significant change before it is realised.
The present value of the liabilities is derived from long-term cash ow projections and is thus inherently uncertain.

Employee share schemes The company has a share ownership scheme used for employee share allocations profit sharing, an employee share investment plan, savings-related share option schemes for its employees and those of participating subsidiaries, further share option schemes for selected group employees and an employee stock purchase plan for employees in the United States.
It also has several share plans for executives.
Share option schemes The major share option scheme, the BT Group Employee Sharesave Scheme, is savings related and the share options are normally exercisable on completion of a three or five year Save As You Earn contract.
A similar savings related scheme exists for group employees based outside the UK.
Following the scheme of arrangement and demerger in November 2001, all options under the savings related schemes became exercisable for a period of six months.
On expiry of this period, these options lapsed to the extent to which they had not been exercised.
Shortly before the scheme of arrangement, 57 million shares were allotted to a special purpose trust to satisfy options which were likely to be exercised during that six month period.
Participants in the BT Share Option Scheme, the BT US Stock Option Plan, the BT Worldwide Share Option Scheme, and the BT Global Share Option Plan the Executive Option Plans were given the opportunity to i conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, release their options over British Telecommunications plc shares in consideration for the grant of options in their employers new holding company BT Group plc or mmO plc : or ii if their options were already exercisable, exercise their options over ordinary 2 shares irrespective of whether the scheme of arrangement was sanctioned by the Court: or iii if their options were not already exercisable, conditionally on the scheme of arrangement being sanctioned by the Court, exercise their options immediately following that time but prior to the reduction of BT Groups share capital.
To the extent that they had not already been exercised, these options lapsed on 16 November 2001, the effective date of the scheme of arrangement.
The BT Group Legacy Option Plan was operated on 17 December 2001 following the scheme of arrangement and demerger in November 2001.
Replacement unapproved options over BT Group shares were granted to all participants in the Executive Option Plans who had released their options over British Telecommunications plc shares.
The value of the replacement options was determined by averaging the combined prices of BT Group plc and mmO plc shares over the 20 dealing days following the demerger 2 on 19 November 2001.
This resulted in a factor of 1.3198 being applied to the former option over British Telecommunications plc shares in order to give the number of BT Group shares under the new option.
The option prices of the original options were also adjusted to take account of the different number of shares under option.
On the demerger of mmO, BTs share option plans ceased to operate and were replaced by similar 2 BT Group Employee Sharesave schemes and the BT Group Global Share Option Plan.
In the 2004 financial year, options over 55 million shares were granted under the BT Group Share Option Plan.
The options will be exercisable subject to continued employment and meeting corporate performance targets, on the third anniversary of the date of grant.
A second award of options over 64 million shares was also granted.
This second award will vest in three equal tranches, on each of the first three anniversaries of the date of grant, subject to continued employment.

The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year ended 31 March 2004 has been estimated on the date of grant using a binomial option pricing model.
The following weighted average assumptions were used in that model: an expected life extending one month later than the first exercise date: estimated annualised dividend yield of approximately 5% 2003 5%, 2002 5% : risk free interest rates of approximately 4% 2003 5%, 2002 6% : and expected volatility of approximately 25% 2003 40%, 2002 34%.
The weighted average fair value of the share options granted in the year ended 31 March 2004 was 42p 2003 55p, 2002 55p for options exercisable three years after the date of grant and 51p 2003 72p, 2002 55p for options exercisable five years after the date of grant.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under the BT Group Global Share Option Plan has been estimated as 41p.
The weighted average fair value of options granted under the Special Incentive Award has been estimated as 42p.
The total value of share options granted by BT in the year ended 31 March 2004 was 22 million 2003 41 million, 2002 88 million.
In accordance with UK accounting practices, no compensation expense is recognised for the fair value of options granted where the exercise price equals the market price at date of grant or options granted under approved Sharesave schemes.

b The BT Employee Sharesave schemes.
Incentive Share Plan and Retention Share Plan The BT Incentive Share Plan ISP and the BT Retention Share Plan RSP were introduced for employees of the group in 2000.
Under the plans, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Under the ISP participants are normally only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a three-year period if the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure and if the participants are still employed by the group.
If the company has exceeded the pre-determined corporate performance measure the participants may be awarded up to double the shares conditionally awarded.
The corporate performance measure is BTs total shareholder return TSR measure against those top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the Financial Times the FTSE 100 index, at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
Awards made under the ISP in 2000 and 2001 did not vest as the company did not meet the corporate performance measure.
Under the RSP the length of retention period before awards vest is exible.
Awards may vest in annual tranches.
The shares are transferred at the end of a specified period, only if the individual is still employed by the group.
During the 2004 financial year 720,472 2003 374,039 shares vested in 7 2003 11 participants in the RSP.
Executive Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Plan The BT Executive Share Plan ESP was introduced for employees of the group in 1994.
Under the ESP, company shares are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and are conditionally awarded to participants.
Participants are only entitled to these shares in full at the end of a five-year period under the ESP if, at the end of the period, the company has met the relevant pre-determined corporate performance measure.
Awards of shares were granted in each of the years from 1994 to 1999 under the ESP.
The corporate performance measure is BTs total shareholder return TSR measure against those top 100 companies listed on the London Stock Exchange, as rated by the FTSE 100 index, at the beginning of the relevant performance period.
The sixth five-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 March 2004 and on the basis of the corporate performance measure, the companys Total Shareholder Return TSR target relative to other companies in the FTSE 100, no shares vested.
The fifth five-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 March 2003 and on the basis of the corporate performance measure, no shares vested.
The fourth five-year performance cycle of the ESP ended on 31 July 2002 and on the basis of the corporate performance measure, 32.5% of the shares vested on 1 August 2002 in 65 participants and 1.0 million shares were transferred to those participants.
116 Notes to the financial statements BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 34.
Employee share schemes continued The BT Deferred Bonus Plan DBP was established in 1998 and awards are granted annually to employees of the group.
Under this plan, shares in the company are acquired by an employee share ownership trust and transferred to participants at the end of three years if he or she has continued to be employed by the group throughout that period.
On 1 August 2003, 653,899 shares 1 August 2002 657,592 were transferred to 225 participants 1 August 2002 223 at the end of the three-year deferred period.
At 31 March 2004, 30.5 million shares 2003 31.7 million shares in the company were held in trust for employee share schemes, of which no shares 2003 15.5 million shares were held for the ISP, 3.0 million shares 2003 2.9 million shares were held for the RSP, no shares 2003 2.3 million shares were held for the ESP and 6.5 million shares 2003 4.2 million shares were held for the DBP.
Dividends or dividend equivalents earned on the shares during the conditional periods are reinvested in company shares for the potential benefit of the participants.
Additional information relating to the plans is as follows: ISP RSP ESP DBP Total Year ended 31 March 2004 m m m m m Value of range of possible future transfers: nil to 5.3 11.4 16.7 Provision for the costs of the plans charged to the profit and loss account in year 7.8 6.7 14.5 Nominal value of shares held in trust 0.2 0.3 0.5 Market value of shares held in trust 5.3 11.4 16.7 ISP RSP ESP DBP Total Year ended 31 March 2003 m m m m m Value of range of possible future transfers: nil to 24.3 4.6 3.6 6.7 39.2 Provision for the costs of the plans charged credited to the profit and loss account in year 0.2 0.2 5.8 5.4 Nominal value of shares held in trust 0.8 0.1 0.1 0.2 1.2 Market value of shares held in trust 24.3 4.6 3.6 6.7 39.2 Of the total BT Group plc shares held, 21.0 million shares were held at 31 March 2004 in trust for future awards under employee share schemes.
These shares had a nominal value of 1 million and a market value of 37.2 million at 31 March 2004.
The values of possible future transfers of shares under the plans were based on the BT Group plc share price at 31 March 2004 of 177p 2003 157p.
The provisions for the costs of the ISP, RSP and ESP were based on best estimates of the companys performance over the plans conditional periods, relating to those portions of the plan conditional periods from commencement up to the financial year end.
Employee Share Investment Plan From December 2001 the BT Group Employee Share Investment Plan ESIP was in operation.
The ESIP, which has been approved by the Inland Revenue, gives UK employees an opportunity to purchase shares partnership shares monthly out of pre-tax salary up to a maximum value of 1,500 per year.
During the 2004 financial year, 6.0 million shares 2003 5.3 million shares were purchased by the Trustee of the ESIP on behalf of 13,974 2003 12,092 employees at a total cost of 11.1 million 2003 10.6 million.
The free shares element of the ESIP allows BT to provide free shares to UK employees which are held in trust for at least three years.
A phantom plan, which delivers cash awards equivalent to the value of the free shares, operates for employees outside the UK.
In 2004, 1% of pre-tax profits, amounting to 20 million, was set aside for the ESIP and the phantom plan for employees outside the UK 2003 36 million.
The allocation of this sum was subject to two performance targets, one of increasing earnings per share by 15% and the other of reducing customer dissatisfaction by 25%, with only the first target being achieved.
The ESIP replaced the BT Employee Share Ownership Scheme which operated for employee profit sharing until 2001.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan The BT Group Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP for employees in the US enables participants to purchase ADSs quarterly at a price the Base Option Price which is 85% of the market price of an ADS at the start of the offer and in the case of employees who have joined the ESPP after the start of the offer, 85% of the market price on the date of joining, whichever is higher.
Up to 15 May 2004, 69,164 new shares have been issued and 226,218 shares have been transferred to participants out of treasury under the ESPP.
As the ADS price was less than the Base Option Price of US$31.72 from July 2002 to April 2003, the ESPP was suspended in accordance with the rules of the ESPP from April 2003 until the end of the first offer in December 2003.
A second offer was launched in December 2003, with a Base Option Price of US$25.61 and will run until December 2004.

Auditors The auditors remuneration for the year ended 31 March 2004 for the group was 3,790,000 2003 2,943,000, 2002 2,702,000.
The audit fees payable to the companys auditors,  LLP, for the company and UK subsidiary undertakings statutory accounts were 2,482,000 2003 1,910,000, 2002 1,656,000.
The following fees for audit and non-audit services were paid or are payable to the companys auditors,  LLP, for the years ended 31 March 2004, 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002: 2004 2003 2002 000 000 000 Audit services Statutory audit 3,767 2,916 2,649 Regulatory audit 1,950 1,690 1,142 5,717 4,606 3,791 Further assurance services Rights issue, restructuring and demerger projects 14,161 Corporate finance advice 462 265 982 Other 82 829 1,960 544 1,094 17,103 Tax services 2,656 2,245 1,883 Other services Systems advice 3,765 2,565 Other 110 766 1,537 110 4,531 4,102 Total 9,027 12,476 26,879 Total fees paid or payable to  LLP in the UK for non audit services in the year ended 31 March 2004 were 4,545,000 2003 8,980,000, 2002 22,683,000.
In order to maintain the independence of the external auditors, the Board has determined policies as to what non audit services can be provided by the companys external auditors and the approval processes related to them.
Under those policies work of a consultancy nature will not be offered to the external auditors unless there are clear efficiencies and value added benets to the company.
Under the terms of BTs main licence the group is required to publish audited regulatory financial statements.
The fees for regulatory work principally reect the audit fees associated with those regulatory financial statements.
The fees for tax services include tax compliance and tax advisory services.
The fees for systems advice in the year ended 31 March 2003 related to advisory services provided in connection with the implementation of certain billing systems.
These services, which were provided by PwC Consulting, the consulting business of  that was sold to IBM in October 2002, commenced in 2002 and were completed in 2003.
Financial instruments and risk management The group holds or issues financial instruments mainly to finance its operations: for the temporary investment of short-term funds: and to manage the currency and interest rate risks arising from its operations and from its sources of finance.
In addition, various financial instruments for example trade debtors and trade creditors arise directly from the groups operations.
The group nances its operations primarily by a mixture of issued share capital, retained profits, deferred taxation, long-term loans and short-term loans, principally by issuing commercial paper and medium-term notes.
The group borrows in the major long-term debt markets in major currencies.
Typically, but not exclusively, the bond markets provide the most cost-effective means of long-term borrowing.
The group uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The derivatives used for this purpose are principally interest rate swaps, gilt locks, currency swaps and forward currency contracts.
The types of financial instrument used for investment of short-term funds are prescribed in group treasury policies with limits on the exposure to any one organisation.
Short-term investing in financial instruments is undertaken on behalf of the group by substantial external fund managers who are limited to dealing in debt instruments and certain dened derivative instruments and are given strict guidelines on credit, diversication and maturity proles.
118 Notes to the financial statements BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 36.
Financial instruments and risk management continued During the year ended 31 March 2004, the groups net debt reduced from 9.6 billion to 8.4 billion due to working capital inows.
During the 2004 financial year, the group restructured some of its swaps portfolio to mitigate credit risk to certain counter parties.
As a result, the group terminated 7 billion of cross-currency interest rate swaps and replaced these with new swaps which had the same economic hedging effect.
This resulted in the group paying 445 million in reducing gross debt and receiving 420 million of interest.
The interest receipt has been included in deferred income and will be amortised to the profit and loss account over the term of the underlying debt.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole is 76:24 at 31 March 2004.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the groups net debt reduced from 13.7 billion to 9.6 billion.
2.6 billion was realised from the disposal of the groups interest in Cegetel Groupe SA in the year, and the group has closed out 2.6 billion of associated xed interest rate swaps.
The groups xed:oating interest rate prole therefore remained at 88:12 at 31 March 2003.
During the year ended 31 March 2002, net debt was reduced from 27.9 billion to 13.7 billion mainly by the groups rights issue, disposal of its Yell business, its Japanese and Spanish interests, and the property sale and leaseback transaction.
The proceeds of the rights issue and sale of assets were applied mainly in reducing short-term borrowings.
The group repaid substantially all of its medium-term notes and commercial paper in that year.
As a result of the demerger of the mmO business including its European operations, the group swapped an 2 additional e7 billion into oating rate sterling debt.
This, in conjunction with the novation of 1 billion xed rate swaps to Telereal for the property transaction, enabled the group to maintain its xed:oating ratio at approximately 88:12 at 31 March 2002.
The group uses financial instruments to hedge some of its currency exposures arising from its non-UK assets, liabilities and forward purchase commitments.
The group also hedges some of its interest liabilities.
The financial instruments used comprise borrowings in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange contracts, gilt locks and interest and currency swaps.
There has been no change in the nature of the groups risk prole between 31 March 2004 and the date of these financial statements.
The notional amounts of derivatives summarised below do not necessarily represent amounts exchanged by the parties and, thus, are not necessarily a measure of the exposure of the group through its use of derivatives.
The amounts exchanged are calculated on the notional amounts and other terms of the derivatives which relate to interest and exchange rates.
a Interest rate risk management The group has entered into interest rate swap agreements with banks and other institutions to vary the amounts and periods for which interest rates on borrowings are xed.
Under interest rate swaps, the group agrees with other parties to exchange, at specified intervals, the differences between xed rate and oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed notional principal amount.
Under gilt locks, forward sales of UK government long-dated treasury stock were entered into for periods of up to one year.
This hedge effectively xed in the interest on part of the groups then future borrowings, all of which have now been taken on.
At 31 March 2004, the group had outstanding interest rate swap agreements having a total notional principal amount of 5,210 million 2003 5,170 million.
b Foreign exchange risk management Cross currency swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts have been entered into to reduce the foreign currency exposure on the groups operations and the groups net assets.
The group also enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge investments, interest expense and purchase and sale commitments denominated in foreign currencies principally US dollars and the euro.
The remaining terms of the currency swaps are up to 30 years and the terms of currency forward exchange contracts are typically less than one year.
The purpose of the groups foreign currency hedging activities is to protect the group from the risk that the eventual net inows and net outows will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates.
At 31 March 2004, the group had outstanding foreign currency swap agreements and forward exchange contracts having a total notional principal amount of 11,367 million 2003 14,545 million.
The fair values of forward foreign currency contracts at 31 March 2004 were 301 million 2003 673 million for purchases of currency and 1,223 million 2003 1,041 million for sales of currency.
These fair values have been estimated by calculating their present values using the market discount rates, appropriate to the terms of the contracts, in effect at the balance sheet dates.
At 31 March 2004, the group had deferred unrealised gains of nil 2003 2 million and losses of 5 million 2003 nil, based on dealer-quoted prices, from hedging purchase and sale commitments, and in addition had deferred realised net gains of 3 million 2003 10 million.
These are included in the profit and loss account as part of the hedged purchase or sale transaction when it is recognised, or as gains or losses when a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur.
119 Notes to the financial statements BT Annual Report and Form 20-F 2004 36.
Financial instruments and risk management continued c Concentrations of credit risk and credit exposures of financial instruments The group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk.
The group, however, is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
The group does not normally see the need to seek collateral or other security.
The long-term debt instruments issued in December 2000 and February 2001 both contained covenants that if the group credit rating was downgraded below A3 in the case of Moodys or below A minus in the case of S&P, additional interest would accrue from the next interest coupon period at the rate of 0.25 percentage points for each ratings category adjustment by each ratings agency.
In May 2001, Moodys downgraded BTs credit rating to Baa1, which increased BTs interest charge by approximately 32 million per annum.
BTs current credit rating from S&P is A minus.
Based upon the total debt of 9 billion outstanding on these instruments at 31 March 2004, BTs annual interest charge would increase by approximately 45 million if BTs credit ratings were to be downgraded by one credit rating category by both agencies below a long-term debt rating of Baa1 A minus.
If BTs credit rating with Moodys was to be upgraded by one credit rating category the annual interest charge would be reduced by approximately 23 million.
d Fair value of financial instruments The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of the groups financial instruments at 31 March 2004 and 2003.
The carrying amounts are included in the group balance sheet under the indicated headings, with the exception of derivative amounts, which are included in debtors or other creditors or as part of net debt as appropriate.
The fair values of the financial instruments are the amount at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced or liquidation sale.

The carrying amount of the other short-term deposits and investments approximated to their fair values due to the short maturity of the instruments held.
b The fair values of listed xed asset investments were estimated based on quoted market prices for those investments.
c The fair value of the groups bonds, debentures, notes and other long-term borrowings has been estimated on the basis of quoted market prices for the same or similar issues with the same maturities where they existed, and on calculations of the present value of future cash ows using the appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, where market prices of similar issues did not exist.
d The fair value of the groups outstanding foreign currency and interest rate swap agreements was estimated by calculating the present value, using appropriate discount rates in effect at the balance sheet dates, of affected future cash ows translated, where appropriate, into pounds sterling at the market rates in effect at the balance sheet dates.

Financial instruments and risk management continued Currency exposures The table below shows the currency exposures of the groups net monetary assets liabilities, in terms of those transactional exposures that give rise to net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-sterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in non-UK operations.
At 31 March, these exposures were as follows: 2004 2003 Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total Sterling US dollar Euro Other Total m m m m m m m m m m Functional currency of group operation: Sterling 43 7 151 1 1 Euro 2 24 3 6 3 Other 13 4 Total 45 7 355 4 3 1 2 The amounts shown in the table above take into account the effect of any currency swaps, forward contracts and other derivatives entered into to manage those currency exposures.
At 31 March 2004, the group also held various forward currency contracts that the group had taken out to hedge expected future foreign currency purchases and sales.

Hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised and deferred gains and losses on instruments used for hedging and those recognised in the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 are as follows: 2004 2003 Gains Losses Gains Losses m m m m Gains and losses: a recognised in the year but arising in previous years 104 106 16 27 unrecognised at the balance sheet date 306 740 1,088 878 carried forward in the year end balance sheet, pending recognition in the a profit and loss account 564 122 140 128 expected to be recognised in the following year: unrecognised at balance sheet date 9 16 1 carried forward in the year end balance sheet, pending recognition in a the profit and loss account 124 59 104 106 a Excluding gains and losses on hedges accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of a xed asset.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the group entered into two derivatives contracts as an investment in a UK listed equity, with limited net overall exposure.
At 31 March 2003, the two contracts had a net value of nil, consisting of a futures purchase contract with a fair value of 68 million and a futures sales contract with a fair value of 68 million.
These contracts were closed out in April 2003.
Unused committed lines of credit Unused committed lines of credit for short-term nancing available at 31 March 2004 totalled approximately 145 million 2003 575 million, which was in support of a commercial paper programme or other borrowings.
These lines of credit are available for up to one year.
