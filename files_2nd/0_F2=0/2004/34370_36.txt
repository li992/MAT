These former joint ventures have now been consolidated as subsidiaries by comparing the fair value of the net assets acquired at the date the Group acquired control with the consideration paid.
Goodwill recognised relates only to the difference between the fair value of the consideration and the newly acquired elements not, as required by the Companies Act 1985, on the entire amount.
This departure from the Act, which is in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings: is considered necessary to give a true and fair view.
The effect is to increase the revaluation reserve by approximately 34m with a corresponding adjustment to negative goodwill.
