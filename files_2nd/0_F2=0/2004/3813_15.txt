The principal reasons for this difference are set out below: 2004 2003 000 000 Total profit before taxation 64,645 65,161 At 30% 19,393 19,548 Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 234 640 Relief on share option gains 54 2,845 Goodwill amortised 75 919 Impairment of goodwill 11 Adjustments in respect of previous periods 616 Adjustment following agreement of certain items for earlier years 2,447 Higher tax on overseas earnings 1 Provision for loss on disposal of subsidiary 686 Provision for net loss on investment in joint venture 86 Disposal of investment 569 Accounting depreciation in excess of tax depreciation 80 284 Other timing differences 238 Profits of overseas undertakings not taxable due to brought forward loss offset 1,887 2,590 Losses of overseas undertakings not available for relief 3,122 3,350 Current tax charge 18,192 16,911 c Factors that may affect future tax charges Based on current capital investment plans, the Group expects to continue to be able to claim capital allowances in excess of depreciation in future years.
The Group has tax losses arising from the results of overseas subsidiaries of 9,875,000.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in full in respect of these losses as they may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group and they have arisen in subsidiaries that have been loss-making for some time or in subsidiaries where the length of time that the loss remains available is limited.

50 Computacenter plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 14 Investments continued Update on acquisitions Germany and Austria On 2 January 2003, the Group acquired the trade and assets of GE CompuNet in Germany and GECITS in Austria for an initial consideration of 38,134,000.
There has been no change in the circumstances that has resulted in a change to the Boards view of the value of goodwill to the Group.
Because the audited value of the net assets at completion was lower than stipulated in the purchase agreement, Computacenter anticipates receiving a repayment of 32,448,000 from GE Capital, the vendors, resulting in a net consideration for the acquisition of 4,683,000.
Elements of this repayment calculation are disputed by GE Capital and, in accordance with the purchase agreement  has been appointed, as an independent expert, to settle the matter.
The Board has reviewed the likely outcome, taking account of the proceedings to date, and is still of the view that this is properly reflected in the Groups accounts.
The assets of each of the acquired companies have been included in the Groups balance sheet at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Further consideration may be payable to the vendor, contingent on the result of the acquired businesses in 2004.
No provision has been made for further payments, based on the actual performance in 2004.
Update on contingent liability On 15 October 2003 the vendors claimed that the Group had breached a provision of the German purchase agreement concerning an adjustment relating to tax assets, and have issued a claim for 52,165,292 36,892,000, plus interest, for upfront payment for the tax assets as opposed to payment as the assets are utilised.
The Group rejects this adjustment and legal proceedings are now pending between the parties.
On the basis of legal advice received, the Board is confident that this claim is without merit and will be defended accordingly.
No provision for this claim has been made in the Groups accounts.
