EMPLOYEES continued The Group operates throughout the UK a defined benefit final salary pension scheme, the assets of which are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method in a review of the scheme as at 1st December 2001.
The actuarial assumptions are that the investment return will be 1.9% per annum above annual salary growth.
The market value of the assets of the scheme on 1st December 2001 was 75.9m.
Their actuarial value, using the new assumptions, represented 72% of the value of benefits for service to the date of the review allowing for future salary increases.
In deriving a pension cost, the shortfall in the Scheme is being spread as fixed amounts over the future working lifetime of the existing members.
For the purpose of funding the Scheme, the shortfall is spread over a shorter period as a level percentage of members salaries.
As a result of the actuarial valuation at 1st December 2001 employer contributions to the Scheme increased with effect from 1st December 2002.
Normal annual contributions increased from 3.9m per annum to 6.6m per annum.
In this regard, with effect from 1st December 2002, the Companys UK employer contribution was increased to 15.2% of pensionable salary.
The Group has also agreed to strengthen the Schemes funding by additional contributions of 2.1m per annum for 10 years, from 2003.
Furthermore, with effect from 1st December 2003 the employer contribution was increased to 18.2% of pensionable salary.
Since the end of the financial year a review of the investment strategy for the Scheme has also been completed.
In order to control risk the target asset allocation for the Scheme has been amended and now comprises 60% equities and 40% bonds and gilts.
The defined benefit final salary section of the pension scheme closed to new members on 1st July 2001 and was replaced by a defined contribution section of the Scheme for new employees.
Under the projected unit method of valuation the current service cost will increase as members approach retirement.
The total UK employer contribution in respect of both Schemes for the year ended 30th June 2004 amounted to 9.2m 2003 5.3m, while the amount charged to the profit and loss account was 8.6m 2003 8.0m.
This reduced the balance sheet accrual of 6.0m at the year ended 30th June 2003 to 5.4m at 30th June 2004.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per ordinary share is based on the profit after taxation of 260,500,000 2003 206,400,000 and the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue and ranking for dividend during the year excluding those held by the Barratt Developments Employee Benefit Trust of 233,904,273 2003 231,641,125.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of shares in issue and ranking for dividend is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential shares.
The effect of the dilutive potential shares is 2,597,644 2003 2,253,881, this gives a diluted weighted average number of shares of 236,501,917 2003 233,895,006.
