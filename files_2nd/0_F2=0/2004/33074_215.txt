Variable plans, being those with performance criteria other than a service period, are also accounted for in accordance with SFAS 123.
The actual remuneration cost charged in each period is shown on page 139.
Amounts for prior years were restated to reect compensation costs for all the employee awards granted or modied in scal years beginning after 1994.
