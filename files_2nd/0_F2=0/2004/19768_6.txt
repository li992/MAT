There is no difference between the profit on ordinary activities before tax and the retained loss for the year stated above and their historical cost equivalents except that, as set out in Note 1 5, investment properties are revalued annually and are not subject to depreciation.
As depreciation is only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation the amount attributable to this factor cannot reasonably be separately identified or quantified.
The result for the year ended 31 March 2003 has been restated to reflect the full implementation of FRS 17.
