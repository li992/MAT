The loan repayments have therefore been classified as part of the overall consideration for the acquisition of Wizard Inns.
In the financial year to 28 December 2003, Wizard Inns made a profit after tax of 1.1m.
For the period from 29 December 2003 to 13 June 2004, Wizard Inns recorded turnover of 20.1m, operating profit of 1.1m, profit before taxation of 1.0m and profit after taxation of 0.9m.
There is no difference between profit after taxation and the recognised gains and losses for that period.
Since acquisition, the cash operations of Wizard Inns have been integrated into the existing Group accounts.
As a result, it is impractical to isolate the cashflows of Wizard Inns.

The attributed fair values are provisional.
Any further adjustments will be included in next year's financial statements.
The fair value adjustment in respect of fixed assets and provisions for liabilities and charges reflects the valuation of pub land and buildings as at 14 June 2004.
In the view of the Directors there is no material difference between a valuation at 14 June 2004 and 25 July 2004, the date of acquisition.
Pub valuations which have been identified as having onerous leases have been included in provisions.
The valuation was carried out by independent chartered surveyors, DTZ Debenham Tie Leung, on an existing use basis.
No deferred tax has been recognised on the fair value adjustment as there are no agreements to sell the assets concerned.
The trade and remaining net assets of Wizard Inns Limited were transferred to another company in the Group.
