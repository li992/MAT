NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2004 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards under the historical cost convention modified by the revaluation of investment properties.
Compliance with SSAP 19 Accounting for investment properties requires a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 relating to depreciation and amortisation and an explanation of the this departure is given in g below.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements.
a Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the accounts of CLS Holdings Plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
Two group companies have different balance sheet dates to CLS Holdings Plc: WightCable Limited at 30 June and WightCable North Limited at 29 January.
Their results have been included for the year to 31 December based on interim financial statements.
b Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of purchase consideration for businesses and subsidiary undertakings acquired over the attributable net asset value at the date of acquisition.
In the past, goodwill was written off to other reserves.
In circumstances where the purchase consideration was less than the attributable net asset value at the date of acquisition, the difference was treated as a reserve arising on consolidation and was included within other reserves.
In accordance with FRS10 goodwill and intangible assets, which was adopted from the year ended 31 December 1998, previous years negative goodwill was not recapitalised in the balance sheet.
The total amount of positive goodwill previously written off and negative goodwill previously credited, still included within other reserves is 3.2 million and 15.7 million respectively 2003: 3.2 million and 15.7 million.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of the associates is written off to the profit and loss account over a period of 20 years, as this is considered to be the useful economic life of these assets.
Negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of the joint venture has been included in the carrying amount for the joint venture, and will be credited to the profit and loss when the investment in the joint venture is sold.
The carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at the end of the first full year after acquisition and in periods where there has been an indication of impairment.
c Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year or at a contracted rate where appropriate, and the accounts of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the same rates.
Differences on exchange arising from the re-translation of the opening net investment in subsidiary companies are taken to reserves.
All other exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
d Turnover Turnover comprises the total value of rents and service charge income receivable under operating leases, and property-related services provided during the year, excluding VAT and intra-Group trading.
Where there is a material rent free period and the amount is considered to be recoverable, the income is spread evenly over the period to the date of the first break.
Rents received in advance are shown as deferred income in the balance sheet.
Turnover from cable operating companies comprises amounts invoiced, excluding VAT, trade discounts and intra-Group trading.
During the year the presentation of service charge income has been changed to include it in turnover on the face of the profit and loss account, rather than credited against the related expense.
In addition the presentation of the gross profit of the cable companies has changed to show both turnover and cost of sales.
This has had no impact on either the group operating profit or retained profit for either year.
The comparatives have been re-presented accordingly.
e Income from property sales Profits or losses arising from the sale of trading and investment properties are included in the profit and loss account of the Group.
Profits or losses arising from the sale of investment properties are calculated by reference to their carrying value and recorded after operating profit as part of ordinary activities.
f Properties i Investment properties Investment properties are re-valued bi-annually.
Completed investment properties are stated at their open market value in their existing state.
Surpluses or deficits arising on revaluation are reflected in the revaluation reserve.
Revaluation deficits that exceed the total of the revaluation reserve and are deemed to be permanent are charged to the profit and loss account.
ii Acquisition and disposal of properties Acquisitions and disposals of assets are considered to have taken place where, by the end of the accounting period, there is a legally binding, unconditional and irrevocable contract.
Profit on sales of investment properties is recognised in the profit and loss account by reference to net carrying amount.
Acquisitions and disposals are considered to be part of continuing.
70 activities unless they represent a material change to the portfolio or a departure from the principal activities of the business.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2004 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Depreciation i Investment properties Freehold In accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No 19 SSAP 19 no depreciation is provided on completed freehold investment properties.
The requirement of the Companies Act 1985 is to depreciate all properties, but that requirement conflicts with the generally accepted accounting principle set out in SSAP 19.
The Directors consider that, as these properties are not held for consumption but for investment, to depreciate them would not give a true and fair view, and that it is necessary to adopt SSAP 19 in order to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is one of the many factors influencing a property valuation and if depreciation or amortisation might have been charged, it is not possible to identify or quantify this separately.
Leasehold For the reason stated above no amortisation is provided on leasehold properties with unexpired terms of more than 50 years.
Leasehold properties having unexpired terms of less than 50 years are amortised so as to write off their cost or valuation over the unexpired period of the lease.
ii Other tangible fixed assets Depreciation is provided on all fixed assets other than investment properties, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value of each asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows: Plant and machinery over 4 to 15 years h Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of timing differences arising from differences in the treatment for accounts and tax purposes of transactions or events recognised in the financial statements except that: Provision is not made in respect of property revaluation gains and losses Provision is not made for further tax which could arise if subsidiaries or associated undertakings were to be disposed of Provision is not made for any taxation which could arise if overseas companies were to remit dividends Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that suitable taxable profits are considered sufficiently certain to arise which could be set against these assets when they reverse Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse.
i Leases Finance leases are capitalised and depreciation is provided over the shorter of the length of lease and the normal depreciation policy.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.
Interest is charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating lease rentals are charged wholly to the profit and loss account as incurred.
j Financial Instruments Interest rate caps The premium paid for interest rate caps used to hedge borrowings is held within debtors on the balance sheet and amortised over the period of the cap.
Shares, warrants & options Shares, warrants and options are held on the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is determined by the quoted market price in respect of listed instruments and Directors valuation regarding non-listed instruments.
Profits are only recognised on shares once they are sold and on options when either the maturity date is reached or the exposure on the option is closed out.
Income received on options which have not yet reached maturity is held as deferred income.
Forward foreign exchange contracts Where forward foreign exchange contracts are entered into to hedge the Groups net investment in overseas operations, any gains and losses on those contracts are taken directly to reserves.
Any potential losses on forward contracts at the balance sheet date are similarly provided for, although potential profits are deferred until they crystallise.
Any premium paid is taken to the profit and loss account in the year.. 71 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2004 1 PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued k Issue costs of loans Issue costs relating to new loans are capitalised and amortised to follow the profile of the loan principal.
Un-amortised amounts at the balance sheet date are deferred against the loan liability.
l Joint ventures and Associates The Groups share of net assets and results of associated undertakings has been included in the accounts under the equity accounting method in compliance with Finacial Reporting Standard No.
Joint ventures are arrangements in which the Group has a long-term interest and shares control under a written contractual arrangement.
The Group accounts include that appropriate share of the joint ventures results and retained reserves which have been included in the accounts on a gross equity basis in accordance with FRS 9. m Pension costs The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for all eligible employees.
The pension costs charged to the profit and loss account represent the contributions payable.
n Net rental income The Groups net rental income comprises rental and service charge income less service charge expenditure, invoiced in the year.
Net assets in relation to current asset investments amounted to 10,492,000 2003: 3,963,000.
Turnover by destination is not materially different to turnover by origin.. 72 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2004 4 INTEREST PAYABLE AND SIMILAR CHARGES 2004 2003 000 000 Group On debentures 4,170 4,234 On bank loans 25,168 23,179 On finance leases 58 89 On other loans 3,199 2,884 Issue costs of loans 2,018 1,215 34,613 31,601 Less: amounts capitalised 396 176 34,217 31,777 Share of joint ventures on bank loans 1,824 1,098 5 DIRECTORS EMOLUMENTS, SHARE OPTIONS AND INTERESTS IN ORDINARY SHARES Information relating to Directors emoluments, share options and interests in ordinary shares are given in the Remuneration Report on pages 59 to 63.

The calculation of basic and diluted EPS excludes shares held as Treasury Shares by the Company.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below: 2004 2003 Weighted Weighted average no.

Such tax would only become payable if the property were sold without it being possible to claim other loss reliefs or the earnings were remitted to the UK.
No tax is expected to be paid on these in the forseeable future.
Losses of nil 2003: 0.8 million have not been recognised in the deferred tax provision as they will only be recoverable if the entities make taxable profits in the future.
Future profitability is not sufficiently certain to recognise an asset.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences reverse.
No deferred tax liability arises relating to the Company 2003: nil.

b Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities As explained on page 14 of the financial review, in order to mitigate the effect of interest rate fluctuations the Group has purchased interest rate caps or secured fixed rate borrowings in respect of virtually all of its debt.
The interest rate risk profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was: Floating Fixed rate rate financial financial Total liabilities liabilities 000 000 000 Financial liabilities Sterling 282,445 80,092 202,353 Swedish Kronor 153,569 63,474 90,095 Euro 173,250 91,425 81,825 At 31 December 2004 609,264 234,991 374,273 Financial liabilities Sterling 266,059 147,516 118,543 Swedish Kronor 136,727 63,076 73,651 Euro 137,672 73,519 64,153 At 31 December 2003 540,458 284,111 256,347 The above floating rate debt is disclosed as such as none of the Groups interest rate caps are currently being drawn upon to cap the rate payable.
Where an interest rate swap has been entered into the resulting debt is re-classified as fixed rate.
All the Groups creditors falling due within one year other than bank and other borrowings are excluded from the above tables either due to the exclusion of short-term items or because they do not meet the definition of a financial liability, such as tax balances.
Arrangement fees of 5.7 million have been offset against the balance of floating and fixed rate loans 2003: 4.8 million.

Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.
Set out below the table is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instruments.
2004 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 000 000 000 000 Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short-term borrowings 16,825 16,825 16,843 16,843 Long-term borrowings 592,439 626,929 523,615 549,482 Short-term deposits 4,904 4,904 11,867 11,867 Cash at bank and in hand 51,776 51,776 44,826 44,826 Interest bearing debtors 1,899 2,065 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile: Interest rate caps and collars 2,568 377 2,330 527 Financial instruments held for trading purposes Equity investments and other financial assets 10,595 23,034 4,058 4,235.
84 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2004 28 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued f Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities Summary of methods and assumptions Interest rate cap and forward foreign Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet currency contracts date.
Short-term deposits and borrowings The fair value of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts approximates to the carrying amount because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Equity Investments The fair value of listed equity investments is the quoted market value.
In the case of unlisted equity investments, the fair value is estimated using the British Venture Capital Association guidelines.
Long-term interest bearing debtor The fair value of this asset has been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at the prevailing interest rate.
Long-term borrowings The fair value for floating rate loans approximates to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet as payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Fixed rate loans have been discounted at gilt rates, which were provided by the banks.
g Currency exposures As explained in paragraph 1 on page 14 of the financial review, to mitigate the effect of the currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas the Group borrows in the local currencies of its main operating units.
Gains and losses arising on net investments overseas and the financial instruments used to hedge the currency exposures are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency.
Foreign exchange differences on re-translation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the Group companies and the Group.
85 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS at 31 December 2004 28 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued h Hedges As explained in the financial review in paragraph 2 on page 14 the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures : Interest rate risk using interest rate caps Currency risk using local currency borrowing, forward foreign currency contracts and swaps Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised and are effectively deferred in the balance sheet.
Book values of the cap may differ from the fair value.
Gains and losses on forward foreign exchange contracts arise due to movements in the exchange rate.
These gains and losses are taken to reserves and matched with the change in value of the foreign net asset investment.
The table below shows the extent to which the Group has off balance sheet unrecognised and on balance sheet deferred gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year.
It also shows the amounts of such gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for the year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in next years or later profit and loss account.
