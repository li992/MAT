The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out by independent actuaries as at 5 April 2001, using the projected unit method.
The actuaries reviewed the methods and assumptions underlying the actuarial valuation of the Scheme and, as in previous years, a valuation basis linked to market value was used to value investments.
The principal assumptions used at 5 April 2001 were as follows: Valuation discount rate pre-retirement 6.6% post-retirement 5.6% Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% Pension increases 2.4% At the valuation date, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 527.3m and the actuarial value of the assets was 117% of the value of accrued benets after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The surplus of assets over past service liabilities is being used to suspend contributions until the results of the next triennial actuarial valuation are known, subject to the continuing consent of the Trustee.
The next triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme will be as at 5 April 2004.
An amount of 15.8m 2003: 6.3m in respect of the UK dened benefit scheme is included in debtors falling due after more than one year.
This includes a 10.0m contribution 2003: 5.0m to the UK dened benefit scheme made by the Group during the year.
The Group has also made provision for unfunded pensions for those Executive Directors whose benets under the funded Scheme are restricted by the Inland Revenue earnings cap.
The pension cost for the year has been assessed as 0.2m 2003: 0.2m and the balance sheet liability at 30 April 2004 as 3.5m 2003: 3.1m.
In France the Group operates a dened benefit scheme which is fully funded through a segregated fund.
The disclosures required under the transitional arrangements within FRS 17 Retirement Benets have been calculated by qualied independent actuaries based on the most recent full actuarial valuation at 5 April 2001, updated to 30 April 2004.
The financial assumptions used were: 2004 2003 2002 % per annum % per annum % per annum Rate of increase in salaries 4.2% 4.0% 4.1% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.9% 2.5% 2.6% Ination 2.9% 2.5% 2.6% Discount rate 5.7% 5.4% 5.9% The assets in the scheme and the expected long-term rates of return were: 2004 2003 2002 Expected rates Expected rates Expected rates of return Market value of return Market value of return Market value %m %m % m Equities 7.9% 342.5 7.2% 294.5 7.6% 348.9 Bonds, Gilts and Cash Weighted average 4.7% 147.0 4.4% 132.4 5.2% 154.1 Total market value of assets 489.5 426.9 503.0 The following amounts were measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17: 2004 2003 m m Total market value of assets 489.5 426.9 Present value of scheme liabilities 567.6 560.9 deficit in the scheme 78.1 134.0 Related deferred tax asset 23.5 40.2 Net pension liability 54.6 93.8 The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescales covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
The schemes assets are not intended to be realised in the short term and their fair value may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present value of the schemes liabilities is derived from cashow projections over long time periods and thus is inherently uncertain.
