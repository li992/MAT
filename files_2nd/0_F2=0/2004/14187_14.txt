6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 36 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP.
The particular accounting policies adopted by the Directors, are described below.
The accounting policies, applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year, are described below.
Certain balances reported in 2003 have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation including restricted cash from cash at bank and in hand to restricted cash and the inclusion of equity method investments.
a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 December each year.
c Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Groups share of net separable assets.
Where the cost of the acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to such net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill and capitalised in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
The profit or loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business not previously charged through the profit and loss account.
The results and cash flows relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash flow statement from the date of acquisition up to the date of disposal.
d Intangible assets goodwill For the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, purchased goodwill is capitalised in the year in which it arises and amortised over its estimated useful economic life up to a maximum of 20 years.
The Directors regard 20 years as a reasonable maximum for the estimated useful economic life of goodwill since it is difficult to make projections exceeding this period.
Provision is made for any impairment.
The asset is deemed to be impaired to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
The impairment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Goodwill is denominated in the currency in which the acquisition is made.
Capitalised purchased goodwill in respect of subsidiaries is included within intangible assets.
Capitalised purchased goodwill relating to associates is included within the carrying value of the associate.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of a business, prior to the implementation of FRS 10, which was written-off to the profit and loss reserve as a matter of accounting policy, remains eliminated in that reserve and will be charged or credited in the profit and loss account as appropriate on the subsequent disposal of the business to which it relates.
e Intangible assets intellectual property Intellectual property, including trademarks, for products with an immediate defined revenue stream and acquired for valuable consideration, is capitalised and amortised in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful life of the product generally not exceeding 20 years.
Where a product exceeds 20 years the Group believes that the product is well-established in its market.
The Company anticipates these products to be sold for the forseeable future because of the market positioning of the product and the likelihood of a competitor entering the relevant market.
Intellectual property acquired for valuable consideration but with no defined revenue stream is written-off on acquisition.
f Tangible assets Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
All other tangible fixed assets are shown at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates calculated to write-off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life at the following annual rates: Freehold buildings 2-5% per annum Office furniture and fittings 10-25% per annum Equipment and other 10-25% per annum 36 6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 37 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies continued g Investments Except as stated below, investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less provision for any impairment.
In the consolidated accounts, shares in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of pre-tax profits and attributable taxation.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the investment in joint ventures is shown as the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
h Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition is based on purchase costs calculated on a first-in, first-out basis, including transport.
Net realisable value is based on estimated normal selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
i Deferred taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The deferred tax balances are not discounted.
j Turnover The Group recognises turnover when: there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement: delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered: the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable: and collectibility is reasonably assured.
Revenues are stated net of VAT and similar taxes, trade discounts and intra-Group transactions.
The principal components of the Groups turnover and their respective accounting treatments are set out below: Revenue from the sales of products is recognised upon shipment to customers or at the time of delivery depending on the terms of sale.
Provisions for certain rebates, product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as reductions to net turnover in the same period as the related sales are recorded: Licensing and development fees represent revenues derived from licence agreements and from collaborative research and development arrangements: 37 6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 38 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies continued Initial licence fees are not considered to be separable from the associated research and development activities, even where such fees are non-refundable and not creditable against research and development services to be rendered.
Initial licence fees are deferred and recognised over the period of the licence term or the period of the associated research and development agreement.
In circumstances where initial licence fees are not for a defined period, revenues are deferred and recognised over the period to the expiration of the relevant patent to which the licence relates: During the term of certain research and development agreements, the Group receives non-refundable milestones as certain technical targets are achieved.
Revenue is recognised on achievement of milestones: and The Group also receives non-refundable clinical milestones when certain targets are achieved during the clinical phases of development, such as the submission of clinical data to a regulatory authority.
These clinical milestones are recognised when receivable.
If milestone payments are creditable against future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated to be paid.
No revenue is recognised for consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on future events, future performance, or refund obligations.
k Research and development Research and development expenditure includes funded and unfunded expenditure and is written-off in the period in which it is incurred.
l Pensions The Group contributes to personal defined contribution pension plans of employees.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account as they become payable.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
m Foreign currency Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date.
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets and on foreign currency borrowings, to the extent that they hedge the Groups investments in such operations, are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
All other exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
n Leases Assets acquired under finance leases are capitalised at their fair value on the inception of the leases and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease and the useful economic lives of the assets.
The finance charges are allocated over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding and are charged to the profit and loss account.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the lease term.
o Finance costs Finance costs of debt are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
p Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the period.
Convertible debt is treated as a liability as long as there is no genuine commercial possibility that the option to issue ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares will be exercised.
q Government grants Government grants in respect of funded research and development expenditure are credited to the profit and loss account as the related expenditure is incurred.
38 6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 39 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 1 Accounting policies continued r Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange risk and interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For a forward foreign exchange contract to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual foreign currency assets or liabilities or to a probable commitment.
It must involve the same currency or similar currencies as the hedged item and must also reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
Gains and losses arising on these contracts are deferred and recognised in the profit and loss account, or as adjustments to the carrying amount of fixed assets, only when the hedged transaction has itself been reflected in the Groups accounts.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
s Associates In the Group financial statements investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of associates profits less losses while the Groups share of the net assets of the associates is shown in the consolidated balance sheet.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
Any unamortised goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investments in associates.
t Employee share schemes In accordance with UITF Abstract 17 Employee share schemes, the cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares is recognised as a charge in the profit and loss account.
The amount recognised, which is the difference between the market value at date of grant of the underlying share and any exercise price, is charged to the profit and loss account over the period the shares are vested, with a corresponding credit to reserves.
u Related party transactions In accordance with the exemptions in FRS 8 related party disclosures, transactions between Group companies have not been disclosed since Group accounts are prepared and include the results of all subsidiary undertakings.
v Significant accounting estimates Sales deductions primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid and other Government agencies, contractual rebates with health-maintenance organisations HMOs, product returns, trade discounts and allowances for the coupon sampling programme.
Statutory rebates to state Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with HMOs are based on price differentials between a base price and the selling price.
As a result, the rebates increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product.
Provision for rebates are recorded as reductions to turnover in the same period as the related sales with estimates of future utilisation derived from historical trends.

These costs were being amortised through the profit and loss account over the life of the loan notes.
These costs have been partly offset by a reduction in interest payable for the period from redemption of the loan notes up to 31 December 2004.
Interest payable and similar charges includes net exchange gains on foreign currency borrowings less deposits of 1.1 million 2003: 3.9 million.

The US statutory federal tax rate is higher than that of the UK with profits being taxed at 35%.
Other jurisdictions have lower effective tax rates.
In the future, changes in US tax law may affect the Group tax charge.
No tax deduction is available on the impairment of goodwill that was created on the acquisition of BioChem Pharma Inc. As of 31 December 2004 the Company has not made a UK tax provision on approximately 729.2 million of unremitted earnings of its international subsidiaries.
The Company does not provide for income taxes on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries located outside the UK, where such earnings have been retained indefinitely for reinvestment, or where it is managements intention that the earnings will be remitted in a tax free liquidation, or as dividends with taxes substantially offset by foreign tax credits.
It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognised deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences related to these investments.
8 Loss attributable to Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc The loss for the financial year dealt with in the accounts of the Company was 17,492,000 2003: profit of 194,246,000.
As provided by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented in respect of the Company.

Diluted EPS is based on the net profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year and adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that were outstanding during the year.
Share options to purchase approximately 16.6 million ordinary shares for the year to 31 December 2004 were not dilutive and were therefore excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share 2003: 17.0 million.
Warrants to purchase approximately 1.3 million ordinary shares for the year to 31 December 2003 were not dilutive and were therefore excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share.
The $370 million convertible loan note is excluded from the calculation of weighted average number of shares for fully diluted loss per share for the year to 31 December 2004 and 2003 as it was not dilutive.

The amount of the reserve represents the deduction in arriving at shareholders funds for the consideration paid for the Companys shares purchased by the trust which had not vested unconditionally to employees at the balance sheet date.
The Deferred Bonus Plan the Plan provides for participants to use up to 50% of their annual bonus to buy shares in the Company.
The Company will match any shares bought, but the matched shares will vest, for executive Directors, only if the Companys EPS grows by more than 15% in excess of RPI over a three-year period 9% in excess of RPI for other eligible employees.
Recent fiscal changes in the US have made the Plan less attractive to participants and the Remuneration Committee has determined that it will discontinue the Plan after bonus awards for the 2004 financial year.

In April 2004 Shire announced that it had contributed cash, equipment and intellectual property to the start-up of a new Canadian-based pharmaceutical research and development organisation, ViroChem Pharma Inc. in return for a 14% equity interest.
The transaction followed the closure of the Lead Optimisation business in August 2003 and the decision to exit the vaccines business.
In addition, Shire contributed 2.8 million to various partnerships during the year ended 31 December 2004.
Distributions from these partnerships totalled 0.7 million 2003: nil.
During the year to 31 December 2004, the Company recorded an impairment of 8.6 million due to a decrease in the market value of its investment in private companies.
In addition, the Company recorded an impairment of 2.2 million 2003: 5.7 million against the investment in the GeneChem Funds following reviews of the Funds investment portfolios that identified permanent declines in the value of certain private and publicly quoted securities held by the Funds.
At 31 December 2003, Shire held an investment in a private company that was entering the later stages of an Initial Public Offering IPO.
At 31 December 2003 the anticipated flotation price was used to value the investment.
In March 2004, this private company gained its listing, but the initial listing price was below the anticipated flotation price used at 31 December 2003.
The Company recorded an impairment of 2.3 million included in the 8.6 million above to decrease the value of the investment to the initial IPO price, because it believed the decline in price was permanent.
The total value of the Groups investments in private companies that underwent an IPO during the year to 31 December 2004 was 5.4 million 2003: nil.

During the year ended 31 December 2004, the Group received 31.3 million $60.0 million in the form of subscription receipts upon the completion of the disposal of its vaccines business to ID Biomedical Corporation IDB, a Canadian biotechnology company.
See Note 16 for further information.
During the year to 31 December 2004, the Company sold an investment and realised a gain on the sale of 8.3 million 2003: nil.
The Company recorded an impairment of 0.9 million 2003: $nil to its investment in a public company.
The company concerned announced the resignation of a key member of senior management and Shire believes that the decline in the investee companys share price following the announcement indicates long-term impairment.
16 Acquisitions and disposals a Acquisitions The Group made no acquisitions during the year ended 31 December 2004. b Disposals Vaccines business On 9 September 2004 the Company completed its disposal of the vaccines business to ID Biomedical Corporation IDB, a Canadian biotechnology company.
The total consideration for the sale was $120 million 65.1 million comprising $30 million 15.6 million of cash received at completion, $30 million 15.6 million of cash held in escrow and due on the first anniversary of closing and $60 million 31.3 million received at completion in the form of 4,931,864 subscription receipts of IDB.
Each subscription receipt entitles Shire to acquire, at any time during the period from 10 January 2005 to 9 July 2006, for no additional consideration, one fully paid common share of IDB.
Prior to 10 January 2005, if IDB were to raise up to $60 million from equity related issuances then they were required to repurchase the subscription receipts from Shire for $60 million in cash.
On 21 December 2004, IDB gave notification that it intended to complete a convertible debt issuance on 7 January 2005 and subsequently repurchased the subscription receipts from Shire on 7 January 2005.
In addition to the $120 million consideration, IDB is required to reimburse Shire in full for the net cost of operating the vaccines business from 30 June 2004.
As part of the transaction, Shire entered into an agreement to provide IDB with a loan facility of up to $100 million 52.1 million, which can be drawn down over the four years following completion.
It is expected that IDB will draw down the entire $100 million loan.
This facility can be used by IDB to fund the development of injectable flu and pipeline products within the vaccines business acquired from Shire.
Drawings under the loan facility will be segregated into two components: drawings for injectable flu development with a minimum drawing of $30 million 15.6 million.
Such drawings under the loan facility will be repayable out of income generated by IDB on future non-Canadian injectable flu products, subject to minimum annual repayments in respect of the $30 million minimum drawing, to be made between 2007 and 2017: and drawings for pipeline development of up to $70 million 36.5 million.
Such drawings under the loan facility will be repayable out of income generated by IDB on future pipeline products developed using these drawings and will have no fixed repayment schedule.
The combined drawings of the two components of the loan facility cannot exceed $100 million.
As at 31 December 2004, IDB had drawn down $56.8million 29.6 million, $30.0 million 15.6 million for injectable flu development and $26.8 million 14.0 million for pipeline development.
The transaction gave rise to an overall loss on sale of the vaccines business of 23.2 million, which was recognised in the second quarter of 2004.
This comprises a profit on disposal of net assets of 13.3 million together with a provision for a loss of $70 million 36.5 million out of the $100 million 52.1 million loan facility available to IDB.
This provision is made on the basis that loan repayments based only on the future sales of pipeline products in development provide no certainty of recovery.

Only BioChem shareholders with Canadian residency had the option to receive exchangeable shares for their shares of BioChem at the time of acquisition.
The exchangeable shares were issued by Shire Acquisition Inc. a company incorporated under the Canada Business Corporations Act, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Holders of exchangeable shares are entitled to vote at shareholder meetings of the Company and are entitled to a dividend and other rights that are economically equivalent to those of ordinary shares, through a voting trust and by means of the special ordinary voting shares in Shire.
As at 31 December 2004 4,226,476 exchangeable shares remained unconverted.
The Company can redeem all outstanding exchangeable shares for ordinary shares after 11 May 2011, or earlier if the total number of exchangeable shares falls below 1 million.
The exchangeable shares are included as part of share capital in the consolidated balance sheet to present a true and fair view of the consolidated Groups capital structure, which differs from the Companies Act 1985 requirements to reflect these amounts as minority interests, as they will become, and are equivalent, to ordinary shares.
Share warrants On 24 April 2002 the Company issued 741,812 share warrants, at 4.88 per warrant, and on 21 November 2002 the Company issued a further 604,595 share warrants, at 4.895 per warrant, both issues being made to Technology Partnership Canada TPC, pursuant to an agreement between BioChem and the Government of Canada GOC.

62 6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 63 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 25 Called-up share capital continued Notes i Options granted under the Executive Scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full unless the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If the Companys share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three years, they are thereafter tested quarterly by reference to share price growth over the extended period.
If the share price does not meet these conditions at any time, none of the options will become exercisable.
ii Options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme vest six weeks prior to the expiry date.
Options granted under this scheme are subject to performance criteria.
In respect of any option granted prior to August 2002, if Shires share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, the option will be exercisable in full.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three-year measurement period, the option may be exercised on 60% of the shares covered by the option.
If these conditions are not met after the initial three-year measurement period, they will thereafter be tested quarterly by reference to compound annual share price growth over an extended period.
The performance criteria were reviewed in 2002 to ensure the criteria reflected the market in which Shire operates.
Given Shires development it was considered appropriate that an EPS based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore, the performance criteria was amended so that an option would only become exercisable in full if Shires EPS growth over a three year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Price Index RPI on average a year for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% Directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% The new EPS performance criteria apply to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with some of its institutional shareholders, the Company has decided that for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the performance condition should be retested once only, at five years after the grant.
The retest will be applied only where Shires EPS growth has fallen short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant.
Hence the level of EPS growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
The EPS used will be the fully diluted EPS calculated under US GAAP reporting.
iii These options have been granted over shares in Shire Laboratories Inc. SLI, formerly Pharmavene Inc. a US company acquired by the Group on 23 March 1997.
Exercise of these options results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in the Company.
As a result of the acquisition of SLI, and in accordance with the terms of the original SLI Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to performance criteria.
iv These options have been granted over shares in Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, a US company acquired by the Group on 23 December 1999.
As a result of the acquisition of Roberts, and in accordance with the terms of the original Roberts Plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise and were not subject to any performance criteria.
v Following the acquisition of BioChem on 11 May 2001, the BioChem Plan was amended such that options over BioChems common stock became options over ordinary shares of the Company.
All BioChem options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition and were not subject to any performance conditions.
vi Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% of the mid-market price on the day before invitations are issued to employees.
Employees may enter into three or five-year savings contracts.
The exercise of options under this Scheme is not subject to any performance criteria.
vii Under the Stock Purchase Plan options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on the enrolment date the first day of the offering period or the exercise date the last day of the offering period, whichever is the lower.
The offering period is for 27 months.
The exercise of options under this plan is not subject to any performance condition.

Although there can be no assurance regarding the outcome of any of the legal proceedings referred to below, Shire believes that they will not have a materially adverse effect on the Groups financial position.
i Phentermine Shire US Inc. SUS, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Shire, is a defendant in 260 lawsuits still pending in both US federal and state courts which seek damages for, among other things, personal injury arising from phentermine products supplied for the treatment of obesity by SUS and several other pharmaceutical companies.
SUS, formerly known as Shire Richwood Inc. has been sued as a manufacturer and distributor of phentermine, an anorectic used in the short-term treatment of obesity and one of the products addressed by the lawsuits.
The suits relate to phentermine either alone or together with fenfluramine or dexenfluramine.
The lawsuits generally allege the following claims: the defendants marketed phentermine and other products for the treatment of obesity and misled users about the products and dangers associated with them: the defendants failed adequately to test phentermine individually and when taken in combination with the other drugs: and the defendants knew or should have known about the negative effects of the drugs and should have informed the public about such risks and or failed to provide appropriate warning labels.
SUS has been named as a defendant in a total of 4,196 such phentermine lawsuits, in respect of which SUS has been dismissed as a defendant in 3,936 cases.
Eight of the 4,196 cases name Shire as a defendant, but have not been served as required by state and federal rules of civil procedure.
It is expected that Shire will be dismissed from the remaining cases based upon lack of product identification or agreement of the parties.
SUS became involved with phentermine through its acquisition of certain assets of Rexar Pharmacal Corporation Rexar in January 1994.
In addition to SUS potentially incurring liability as a result of its own production of Oby-Cap, a phentermine product, the plaintiffs may additionally seek to impose liability on SUS as successor to Rexar.
SUS intends to defend vigorously all the lawsuits.
SUS denies liability on a number of grounds including lack of scientific evidence that phentermine, properly prescribed, causes the alleged side effects and that SUS did not promote phentermine for long-term combined use as part of the fen phen diet.
Accordingly, SUS intends to defend vigorously any and all claims made against the Group in respect of phentermine.
Legal expenses to date have been paid by Eon Labs, Inc. Eon, the supplier to SUS, or Eons insurance carriers but such insurance is now exhausted.
Eon has agreed to defend and indemnify SUS in this litigation pursuant to an agreement dated 30 November 2000 between Eon and SUS.
ii ADDERALL XR a Barr Laboratories, Inc. Shires extended release once-daily version of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, is covered by US patent No.
In January 2003 the Company was notified that Barr Laboratories, Inc. Barr had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic versions of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg and 30mg strengths of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the Companys 819 Patent.
The notification alleged that the 819 Patent is not infringed by Barrs extended release mixed amphetamine salt product, which is the subject of Barrs ANDA.
On 24 February 2003 Shire Laboratories Inc. Shire Laboratories filed suit against Barr in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Barrs ANDA infringes the 819 Patent.
The Company is seeking a ruling that Barrs ANDA infringes the 819 Patent and should not be approved before the expiration date of the 819 Patent.
The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Barr from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 819 Patent, damages in the event that Barr should engage in such commercialisation, as well its attorneys fees and costs.
Barr has counterclaimed for a declaration that its ANDA product will not infringe the claims of the 819 Patent.
Barr is also seeking its attorneys fees, costs and expenses.
On 12 August 2003, Shire Laboratories was issued a new US patent No.
6,605,300 the 300 Patent covering ADDERALL XR.
In August 2003 Shire was notified that Barr had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg and 30mg strengths of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the 300 Patent and alleging that the 300 Patent is invalid.
In September 2003 Shire Laboratories filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against Barr alleging that Barrs ANDA infringes the 300 Patent.
The Company is seeking a ruling that Barrs ANDA infringes the 300 Patent and should not be approved before the expiration date of the 300 Patent.
The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Barr from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 300 Patent, damages in the event that Barr should engage in such commercialisation, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.
By way of a counterclaim, Barr is seeking a declaration that the 300 Patent is invalid and Barr has also asked for its attorneys fees, costs and expenses.
The lawsuits against Barr with respect to the 819 and 300 Patents were consolidated in December 2003 and a trial date scheduled for January 2006.
On 27 September 2004, Barr filed an amended Answer, Affirmative Defense and Counterclaim in which Barr added the following counterclaims and affirmative defences: invalidity of the 819 patent, non-infringement of the 300 Patent and unenforceability of the 819 and 300 Patents due to inequitable conduct.
Shire has asserted affirmative defenses, alleging, among other things, that Barr has waived its right to assert the counterclaims set forth in its 27 September 2004 amended answers.
66 6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 67 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 28 Guarantees, commitments and contingencies continued Barr may not launch a generic version of ADDERALL XR before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the US Food and Drug Administration FDA.
The lawsuits triggered stays of FDA approval of up to 30 months from the Companys receipt of Barrs notices to allow the court to resolve the suits.
Even if Barr receives a tentative approval from the FDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the latest stay February 2006 or a district court decision in its favour.
In the event that Barr receives a favourable decision before the expiration of the stay, then Barr could be in a position to market its extended release mixed amphetamine salt product, upon FDA final approval of its ANDA, following the expiry of the Hatch-Waxman exclusivity period.
HatchWaxman exclusivity was originally due to expire in October 2004.
However, on 28 October 2004 the FDA granted an additional six months exclusivity to ADDERALL XR based upon pediatric studies carried out on the drug product, meaning that Barr may not market its ANDA products until after Hatch-Waxman exclusivity expires on 11 April 2005. b Impax Laboratories, Inc.
In November 2003, Shire was notified that Impax Laboratories, Inc. Impax had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of the 30mg strength of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration dates of the 819 and 300 Patents and alleging that the 819 and 300 Patents are not infringed by Impaxs extended release mixed amphetamine salt product, the subject of Impaxs ANDA.
In December 2003, Shire Laboratories filed suit against Impax for infringement of the 819 and 300 Patents.
The Company is seeking a ruling that Impaxs ANDA infringes the 819 and 300 Patents and should not be approved before the expiration dates of the 819 and 300 Patents.
The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Impax from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 819 and 300 Patents, damages in the event that Impax should engage in such commercialisation, as well its attorneys fees and costs.
Impaxs affirmative defenses include non-infringement and invalidity of both the 819 and 300 Patents.
Impax is also requesting that costs be assessed against the Company.
A trial date of 11 October 2005 has been set.
In December 2004, Shire received an additional notification from Impax advising of the filing of an ANDA for a generic version of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 25mg strengths of ADDERALL XR in addition to the 30mg strength, the subject of Impaxs initial ANDA.
In January 2005, Shire Laboratories filed suit against Impax for infringement of the 819 and 300 Patents.
The Company is seeking a ruling that Impaxs amended ANDA infringes the 819 and 300 Patents and should not be approved before the expiration dates of the 819 and 300 Patents.
The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Impax from commercialising its amended ANDA products before the expiration of the 819 and 300 Patents, damages in the event that Impax should engage in such commercialisation, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.
Impaxs affirmative defenses include non-infringement, invalidity and unenforceability of both the 819 and 300 Patents.
Impax may not launch a generic version of ADDERALL XR before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the FDA.
The lawsuits triggered stays of FDA approval of up to 30 months from the Companys receipt of Impaxs notices to allow the court to resolve the suits.
Even if Impax receives a tentative approval from the FDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the stays May 2006 in the case of the 30mg strength and June 2007 in the case of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 25mg strengths or a district court decision in its favour.
In the event that Impax receives a favourable decision before the expiration of the stays, then Impax could be in a position to market its extended release mixed amphetamine salt products upon FDA final approval of its ANDA following the expiry of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and upon the expiration of the first to files exclusivity rights.
The FDA may grant 180 days of market exclusivity to the first to file.
Hatch-Waxman exclusivity was originally due to expire in October 2004.
However, on 28 October 2004 the FDA granted an additional six months exclusivity to ADDERALL XR based upon pediatric studies carried out on the drug product, meaning that Impax may not market its ANDA products until after Hatch-Waxman exclusivity expires on 11 April 2005. c Colony Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
In December 2004, Shire was notified that Colony Pharmaceuticals Inc Colony had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic versions of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg and 30mg strengths of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the Companys 819 and 300 Patents.
Shire has decided not to sue Colony.
In any event, Colony may not market its ANDA products until FDA final approval of its ANDA following the expiry of Shires existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity on 11 April 2005 and upon the expiration of the first to files exclusivity rights.
In February 2005, Shire was notified that Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. Teva had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic versions of the 10mg and 30mg strengths of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the Companys 819 and 300 Patents.
Shire is reviewing the content of the notice received from Teva and is considering what action, if any, it will take against Teva.
In any event, Teva may not market its ANDA products until FDA final approval of its ANDA following the expiry of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity on 11 April 2005 and upon the expiration of the first to files exclusivity rights.
67 6169 UK GAAP 2004. qxd 7 12 05 1:57 PM Page 68 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 28 Guarantees, commitments and contingencies continued iv CARBATROL In August 2003 the Company was notified that Nostrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Nostrum had submitted an ANDA under the HatchWaxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of the 300mg strength of CARBATROL prior to the expiration date of the Companys US patents for CARBATROL, US patent No.
5,912,013 the 013 Patent and US patent No.
The notification alleges that the 013 and 570 Patents are not infringed by Nostrums 300mg extended release carbamazepine product, the subject of Nostrums ANDA.
This dosage strength represents about half of Shires current sales in epilepsy.
On 18 September 2003 Shire Laboratories filed suit against Nostrum in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of these two patents.
The Company was seeking a ruling that Nostrums ANDA infringes the 013 and 570 Patents and should not be approved before the expiration date of the 013 and 570 Patents.
The Company was also seeking an injunction to prevent Nostrum from commercialising its ANDA product before the expiration of the 013 and 570 Patents, damages in the event that Nostrum should engage in such commercialisation, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.
On 23 January 2004 the Company amended the complaint to delete the allegations with respect to the 013 Patent.
By way of counterclaims Nostrum is seeking a declaration that the 570 and 013 Patents are not infringed by Nostrums ANDA product as well as actual and punitive damages for alleged abuse of process by Shire.
On 12 July 2004 the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed Nostrums abuse of process counterclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
On 10 December 2004 Nostrum filed a summary judgment motion seeking a declaration of non-infringement of the 570 Patent.
Shires opposition to this motion was filed on 14 January 2005.
The case is now in the expert discovery phase.
No trial date has been set.
Nostrum may not launch a generic version of CARBATROL before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the FDA.
The lawsuit triggered a stay of FDA approval of up to 30 months from Shires receipt of Nostrums notice to allow the court to resolve the suit.
Even if Nostrum receives tentative approval from the FDA for its ANDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the stay February 2006 or a district court decision in its favour.
In the event that the Company does not prevail, then Nostrum could be in a position to market its 300mg extended release carbamazepine product upon FDA final approval of its ANDA.
29 Pension arrangements The Group has a number of defined contribution retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees.
The Company contribution is fixed as a set percentage of employees base salary.
The pension cost charge for the defined contribution schemes for the year was 4,914,000 2003: 9,824,000.
The closing creditor in respect of pension premiums at 31 December 2004 is 118,000 31 December 2003: 605,000.
The defined benefit plan operated by the Group was a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan SERP for certain US employees of the acquired company, Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation, who met certain age and service requirements.
The plan was discontinued in 2000 and there were no contributions payable in respect of the years 2004 and 2003.
The Group paid a lump sum of 9.4 million $18.0 million into the SERP, which was accounted for as a fair value adjustment on the acquisition of Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation to make good the deficit on this scheme at the time of acquisition.

In April 2004 Shire BioChem Inc. BioChem, a subsidiary of Shire, sold a Canadian property to NeuroChem Inc. for CAN$10.5 million.
Dr Bellini, a non-executive Director of Biochem and, until 10 May 2003, a non-executive Director of Shire and Mr Nordmann, a nonexecutive Director of Shire are both directors of NeuroChem Inc. Dr Bellini had an indirect substantial interest in the issued share capital of NeuroChem Inc. at the time of the transaction.
In April 2004, Biochem contributed cash of CAN$5.0 million, equipment and intellectual property to the start-up of a new Canadianbased pharmaceutical research and development organisation, ViroChem Pharma Inc. in return for an equity interest and royalties on the sale of certain products subsequently launched by Virochem.
Biochem has undertaken to invest an additional CAN$10.0 million in Virochem in two equal tranches of CAN$5.0 million in April 2005 and April 2006.
Dr Bellini, a non-executive Director of Biochem and, until 10 May 2003, a non-executive Director of Shire, had, at the time of the transaction, an indirect substantial interest in a company which is a co-investor in ViroChem Pharma Inc.
In accordance with Financial Reporting Standard No.

32 Subsequent events a NRP 104 In January 2005, Shire entered into an agreement with New River Pharmaceuticals Inc. to collaborate in developing, manufacturing, marketing and selling NRP104 in the US.
In the rest of the world, Shire acquired the license to develop and commercialise NRP104.
Shire paid an initial sum of $50 million 26.0 million on signing, and there is a further $50 million due upon acceptance of filing of the New Drug Application by the FDA and up to $300 million 156.3 million in milestone payments following the first commercial sale depending on the characteristics of the FDA approved product labelling.
A $5 million 2.6 million milestone payment is payable following the first commercial sale in specified European countries.
An additional $100 million 52.1 million milestone would be payable as a sales bonus upon achieving a significant sales target.
Shire may be entitled to refunds of amounts previously paid in the event of a delayed product approval.
b ADDERALL XR in Canada ADDERALL XR was made commercially available for the treatment of children in Canada during February 2004.
On 9 February 2005, Shire announced that Health Canada had suspended sales of ADDERALL XR in Canada where sales in 2004 amounted to $7.8 million.
Following the Health Canada announcement, the FDA issued a statement in which it advised that after consultation with the Canadian authorities regarding the basis for their action, it did not feel that any immediate changes were warranted in the FDA labelling or approved use of ADDERALL XR in the US based on its preliminary understanding of Health Canadas analyses of adverse event reports and the FDAs own knowledge and assessment of those reports.
Although Shire is complying with Health Canadas suspension request, Shire strongly disagrees with the conclusions drawn by Health Canada and has lodged an appeal and taken other actions to preserve its legal rights and options.

This structure enables people from different geographic and functional areas to work together closely and collaboratively to solve problems and to create new and better products.
More importantly, it provides Shire with the flexibility and nimbleness required for continued growth in an industry marked by rapid change and ever-increasing competition.

03 5977 Review 2004. qxd 5 9 05 5:21 PM Page 04 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Chief Executives review Everything that we have done this year has positioned us to leverage on our strengths and create an organization with sustainable growth Key milestones We achieved a lot this year.
Our operating profits were good and we made real progress with our new business strategy, which I outlined in this section of last years report.
In particular: we increased product sales and received more income from royalties: we turned in a solid financial performance, with revenues up 13%: we paid our first dividend: we moved our pipeline forward and achieved six new product approvals or line extensions in Europe and the US: and we made the business more focused, strengthened the management team and increased our R&D capabilities.
You may remember that last year I described how we intended to change the structure of the Company so that we could work more laterally and internationally across the organization, rather than in isolated silos.
We wanted simpler reporting lines and a business model that brought our drug development and commercial activities closer together and that is what we Matthew Emmens now have.
As a result, we are more competitive, Chief Executive Officer more accountable and more attuned to the particular needs of the specialist doctors who are our main customers.
Our technological and R&D efforts are now concentrated on highpotential treatments that are in the latter stages of development, which significantly reduces our risk profile.
As a result, we had six projects in registration at the end of the first quarter 2004, two more in Phase 3 of development and two in Phase 2 and by the end of the year wed received six drugs approvals in Europe and in the US, including: FOSRENOL in both the US and in Europe: PENTASA 500mg in the US: ADDERALL XR for adult patients in the US: EQUETRO in the US: and XAGRID in Europe.

60 5977 Accounts 2004. qxd 5 9 05 5:26 PM Page 61 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 1 Description of operations General Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc and its subsidiaries collectively referred to as Shire or the Company is a global pharmaceutical company with a strategic focus on meeting the needs of the specialist physician.
The Company has a particular interest in innovative therapies that are prescribed by specialist doctors as opposed to primary-care physicians.
The Company is focused on the development of late-stage projects and marketing products in the areas of Central Nervous System CNS, Gastro-Intestinal GI and General Products GP.
Geographically, the Company has operations in the worlds key pharmaceutical markets, namely North America and Europe.
The Companys business is organized across four operating segments: US, International covering territories outside of the US, Research & Development R&D and Corporate.
Revenues are derived primarily from three sources: sales of the Companys own products, royalties where Shire has out-licensed products to third parties and licensing and development fees.
Strategic review and reorganization In 2003, the Company conducted a detailed strategic review resulting in revised strategic priorities, namely that the Company will: search, develop and market but not invent: seek to acquire products with substantive patent protection rather than just three years Hatch-Waxman exclusivity: focus its in-licensing and merger and acquisition efforts on the US market and obtain European rights whenever possible.
As part of this process, Shire refocused its R&D efforts and technology to concentrate on areas where it had a commercial presence and to create the flexibility to add new therapeutic areas based on product acquisition opportunities.
This approach aimed to deliver the combined benefit of increased returns and lower risks.
In connection with the refocused R&D efforts, the Company decided to exit from early-stage therapeutic research Lead Optimization in 2003, to dispose of certain facilities in Canada see Note 3 and announced the planned disposal of the vaccines business.
During 2004, the Company announced that it would continue to focus on its new business strategy, including taking the following actions: a North American site consolidation, decreasing the number of operational sites from 14 to 6 in 2004 and the opening of a new US headquarters in Wayne, Pennsylvania: the disposal of the Companys vaccines business to ID Biomedical Corporation IDB, a Canadian biotechnology company, which was completed in the third quarter of 2004 see Note 3 : and the out-licensing of non-core projects including the acute myelogenous leukemia treatment TROXATYL troxacitabine to Structural GenomiX Inc. during the third quarter of 2004 and SPD754 for the treatment of HIV to Avexa Limited in January 2005.
These changes have had implications for both Shires organizational structure and operating sites.
The Company has a new global management structure aimed at close interaction between development, marketing and sales, and new people in key positions reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer.
The Company expects to complete the North American site consolidation in 2005.
To date the Company has recorded $48.5 million of costs associated with this site consolidation.
Substantial progress has been made and the Company anticipates completing the remaining actions in 2005.
Remaining costs associated with the reorganization are estimated to be approximately $12 million see Note 3.
There are inherent risks associated with any significant organizational change, including the possibility of disruption to the Companys business or the loss of key personnel.
Although a project team has been set up to actively manage the process and the associated risks, delays to R&D projects, failure to attain sales targets or other disruption to the business could occur as a result of the reorganization.
61 5977 Accounts 2004. qxd 5 9 05 5:26 PM Page 62 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 1 Description of operations continued Markets The Companys principal sources of revenue from its primary markets include: in the US, ADDERALL XR for the treatment of ADHD, AGRYLIN for the treatment of elevated blood platelets, PENTASA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis and CARBATROL for the treatment of epilepsy.
In addition, the Company receives royalties on sales of REMINYL for the treatment of Alzheimers disease, marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutica NV Janssen, and on EPIVIR, COMBIVIR and TRIZIVIR for the treatment of HIV AIDS, marketed by GSK: in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, the CALCICHEW range, used primarily as adjuncts in the treatment of osteoporosis, and REMINYL, which was co-promoted with Janssen-Cilag until May 3, 2004.
On May 3, 2004, the Company acquired from Janssen-Cilag the exclusive commercialization rights to REMINYL in the UK and Ireland: in Canada, 3TC and COMBIVIR for the treatment of HIV AIDS, HEPTOVIR for the treatment of hepatitis all marketed in partnership with GSK and AGRYLIN for the treatment of elevated blood platelets: and in the Rest of the World, royalties on the sales of ZEFFIX for the treatment of Hepatitis B, marketed by GSK, and royalties on sales of REMINYL, marketed by Janssen.
In addition to the above, the Company has a number of products that have been recently approved and projects that are currently in registration or late-stage development.
These include: Recently approved PENTASA for the treatment of ulcerative colitis.
On July 8, 2004 Shire received FDA approval to market the 500mg dosage strength of PENTASA in the US: ADDERALL XR for the treatment of adults with ADHD.
On August 12, 2004, the FDA approved a once-daily treatment for adults with ADHD: FOSRENOL for the treatment of high blood phosphate levels associated with end-stage renal disease.
On October 26, 2004 Shire received FDA approval to market FOSRENOL in 250mg and 500mg dosage strength in the US.
Approval was also gained in Sweden on March 19, 2004, and further regulatory approvals have been sought in a number of other EU Member States pursuant to the Mutual Recognition Process.
Following pricing and reimbursement discussions with individual countries, the launch of FOSRENOL in Europe will be phased during 2005: ADDERALL XR for the treatment of ADHD.
On October 28, 2004 the FDA granted an additional six months of market exclusivity in the US under the Hatch-Waxman regulations.
The additional exclusivity period will expire on April 11, 2005.
The extension followed submission of data from a clinical program examining the effects of ADDERALL XR in adolescent pediatric patients.
This data was submitted in response to a Written Request by the FDA: XAGRID trade name for AGRYLIN in EU for the treatment of elevated blood platelets.
EU approval was received in November 2004: launch commenced in January 2005 and will be phased through certain countries in Europe in 2005: and EQUETRO previously called SPD417 and BIPOTROL for bipolar disorder.
FDA approval was granted in December 2004.
Registration MTS METHYPATCH, a transdermal delivery system for the once-daily treatment of ADHD.
In April 2003 Shire received a not approvable letter from the FDA.
A program has been agreed with the FDA to address issues raised in this letter and this work is currently ongoing: and ADDERALL XR adolescent.
In September 2004 a supplemental new drug application for the use of ADDERALL XR in the adolescent population was submitted to the FDA.
It is anticipated that a response to this submission will be received during the second half of 2005.
Late-stage development SPD503 guanfacine for ADHD, which is in Phase III clinical trials: SPD476 for ulcerative colitis, which is in Phase III clinical trials: SPD465 for ADHD, which is in Phase II clinical trials: SPD480, which is a 5-ASA based product formulated in a single dose, 2g and 4g, foam for rectal delivery in the treatment of ulcerative colitis.

This product will provide an alternative treatment for distal rectal ulcerative colitis and has reached Phase II development: and NRP104 for ADHD which is in Phase III clinical trials.
62 5977 Accounts 2004. qxd 5 9 05 5:26 PM Page 63 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Shire and all of its subsidiary undertakings after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions.
b Use of estimates in consolidated financial statements The preparation of consolidated financial statements, in conformity with US generally accepted accounting principles, requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to provisions for sales deductions, valuation of intangible assets and fixed asset investments, contingent liabilities and the valuation of tax assets and liabilities.
c Revenue recognition The Company recognizes revenue when: there is persuasive evidence of an agreement or arrangement: delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered: the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable: and collectability is reasonably assured.
The Companys principal revenue streams and their respective accounting treatments are discussed below: i Product sales Revenue for the sales of products is recognized upon shipment to customers or at the time of delivery depending on the terms of sale.
Provisions for rebates, product returns and discounts to customers are provided for as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
The Company monitors and tracks the amount of rebates, product returns and discounts to customers based on historical experience to estimate the amount of reduction to revenue.
ii Licensing and development fees Licensing and development fees represent revenues derived from product out-licensing agreements and from contract R&D agreements.
Initial license fees received in connection with product out-licensing agreements, even where such fees are non-refundable and not creditable against future royalty payments, are deferred and recognized over the period of the license term, or the period of the associated collaborative assistance.
In circumstances where initial license fees are not for a defined period, revenues are deferred and recognized over the period to the expiration of the relevant patent to which the license relates.
Revenue from contract R&D agreements is recognized as the services are performed.
iii Royalty income Royalty income relating to licensed technology is recognized when the licensee sells the underlying product.
The Company receives sales information from the licensee on a monthly basis.
For any period that the information is not available, the Company estimates sales amounts based on the historical product information.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added tax and similar taxes, and trade discounts.
No revenue is recognized for consideration, the value or receipt of which is dependent on future events, future performance, or refund obligations.
iv Milestones During the term of certain R&D agreements and licensing agreements, the Company receives non-refundable milestones as certain technical targets are achieved.
Revenues are recognized on achievement of such milestones.
The Company also receives non-refundable clinical milestones when certain targets are achieved during the clinical phases of development, such as the submission of clinical data to a regulatory authority.
These clinical milestones are recognized when receivable i. e. on completion of the relevant phase.
63 5977 Accounts 2004. qxd 5 9 05 5:26 PM Page 64 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued d Cost of product sales Cost of sales includes both the cost of purchasing finished product for sale, together with the cost of raw materials and manufacturing for those products that are manufactured by Shire.
Royalties that are payable on those products that Shire does not own the rights to are also included in cost of sales.
e R&D R&D expenditures include funded and unfunded expenditures and are charged to operations in the period in which the expense is incurred.
f Leased assets The costs of operating leases are charged to operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease payments are recorded as liabilities, while the interest element is charged to operations over the period of the lease to produce a level yield on the balance of the capital lease obligation.
g Finance costs of debt Finance costs of debt are recorded as a deferred asset and then amortized to the statement of operations over the term of the debt, using the effective interest rate method.
Deferred financing costs relating to debt extinguishments are written off and reflected in interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations.
h Income taxes The Company provides for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards SFAS No.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are provided for differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future taxable or deductible amounts.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Income tax expense is computed as the tax payable or refundable for the period, plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.
i Earnings per share Earnings per share is computed in accordance with SFAS No.
Basic earnings per share is based upon net income available to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted earnings per share is based upon adjusted net income available to ordinary shareholders divided by the weighted average number of ordinary share equivalents outstanding during the period, adjusted for the effect of all dilutive potential ordinary shares that were outstanding during the year.
Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to increase earnings per share or reduce a loss per share.
j Advertising expense The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred.
Advertising costs amounted to $47.6 million, $40.7 million, and $45.6 million for the years to December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively.
k Foreign currency Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Transaction gains and losses are recognized in arriving at operating net income.
The results of overseas operations, whose functional currency is not US dollars, are translated at the average rates of exchange during the period and their balance sheets at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
The cumulative effect of exchange rate movements is included in a separate component of other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency exchange transaction gains and losses on an after-tax basis included in consolidated net income in the years to December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, amounted to a $2.5 million loss, $6.7 million loss and $0.3 million loss, respectively.

25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees APB No.
Accordingly, compensation cost of stock options is measured as the excess, if any, of the quoted market price of Shires ordinary shares at the measurement date over the option exercise price and is charged to operations over the vesting period.
For plans where the measurement date occurs after the grant date, referred to as variable plans, compensation cost is re-measured on the basis of the current market value of Shires ordinary shares at the end of each reporting period.
The Company recognizes compensation expense for variable plans with performance conditions if achievement of those conditions becomes probable.
123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation SFAS No.
123, the Company has included in these financial statements the required pro-forma disclosures as if the fair-value method of accounting had been applied.
As of December 31, 2004, the Company had six stock-based employee compensation plans, which are described more fully in Note 28.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No.

n Short-term investments Short-term investments consist of commercial paper and institutional and managed cash funds.
In accordance with SFAS No.
115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities SFAS No.
115, and based on the Companys intentions regarding these instruments, the Company has classified all short-term investments as of December 31, 2004, as available-for-sale.
Institutional and managed cash funds are short-term money market instruments, including bank and building society term deposits and other debt securities from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings.
o Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost including manufacturing overheads, where appropriate or net realizable value.
Net realizable value is based on estimated normal selling price less further costs expected to be incurred to completion and disposal.
65 5977 Accounts 2004. qxd 5 9 05 5:26 PM Page 66 Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc Notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands of US dollars, except where indicated 2 Summary of significant accounting policies continued p Investments The Company has certain investments in pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
Investments are accounted for using the equity-method of accounting if the investment gives the Company the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control over, the investee.
Significant influence is generally deemed to exist if the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors, such as representation on the investees Board of Directors and the impact of commercial arrangements, are considered in determining whether the equity-method of accounting is appropriate.
Under the equity-method of accounting, the Company records its investments in equity-method investees in the consolidated balance sheet as Investments equity-method investments and its share of the investees earnings or losses together with other-than-temporary impairments in value as Equity in losses earnings of equity-method investees in the consolidated statement of operations.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method or at fair value.
Investments in private companies are carried at cost, less provisions for other-than-temporary impairment in value.
For public companies that have readily determinable fair values, the Company classifies its equity investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, records these investments at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses included in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, net of any related tax effect.
Realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale securities are included in other expense, net see Note 24.
The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method.
Interest and dividends on securities classified as available-forsale are included as interest income.
q Goodwill and other intangible assets i Goodwill In a business combination, goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are not amortized to operations, but instead are reviewed for impairment, at least annually, or when there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives, other than goodwill.
The Company has determined that there are no impairment losses for any of the reporting periods covered by these financial statements.
ii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets, which comprise intellectual property including trade marks for products with a defined revenue stream namely commercial products or rights to products awaiting final regulatory approval, are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the related product, which ranges from 5 to 35 years weighted average 23 years.
Intellectual property with no defined revenue stream, where the related product has not yet completed the necessary approval process, is written off to operations on acquisition.
The following factors are considered in estimating useful lives.
Where an intangible asset is a composite of a number of factors, the period of amortization is determined from considering these factors together: expected use of the asset: regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and actions by government agencies: the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing products and other economic factors, including the stability of the market, known technological advances, development of competing drugs that are more effective clinically or economically: and actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies or others that may eliminate current competitive advantages.

The cost of significant assets includes capitalized interest incurred during the construction period.
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated useful life as follows: Buildings 20-50 years Office furniture, fittings and equipment 4-10 years Warehouse, laboratory and manufacturing equipment 4-10 years The cost of land is not depreciated.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred.
The costs of major renewals and improvements are capitalized.
At the time property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation accounts.
The profit or loss on such disposition is reflected in operating income.
s Valuation and impairment of long-lived assets other than goodwill and investments The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived assets other than goodwill and investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable.
When such a determination is made, managements estimate of undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets is compared to the carrying value of the assets to determine whether an impairment has occurred.
If an impairment is indicated, the amount of the impairment recognized in the consolidated financial statements is determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss for the amount that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value.
This fair value is usually determined based on estimated discounted cash flows.
t Assets held for sale An asset is classified as held for sale when, amongst other things, the Company has committed to a plan of disposition, the asset is available for immediate sale, and the plan is not expected to change significantly.
u Sales deductions i Rebates Rebates primarily consist of statutory rebates to state Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with health-maintenance organizations HMOs.
These rebates are based on price differentials between a base price and the selling price.
As a result, rebates generally increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of the product as prices increase.
Provisions for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales, with estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends.
ii Returns The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will result in a return, based on historical trends and, when applicable, specific factors affecting certain products at the balance sheet date.
The accrual is recorded as a reduction to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded.
iii Coupons The Company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive.
An accrual is established based on the Companys expectation of the level of coupon redemption, using historical trends.
iv Discounts The Company offers cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables.
Those discounts are recorded as reductions to revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded.
v Wholesaler chargebacks The Company has contractual agreements with third parties to supply certain products at predetermined prices.
Wholesalers acting as intermediaries in these transactions are reimbursed by Shire, if this price is less than the price paid by the wholesaler to Shire.
Provisions for wholesaler chargebacks based on historical trends are recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded.

The special ordinary voting shares are entitled to dividend and other rights that are economically equivalent to those of the ordinary shares.
ii Dividends Under English law, Shire can pay dividends only out of its distributable profits, defined as the accumulated realized profits under UK generally accepted accounting principles, of the parent company Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc and not the consolidated group, so far as not previously utilized by distribution or capitalization, less accumulated realized and unrealized losses, so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital duly made.
The Company can make a distribution only if the distribution does not reduce net assets below the aggregate of the called-up share capital and undistributable reserves.
Any payment of dividends is at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be made in Pounds sterling to Ordinary Shareholders, US dollars to ADS holders and Canadian dollars to Exchangeable Shareholders.
At December 31, 2004, Shires distributable profits were 86.4 million $165.9 million.
iii Treasury stock The Company records the purchase of its own shares as a reduction of shareholders equity based on the price paid for the shares.
w Concentration of risk Revenues are mainly derived in the US 69% of total revenues from agreements with major pharmaceutical companies and relationships with pharmaceutical wholesale distributors and retail pharmacy chains.
Significant customers are disclosed in Note 23.
Such clients have significant cash resources and therefore any credit risk associated with these transactions is considered minimal.
Excess cash is invested in bank and building society term deposits and commercial paper from a variety of companies with strong credit ratings.
These investments typically bear minimal credit risk.
A significant proportion of revenue is derived from sales of ADDERALL XR and royalties received on 3TC.
During 2004, revenues from these products were $606.7 million and $155.8 million, representing 45% and 11% of total revenues respectively.
As a result, factors affecting the sale or production of ADDERALL XR or 3TC would have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operation.
x Non-monetary transactions The Company enters into certain non-monetary transactions that involve either the granting of a license over the Companys patents or the disposal of an asset or group of assets in exchange for a non-monetary asset, usually equity.
The Company accounts for these transactions at fair value where the Company is able to determine the fair value within reasonable limits.
To the extent that the Company concludes that it is unable to determine the fair value of a transaction, that transaction is accounted for at the recorded amounts of the assets.
Management is required to exercise its judgment in determining whether or not the fair value of the asset received or that given up can be determined.
In doing so, management considers, amongst other things, previous license agreements over similar intellectual property rights where there is monetary consideration.
The Company has a limited number of comparable historical license agreements.
Management has determined that for all non-monetary transactions recorded to date the fair value of the consideration is not determinable: consequently, such transactions have been recognized at recorded value.
In the future, as Shire engages in further transactions, there may be a fair value assigned to similar transactions resulting in a different accounting treatment.
y Reclassifications Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2004 presentation.
In addition the 2002 and 2003 financial statements have been restated to reflect the disposal of the vaccines business, which has been treated as a discontinued operation.
z New accounting pronouncements i Adopted in the current year FIN 46R In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued a revision to FASB Interpretation No.
46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities VIE, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin ARB No.
51 FIN 46R, which requires a VIE to be consolidated by a Company that will absorb a majority of the VIEs expected losses, receive a majority of the entitys expected residual returns, or both, as a result of ownership, contractual or other financial interest in the VIE.
Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, VIEs were generally consolidated by companies owning a majority voting interest in the VIE.
The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R applied immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, however, the FASB deferred the effective date for VIEs created before February 1, 2003 to the quarter ended March 31, 2004 for calendar-year companies.
Adoption of the provisions of FIN 46R prior to the deferred effective date was permitted.
The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Company.

EITF 03-01 is applicable to a debt and equity securities within the scope of FAS No.
115, b debt and equity securities within the scope of SFAS No.
124 and that are held by an investor that reports a performance indicator, and c equity securities not within the scope of SFAS No.
115 and not accounted for under the Accounting Principles Board Opinion 18s equity-method e. g. investments in private companies.
EITF 03-01 provides a step model to determine whether an investment is impaired and if an impairment is other-than-temporary.
In addition, it requires that investors provide certain disclosures for investments in private companies and, if applicable, other information related specifically to investments in private companies, such as the aggregate carrying amount of investments in private companies, the aggregate amount of investments in private companies that the investor did not evaluate for impairment because an impairment indicator was not present, and the situations under which the fair value of an investment in a private company is not estimated.
The disclosures relating to investments in private companies should not be aggregated with other types of investments.
The effective date for the prospective application of EITF 03-01 impairment model to all current and future investments has been delayed by FASB Staff Position EITF 03-01.
The disclosure requirements are effective for annual periods for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004, therefore December 31, 2004 in the case of the Company.
SFAS 123R In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No.
123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS No.
123R requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at fair value and that excess tax benefits be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.
123R is effective for the Company from July 1, 2005.
123R permits public companies to account for share-based payments using one of two methods: modified-prospective method or  method.
Under the modified-prospective method, from the effective date, compensation cost is recognized based on the requirements of SFAS No.
123R for all new share-based awards and based on the requirements of SFAS No.
123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS No.
123R that remain unvested on the effective date.
The requirements of the  method are as above, with the exception that companies are permitted to restate, based on the amounts previously recognized under SFAS No.
123 for pro-forma disclosure purposes, either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods in the year of adoption.
123 pro-forma disclosures given in Note 2 above show the impact of the Company adopting SFAS No.
The Company has yet to determine which method of transition will be adopted or the adoption date.
aa Statutory accounts The consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and for each of the three years in the period to December 31, 2004 do not comprise statutory accounts within the meaning of Section 240 of the UK Companies Act 1985.
Statutory accounts prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United Kingdom for the years to December 31, 2003 and 2002 have been delivered to the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales.
The auditors report on those accounts was unqualified.
3 Reorganizations Actions commenced in 2004 i North American site consolidation As previously disclosed, Shire began a consolidation of its North American sites in 2004, decreasing the number of sites from 14 to 6 and opening a new US headquarters office in Wayne, Pennsylvania.
The Company recorded costs of $48.5 million in 2004 and estimates further costs of approximately $12 million in 2005.
The site consolidation is expected to be complete by the end of 2005.
The primary costs associated with the site consolidation include: severance costs relating to 138 employees: retention payments to key employees: relocation costs relating to 85 employees who were moved to Wayne, Pennsylvania: costs of duplicate facilities including lease exit costs : and other incremental costs associated with the site closures, such as legal, consultancy, the write-down of property, plant and equipment and information technology costs.

The total consideration for the sale was $120 million comprising $30 million of cash received at completion, $30 million of cash held in escrow and due on the first anniversary of closing and $60 million received at completion in the form of 4,931,864 subscription receipts of IDB.
Each subscription receipt entitled Shire to acquire, at any time during the period from January 10, 2005 to July 9, 2006, for no additional consideration, one fully paid common share of IDB.
Prior to January 10, 2005, if IDB were to raise up to $60 million from equity-related issuances then they were required to repurchase the subscription receipts from Shire for $60 million in cash.
On December 21, 2004, IDB gave notification that it intended to complete a convertible debt issuance on January 7, 2005 and subsequently repurchased the subscription receipts from Shire on January 7, 2005.
In addition to the $120 million consideration, IDB was required to reimburse Shire in full for the net cost of operating the vaccines business from June 30, 2004 through consummation of the sale.
As part of the transaction, Shire entered into an agreement to provide IDB with a loan facility of up to $100 million, which can be drawn down over the four years following completion.
Drawings under the loan facility will be segregated into two components: i drawings for injectable flu development of up to $30 million.
Such drawings under the loan facility will be repayable out of income generated by IDB on future non-Canadian injectable flu products, subject to minimum annual repayments in respect of the $30 million drawing, to be made between 2007 and 2017: and ii drawings for pipeline development from the balance of the $100 million loan facility of up to $70 million.
Such drawings will be repayable out of income generated by IDB on future pipeline products and will have no fixed repayment schedule.
As of December 31, 2004, IDB had drawn down $56.8 million: $30.0 million for injectable flu development and $26.8 million for pipeline development.
The transaction gave rise to an overall loss on disposition of the vaccines business of $44 million, which comprises a gain on disposal of net assets of $26 million together with a provision for a loss of $70 million out of the $100 million loan facility available to IDB.
This provision is made on the basis that loan repayments based solely on the future sales of pipeline products in development provide no certainty of recovery.
The historical consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the vaccines business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
The results of the discontinued operation have been removed from all periods on a line-by-line basis from product sales revenue to income from continuing operations.
The net loss from the discontinued operation, together with the loss on disposal, are shown as separate line items.
Operating results of the discontinued operations are summarized below.

As of December 2004, all employees had left the Company: a $6.0 million write-off of tangible fixed assets.
These assets, primarily laboratory equipment, were used by Lead Optimization for R&D and had no alternative use: and the cancellation, to the extent possible, of contracts directly relating to Lead Optimization.

As a result of this initial process the Company decided to dispose of its building in Laval, Canada, and to relocate the employees.
The Company also decided to sell its building in Buffalo Grove.
As of December 31, 2003, the Company had obtained valuations of the properties and entered into sale negotiations with third parties on the Laval property and was actively seeking buyers for its Buffalo Grove facility.
Based on these negotiations, the valuations obtained, the limitations on use of the building in its current state and the overall real estate market, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $10.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2003, which is included in reorganization costs in the consolidated statement of operations.
The Company reclassified to prepaid expenses and other current assets the assets held for sale.

SUMI acquisition On September 27, 2002, the Company completed its acquisition of SUMI from Niro Inc. for a cash consideration of $17.3 million, including $0.3 million costs of acquisition.
This transaction provided the Company with an in-house facility in which to manufacture several key US products.
The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method and goodwill of $10.2 million was recorded.
The results of operations of SUMI have been included in the consolidated results of the Company since the date of acquisition.
The purchase price of $17.3 million was allocated as follows: Fair value $000 Total current assets 3,188 Property, plant and equipment, net 11,620 Current instalments of long-term debt 216 Accounts payable 1,367 Long-term debt, excluding current instalments 6,050 Net assets acquired 7,175 Goodwill 10,175 17,350 Represented by Purchase consideration 17,000 Acquisition fees 350 17,350 The following unaudited consolidated pro-forma results of operations for the year to December 31, 2002 gave effect to the acquisition of SUMI as if it were completed at the beginning of the period.
These pro-forma results reflect incremental financing costs resulting from acquisition and the amortization of acquired intangible assets: 2002 Year to December 31, $000 Revenues 1,042,748 Net income 248,983 Earnings per share basic 49.7 Earnings per share diluted 48.7 This unaudited pro-forma financial information has been prepared for comparative purposes only and does not purport to represent the results of operations which would actually have occurred had the companies operated as one during the period, nor to predict the Companys results of future operations.
5 Disposal of the Over-The-Counter OTC business In December 1999 the Company acquired a group of products, collectively referred to as the OTC portfolio, through its merger with Roberts Pharmaceutical Corporation Roberts.
The OTC portfolio consisted of non-prescription laxatives and dietary supplements sold by the Companys US operating segment.
As a pharmaceuticals company that focuses on prescription-only products, this part of the business was not considered to be a core part of the Companys long-term strategy and hence the decision was made to divest the OTC portfolio.
On December 27, 2002, the Company completed its divestment of the OTC business.
The Company received sale proceeds of $71.0 million and recorded a gain on disposal of $2.1 million.
The historical consolidated financial statements were restated to reflect the OTC business as a discontinued operation for all periods presented.
Operating results of the discontinued operation for 2002 are summarized below.
The amounts include income tax provisions based on the stand-alone results of the OTC business.
There have been no allocations of general and administrative corporate costs or interest expense related to corporate credit facilities to the business.
As the OTC business functioned within the US, which itself essentially functions as an independent entity, no corporate costs were eliminated upon discontinuance of the operation.
Within the US, the OTC business had few dedicated resources.
All of the products were manufactured and packaged by third-party contract manufacturers.
The products were distributed through a shared warehouse facility and sold through a small sales team.

These investments were appropriately reclassified to equity-method investments upon the adoption of FIN 46R.
The Company recorded impairments of $15.4 million on its investments during the year to December 31, 2004 2003: $15.5 million: 2002 $8.7 million.
All impairments in the three years presented were recorded in the International segment.
a Investments in private companies During the year to December 31, 2004 the Company recorded impairments of $9.8 million against these investments based on changes in the estimates of their fair value.
This amount includes $4.2 million to reduce the value of an investment in a private company that gained a listing on March 24, 2004: the initial listing price was below the anticipated flotation price used to value the investment at December 31, 2003 see below and the Company believes the decline in value was other-than-temporary.
After the date of the listing the investment was reclassified to available-for-sale securities and so any changes since the initial listing date have been recorded in other comprehensive income.
During the year to December 31, 2003, the Company recorded impairments of $15.5 million.
An impairment of $6.2 million was recorded to reduce the carrying value of the investment in the private company seeking a listing see above to one based on the anticipated flotation price for the share offering early in 2004.
Also, an impairment of $8.5 million was recorded in relation to the GeneChem Funds investment, following reviews of the Funds investment portfolios that identified other-than-temporary declines in the value of certain private and publicly quoted securities held by the Funds.
During the year to December 31, 2002, the Company recorded impairments of $6.6 million due to a decrease in the market value of its investment in private companies based on changes in estimates in value from the prior year.
The changes in fair market value which resulted in the write-downs referred to above were based on the Companys estimates of fair value.
These estimates were derived from financial and other publicly available information such as press releases and recent capital raising activities.
b Available-for-sale securities i Gain on sale During the year to December 31, 2004, the Company sold an investment in an available-for-sale security, valued at $11.9 million, realizing a gain on the sale of $14.8 million 2003: $nil.

The weighted average amortization period for these additions is 9.5 years.
Amortization charged for the three years to December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $38.7 million, $26.4 million and $20.8 million, respectively.
Goodwill was no longer amortized with effect from January 1, 2002 following the adoption of SFAS No.
142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets SFAS No.
The useful economic lives of other intangible assets continue to be amortized under SFAS No.
Management estimates that the annual amortization charges in respect of intangible fixed assets held as of December 31, 2004 will average approximately $40 million for each of the five years to December 31, 2009.
Estimated amortization expense can be affected by various factors including future acquisitions, disposals of product rights and the technological advancement and regulatory approval of competitor products.
During 2004, the Company recorded impairments of $13.5 million.
These impairments resulted from a change of operational management and its views of the economic value and strategic worth of the products concerned, which decreased estimated future cash flows.
$1.5 million of these impairments were recorded in the US segment and $12.0 million in the International segment.
During 2003 the Company recorded asset impairments of $12.1 million 2002: $18.8 million and an asset write-down of $15.4 million.
The asset impairments of $12.1 million resulted from a decline in product prices, which decreased estimated future cash flows.
The asset write-down of $15.4 million resulted from a decision not to renew product licenses that were not core to the business.
The impairments and write-downs totalling $27.5 million were recorded in the US segment $11.7 million and the International segment $15.8 million.
During 2002 the Company reviewed its existing product base.
On completion of this review, management decided to cease supporting certain products that were not considered to be core to the business and to redirect investment toward other more profitable products.
Intangible assets associated with these products, namely product rights and licenses, were written down to their fair value based on discounted cash flow analyses.
This resulted in the recording of an impairment loss of $18.8 million $10.8 million in the US segment and $8.0 million in the International segment.
The net book value of goodwill by operating segment is as follows: US International Corporate R&D Total December 31, $000 $000 $000 $000 $000 2004 205,386 30,010 235,396 2003 193,023 28,298 221,321 There were no changes in the allocation of goodwill in either period.

19 Financial instruments The estimated fair value of the Companys financial instruments as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 is summarized below.
Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts.
The fair-value amounts shown below are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition nor do they indicate the Companys intent or ability to dispose of the financial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of financial instrument: Short-term investments commercial paper and institutional and managed cash funds the carrying value approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
Investments the carrying value of non-current investments with readily determinable market values equals the fair value as such instruments are marked to market.
Long-term debt the fair value of long-term debt is estimated based on the discounted future cash flows using currently available interest rates or, where the debt instrument is traded, by reference to the market price.
IDB subscription receipts the carrying value equals the fair value as the subscription receipts were repurchased on January 7, 2005 for $60 million.
The carrying amounts and corresponding fair values of financial instruments are as follows: Carrying amount Fair value December 31, 2004 $000 $000 Financial assets: Commercial paper 149,659 149,659 Institutional and managed cash funds 174,752 175,185 Investments 29,970 29,970 IDB subscription receipts 60,000 60,000 Financial liabilities: Long-term debt 116 117 Carrying amount Fair value December 31, 2003 $000 $000 Financial assets: Commercial paper 120,872 120,872 Institutional and managed cash funds 183,257 183,257 Investments 21,879 21,879 Financial liabilities: Long-term debt 376,017 378,005 The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.

5, Accounting for Contingencies SFAS No.
5, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss.
Where the estimated loss lies within a range and no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount is recorded.
In other cases managements best estimate of the loss is recorded.
These estimates are developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known and the estimates are refined each accounting period in light of additional information being known.
In instances where the Company is unable to develop a best estimate of loss, no litigation loss is recorded at that time.
As information becomes known a loss provision is set up when a best estimate can be made.
The best estimates are reviewed quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised.
Any outcome upon settlement that deviates from the Companys best estimate may result in an additional expense in a future accounting period.
ii Phentermine Shire US Inc.

iii ADDERALL XR a Barr Laboratories, Inc. Shires extended-release once-daily version of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, is covered by US patent No.
In January 2003 the Company was notified that Barr Laboratories, Inc. Barr had submitted an Abbreviated New Drug Application ANDA under the US Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic versions of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg and 30mg strengths of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the Companys 819 Patent.
The notification alleged that the 819 Patent is not infringed by Barrs extended-release mixed amphetamine salt product, which is the subject of Barrs ANDA.
On February 24, 2003 Shire Laboratories Inc. Shire Laboratories filed suit against Barr in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging that Barrs ANDA infringes the 819 Patent.
The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Barr from commercializing its ANDA product before the expiration of the 819 Patent, damages in the event that Barr should engage in such commercialization, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.
On August 12, 2003, Shire Laboratories was issued a new US patent No.
In August 2003 Shire was notified that Barr had submitted an ANDA under the US Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market its generic versions of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg, 25mg and 30mg strengths of ADDERALL XR prior to the expiration date of the 300 Patent and alleging that the 300 Patent is invalid.

On September 27, 2004, Barr filed an amended Answer, Affirmative Defense and Counterclaim in which Barr added the following counterclaims and affirmative defenses: invalidity of the 819 Patent, non-infringement of the 300 Patent and unenforceability of the 819 and 300 Patents due to inequitable conduct.
Shire has asserted affirmative defenses, alleging, among other things, that Barr has waived its right to assert the counterclaims set forth in its September 27, 2004 amended answers.
Barr may not launch a generic version of ADDERALL XR before it receives final approval of its ANDA from the FDA.
Even if Barr receives a tentative approval from the FDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the latest stay February 2006 or a district court decision in its favor.
In the event that Barr receives a favorable decision before the expiration of the stay, then Barr could be in a position to market its extended-release mixed amphetamine salt product, upon FDA final approval of its ANDA, following the expiration of the Hatch-Waxman exclusivity period.
However, on October 28, 2004 the FDA granted an additional six months exclusivity to ADDERALL XR based upon pediatric studies carried out on the drug product, meaning that Barr may not market its ANDA products until after Hatch-Waxman exclusivity expires on April 11, 2005. b Impax Laboratories, Inc.

The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Impax from commercializing its ANDA product before the expiration of the 819 and 300 Patents, damages in the event that Impax should engage in such commercialization, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.
A trial date of October 11, 2005 has been set.
In December 2004, Shire received an additional notification from Impax advising of the filing of an ANDA for generic versions of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 25mg strengths of ADDERALL XR in addition to the 30mg strength, the subject of Impaxs initial ANDA.
The Company is also seeking an injunction to prevent Impax from commercializing its amended ANDA products before the expiration of the 819 and 300 Patents, damages in the event that Impax should engage in such commercialization, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.
Even if Impax receives a tentative approval from the FDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the stays May 2006 in the case of the 30mg strength and June 2007 in the case of the 5mg, 10mg, 15mg, 20mg and 25mg strengths or a district court decision in its favor.
In the event that Impax receives a favorable decision before the expiration of the stays, then Impax could be in a position to market its extended-release mixed amphetamine salt products upon FDA final approval of its ANDA following the expiration of the existing Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and upon the expiration of the first to files exclusivity rights.
However, on October 28, 2004 the FDA granted an additional six months exclusivity to ADDERALL XR based upon pediatric studies carried out on the drug product, meaning that Impax may not market its ANDA products until after Hatch-Waxman exclusivity expires on April 11, 2005. c Colony Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

iv CARBATROL In August 2003 the Company was notified that Nostrum Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Nostrum had submitted an ANDA under the US HatchWaxman Act seeking permission to market its generic version of the 300mg strength of CARBATROL prior to the expiration date of the Companys US patents for CARBATROL, US patent No.
The notification alleges that the 013 and 570 Patents are not infringed by Nostrums 300mg extended-release carbamazepine product, the subject of Nostrums ANDA.
On September 18, 2003 Shire Laboratories filed suit against Nostrum in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey for infringement of these two patents.
The Company was also seeking an injunction to prevent Nostrum from commercializing its ANDA product before the expiration of the 013 and 570 Patents, damages in the event that Nostrum should engage in such commercialization, as well as its attorneys fees and costs.

On July 12, 2004 the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey dismissed Nostrums abuse of process counterclaim for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.
On December 10, 2004 Nostrum filed a summary judgment motion seeking a declaration of non-infringement of the 570 Patent.
Shires opposition to this motion was filed on January 14, 2005.
Even if Nostrum receives tentative approval from the FDA for its ANDA, it cannot lawfully launch its generic version before the earlier of the expiration of the stay February 2006 or a district court decision in its favor.

Company contributions to personal defined contribution pension plans totaled $9.0 million, $16.1 million and $6.8 million for the years to December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 respectively, and were charged to operations as they became payable.
b Defined benefit pension plan Roberts, a company with which the Company merged in December 1999, operated a defined SERP for certain US employees, which was established in 1998.
This plan was available to former employees of Roberts who met certain age and service requirements.
As part of the restructuring of the Company following the Roberts merger, the SERP was closed to new members and contributions ceased being paid into the plan for existing members.
As part of this arrangement, the Company paid a lump sum contribution into the plan of $18.0 million, the result of which is that the Company has no future contributions to make under the plan.
In accordance with EITF 97-14, the asset and liability of $7.7 million and $5.5 million, respectively, are shown on the balance sheet within the categories Other non-current assets, Other current liabilities and Other non-current liabilities.

The valuation allowance relates to the deferred tax assets arising from operating loss carry-forwards and capital loss carry-forwards, which have no expiration date.
The utilization of operating loss carry-forwards is, however, restricted to the taxable income of the subsidiary generating the losses.
In addition, capital loss carry-forwards can be offset only against capital gains.
As of December 31, 2004, based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are anticipated to reverse, and reasonable and feasible tax-planning strategies, management believes it is more likely than not that the Company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances.
However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if estimates of taxable income are revised.
As of December 31, 2004 the Company has not made a UK tax provision on approximately $1.4 billion of unremitted earnings of the Companys international subsidiaries.
It is not practical to determine the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities for temporary differences relating to these investments.

28 Stock incentive plans The Company has granted options to directors and employees over ordinary shares under the following six stock option plans: i Shire Pharmaceuticals Executive Share Option Scheme Parts A and B Executive Scheme Options granted under the Executive Scheme are subject to performance criteria and cannot be exercised in full, unless Shires ordinary share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period.
If Shires ordinary share price increases at a compound rate of 14.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, 60% of the options may be exercised.
On February 28, 2000, the Remuneration Committee of the Board exercised its powers to amend the terms of the Executive Share Option Scheme so as to include a cliff vesting provision.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the Executive Scheme.
ii Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 2000 Executive Scheme Options granted under this scheme are exercisable subject to certain performance criteria.
In respect of any option granted prior to August 2002, if Shires ordinary share price increases at a compound rate of at least 20.5% per annum over a minimum three-year measurement period, the option becomes exercisable in full.
If it increases by at least 14.5% per annum over the same three-year period, 60% of the options granted become exercisable.
Given Shires development, it was considered appropriate that an earnings per share based measure should be adopted in place of share price growth targets.
Therefore, the performance criteria were amended so that an option would become exercisable in full if Shires fully diluted earnings per share growth over a three-year period from the date of award exceeds the UK Retail Price Index RPI on average a year for the following tranches of grants: Options with a grant value of up to 100% of salary RPI plus 3% per annum directors, RPI plus 5% Between 101% and 200% of salary RPI plus 5% per annum Between 201% and 300% of salary RPI plus 7% per annum Over 301% of salary RPI plus 9% per annum The new earnings per share performance criteria apply to options granted under the 2000 Executive Scheme from August 2002.
After consultation with certain of its institutional shareholders, the Company has decided that for options granted under the scheme from 2004 onwards, the retest of the performance condition if Shires earnings per share growth has fallen short of the minimum annual average percentage increase over the three-year period from grant, has been changed.
The performance condition will be retested once only, at five years after the grant.
Hence the level of earnings per share growth in the next two years needs to be consequentially higher to meet the test.
Six weeks prior to the expiration date, any options that have not become exercisable at an earlier date, automatically vest without reference to the performance criteria.

v Pharmavene 1991 Stock Option Plan SLI Plan Options issued under the SLI Plan were originally granted over shares in SLI, formerly Pharmavene Inc. a company acquired by the Company on March 23, 1997.
Exercise of these options results in the option holder receiving ordinary shares in Shire.
As a result of the acquisition of SLI, and in accordance with the terms of the original share option plan, all options granted under that plan became immediately capable of exercise.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the SLI Plan.
vi BioChem Stock Option Plan BioChem Plan Following the acquisition of BioChem Pharma Inc. on May 11, 2001, the BioChem Stock Option Plan was amended such that options over BioChem Pharma Inc. s common stock became options over ordinary shares of Shire.
All BioChem Pharma Inc. options, which were not already exercisable, vested and became exercisable as a result of the acquisition.
It is intended that no further options will be granted under the BioChem Stock Option Plan.
In a period of ten years, not more than 10% of the issued share capital of Shire may be placed under option under any employee share scheme.
In addition, the following terms apply to options that may be granted under the various plans: 2000 Executive Scheme: the maximum number of Shire ordinary shares over which incentive options may be granted under Part 3 of the scheme is 25,000,000.
Stock Purchase Plan: up to 2,000,000 Shire ordinary shares.
