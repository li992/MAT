Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies i Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modied to include the revaluation of xed asset investments, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP dated January 2003.
All of the Companys operations are of a continuing nature.
ii Valuation of xed asset investments UK listed investments are valued according to the prices issued by the London Stock Exchange, being the closing mid-market prices or the last traded price as appropriate.
Overseas listed investments and investments which are quoted but are unlisted are valued at their closing middle market prices as issued by various sources.
Unquoted investments are valued by the directors based on a combination of factors relating to the investee companies, such as third party transactions in the shares, earnings multiples and net asset values.
iii Associated undertakings Where the Company holds investments representing more than 20% of a class of equity share capital, they are not accounted for as associated undertakings if, in the opinion of the directors, the Company does not exercise significant inuence over the financial or operating policies of the investee companies.
iv Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on investments, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in other reserves.
v Income Dividends receivable from equity shares are taken to the revenue account on an ex-dividend basis and net of related tax credit.
Bank deposit interest is accounted for on an accruals basis.
vi Expenses and finance costs All expenses and finance costs are accounted for on an accruals basis.
In accordance with the Boards expectation, over the long term, that investment returns will be attributable 75% to capital gains and 25% to revenue, the Company charges to capital 75% of the finance costs and management fees.
All other expenses are charged to revenue.
Expenses which are incidental to the purchase or sale of a xed asset investment are included in the cost or deducted from the proceeds of sale of the investment.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
Details of the performance fee arrangements are given in the Directors Report.
vii Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date, other than those differences regarded as permanent.
Any liability to deferred tax is provided at the average rate of tax expected to apply.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted to reect the time value of money.
Because the Company intends each year to qualify as an investment trust under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, no provision is made for deferred taxation in respect of the capital gains that have been realised, or are expected in the future to be realised, on the sale of xed asset investments.
viii Allocation of tax relief The tax relief available to the Company on its management, administrative and finance costs is allocated between revenue and capital according to the marginal basis whereby revenue expenses are matched first against taxable income arising in the revenue account.
ix Foreign currency Transactions denominated in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rate.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling on that date.
In the case of forward exchange contracts entered into to hedge uctuating exchange rates on foreign currency assets or liabilities, the difference between the value at the contracted forward rate and the forward rate ruling at the balance sheet date is included as a debtor or provided for as a creditor and included within other reserves.

The difference is explained below.

No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2003: nil.
d Factors that may effect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 11,217,000 2003: 7,909,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
38 9 Dividends The proposed final dividend of 4.90p per ordinary share 2003: 4.60p has been calculated using the number of shares in issue at 31 December 2004, being 338,944,785 2003: 343,518,086.
10 Return per ordinary share The revenue return per ordinary share is based on the earnings attributable to the ordinary shares of 29,330,000 2003: 31,279,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 25p each in issue during the year of 339,685,587 2003: 348,414,853.
The capital return per ordinary share is based on the net capital gains for the year of 90,159,000 2003: 169,696,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares of 25p each in issue, as stated above.

At 31 December 2004 none of these investments represented more than 1% of the xed asset investments and therefore are not considered significant in the context of these accounts.
Where the Company holds investments representing more than 20% of a class of equity share capital, they are not accounted for as associated undertakings if, in the opinion of the directors, the Company does not exercise significant inuence over the financial or operating policies of the investee companies.

40 15 Financial instruments i Management of risk The Companys financial instruments comprise: equity shares, bonds, cash, index futures and other derivatives that are held in accordance with the Companys investment objective as set out on page 1: debenture stock, secured bonds, preference shares, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Companys operations: and cash and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Companys operations.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings and futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the portfolio managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are due to uctuations in market prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Companys operations.
It represents the potential loss the Company might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specic to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and stock selection are other factors which act to reduce market price risk.
The portfolio managers actively monitor market prices throughout the year and report to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Foreign currency risk The Companys total return and net assets can be signicantly affected by uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of the Companys assets and revenue are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The international spread of investments acts to reduce this risk.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are limited to levels appropriate to the asset exposure to those currencies.
Interest rate risk The Company nances its operations through its debenture stock, secured bonds, preference shares and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Company borrows, in sterling or in foreign currencies, at both xed and oating rates of interest.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure that gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these limits on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Companys assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Companys existing borrowings is set out in paragraph iii on page 42.
Short term exibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk The Company places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution of which it is a creditor.
The Company expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
The Company lends securities from its portfolio, within limits set by the Board.
It receives collateral of a value greater than the value of the securities lent, usually, in respect of UK securities, in the form of Crest DBVs.
This collateral is subject to concentration limits, to a margin of a set percentage and to regular revaluation.

iv Currency exposure A portion of the financial assets and financial liabilities of the Company are denominated in currencies other than sterling with the effect that the net assets and total return can be signicantly affected by currency movements.
v Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities All of the financial assets of the Company are held at fair value.
