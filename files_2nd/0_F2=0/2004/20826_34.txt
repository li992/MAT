The total charges for all schemes are shown in the table below, together with the Groups share.

Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyds market.
As a consequence of the consolidation in the market, employers closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, there are now only around eight employers with active members in the Fund.
A large proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund.
The assets of the Fund are pooled and the current active employers are responsible collectively for the funding of the Fund as a whole.
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustees have split the Fund into a number of notional sections.
This is a notional split and has no legal force.
Previously this notional split allowed for separate sections in respect of each employers active members and one combined section for non-employed members of all current and former employers.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the Trustees altered this notional split so that, from that date, the active employers contributing to the Fund, including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, deferred pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities.
A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former employers no longer contribute to the Fund Orphan Scheme.
Amlin is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Schemes liabilities.
Since this alteration Amlin can now more clearly identify its expected contribution requirement to the Fund.
However, as the asset allocation is notional and at the discretion of the Trustees, it is not possible for Amlin to be certain of its overall surplus or deficit position at any time.
For this reason, the scheme is classified as a multi-employer scheme for the purposes of Financial Reporting Standard No.
The total charge for this scheme for Syndicate 2001 and Amlin group companies is analysed in the table below, together with the Groups share.
Total charge 2004 2003 m m Contributions relating to: 2001 valuation deficit Amlin scheme 2.0 2.0 2004 valuation deficit Amlin scheme 1.2 2002 valuation deficit Orphan scheme 6.8 2004 valuation deficit Orphan scheme 3.5 Ongoing funding 1.4 1.4 8.1 10.2 Group share of total charge 6.8 7.5 The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary.
Contributions are made at the funding rates recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period.
Amounts borne under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other Group companies.
However, actuarial amounts quoted below are for Syndicate 2001 as a whole, irrespective of capital provider, and other Group companies.
The latest actuarial assessment of the scheme, at 31 March 2004, used the projected unit actuarial method and was based on the following assumptions: 72 AMLIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 9 Pensions continued Long term annual rate Amlin Orphans section section %% Pre retirement Inflation 2.8 2.8 Investment return 6.3 5.9 Post retirement Inflation 3.0 3.0 Investment return 5.4 4.7 Increases to pensions in payment Limited price indexation 3.0 3.0 Limited price indexation minimum 3% 3.2 3.2 Discretionary increases 0.0 0.0 General pay escalation 4.5 4.5 Investment strategy Equities 50% 20% Bonds 50% 80% The assessment showed that the assets relating to the Amlin section of the Fund were 107.2 million, being 6.2 million less than the amount required to fund members accrued liabilities on the assumptions adopted, resulting in a shortfall of 6%.
To rectify this shortfall, Amlin has agreed with the Trustees that it will make six annual payments to the Fund of 1.2 million, with the first paid in December 2004 and subsequent payments falling due each 31 March, commencing on 31 March 2005.
In addition, Amlin has agreed to pay contributions to the notional orphans section to rectify a share of the funding shortfall revealed in the actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004 of 17 million based on the assumptions described above.
The assets notionally allocated to this section of 181 million were 91% of the amount expected to be required to provide the benefits of this section.
The Group and Syndicates share of this shortfall is currently estimated to be 11.4 million and 12.8 million respectively.
On 31 December 2004, a payment of 3.5 million was made in order to reduce this deficit.
Three subsequent annual payments of 3.5 million are falling due each 31 March, commencing on 31 March 2005.
Contributions will also be paid to provide for the cost of benefit accrual after the date of the valuation.
The rate of contribution agreed with the Trustees is 30% paid by the employer plus 5% member contributions, in each case of pensionable earnings.
These contributions will be backdated to take effect from 1 April 2004.
In 2004, funding rates and charges to the profit and loss account were at 30.2% of pensionable salaries as recommended by the 2001 valuation, and totalled 1.4 million 2003: 1.4 million.
b The Angerstein Underwriting Ltd funded defined benefit scheme SSAP 24 disclosures The scheme consists of a closed funded defined benefit scheme for certain past employees of a subsidiary of the Company, Angerstein Underwriting Limited.
Contributions to the scheme are determined by an independent qualified actuary, based upon triennial valuations, using the attained age actuarial method.
A valuation at 1 July 2004 was carried out, and the market value of the scheme assets was 1.2 million representing 59% of the benefits accrued to the members.
Group contributions made to this scheme in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004 were 0.1 million 2003: 0.1 million, and the agreed contribution rate for future years is an employer contribution of 31% plus 5% member contributions, in each case of pensionable salaries.
An accrual of 0.5 million was made at 31 December 2003 and 31 December 2004 to rectify the deficit of 0.8 million at the end of 2004.
A 2% per annum differential between investment returns and salary increases is assumed.
FRS 17 disclosures Angerstein Underwriting Ltd funded defined benefit scheme For the purposes of the FRS 17 disclosures, the 1 July 2004 valuation has been reviewed and updated to 31 December 2004.
The disclosures are based upon the following annual financial assumptions: AMLIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 73 9 Pensions continued 2004 2003 % % Inflation 2.9 2.8 Increase in salaries 4.9 4.8 Increase in pensions in payment 2.8 2.7 Increase in pensions in deferment 2.9 2.8 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.3 5.4 Return on equities 6.5 6.8 Under these assumptions the valuation of the scheme at 31 December would have been: 2004 2003 m m Assets Equities 1.3 1.1 Liabilities Present value of scheme liabilities 2.8 2.3 Scheme deficit 1.5 1.2 Scheme deficit attributable to the Group 1.5 1.2 Related deferred tax asset 0.5 0.4 Net scheme deficit 1.0 0.8 The members of the scheme are, or were, employed for the benefit of Syndicate 2001 or its predecessors.
Due to the varying ownership of capacity for the years of account to which the contributions are charged, the following amounts which would have been recognised in the performance statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 under FRS 17, are shown on the assumption that any charges would be taken to the 2004 year of account, when Amlin owns all of the capacity and therefore would receive all charges Amlins share of the 2003 year of account was 86.18%.

Contributions made by the Group varied by age, seniority and the level of contribution that employees voluntarily made to the scheme.
Employer contributions ranged from 4% to 21% and were fully expensed to the profit and loss account when due and payable.
With effect from 1 September 2004, the scheme was replaced with a new stakeholder scheme see d below.
Contributions to the old scheme ceased with effect from 31 August 2004 and the Lloyds Superannuation Fund decided to wind up the scheme and secure pension rights via a transfer to Section 32A policies with Merrill Lynch Investment Management, which was the investment manager for the AGMPS.
All staff members of the scheme have been given the option to retain benefits with Merrill Lynch or alternatively transfer their fund value to another approved arrangement, which includes the Amlin Retirement Investment Scheme ARIS.
d The stakeholder defined contribution scheme With effect from 1 September 2004 ARIS replaced the AGMPS.
The ARIS is a stakeholder arrangement, which provides staff with greater choice and flexibility on contributions and investments, improved security of benefits, better information and administrative support, and improved portability.
The employer contributions paid by Amlin have not changed as a result of these new arrangements, nor has the level of lump sum life assurance benefits.
Winterthur Life has been chosen as the stakeholder provider, following a rigorous selection process and review of the stakeholder market.
The total contributions for the year ended 31 December 2004 to the AGMPS and ARIS schemes are shown in the table on page 71. e Other arrangements Other pension arrangements include an occupational money purchase scheme which provides Death In Service protection for all employees.
Regular contributions, expressed as a percentage of employees earnings, are paid into this scheme and are allocated to accounts in the names of the individual members, which are independent of the Groups finances.
The contributions are charged against profits in the period in which they are payable.
There were no outstanding contributions at 31 December 2004 2003: nil.

Corporation tax is charged in the period in which the underwriting profits are actually paid by the syndicate to the corporate names.
Payment of the underwriting profit normally occurs in the fourth year after the commencement of a year of account.
Deferred tax is provided on the annually accounted technical result with reference to the forecast ultimate result of each of the years of account included in the annually accounted technical result.
Where the forecast ultimate result for a year of account is a taxable profit, deferred tax is provided in full on the movement on that year of account included in this periods annually accounted technical result.
Where the forecast ultimate result for a year of account is a loss, deferred tax is only provided for on the movement on that year of account included in this periods annually accounted technical result to the extent that forecasts show that the taxable loss will be utilised in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax has been provided on the annually accounted technical result for this accounting period of 108 million 2003: 110.3 million.
Deferred tax assets on non-aligned technical loss provisions are only provided for to the extent that forecasts show that it is more likely than not that the ultimate taxable underwriting losses represented by these provisions will be utilised within the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax has been provided in full on non-aligned loss provisions of 4.2 million 2003: 3.0 million.
76 AMLIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 11 Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued The Inland Revenue has introduced final regulations to give effect to the General Insurance Reserves provisions contained in the Finance Act 2000.
The Groups Lloyds corporate members fall within the remit of these regulations by virtue of their greater than 4% participation on aligned and non-aligned syndicates.
The corporation tax charge for this period contains an estimated adjustment in respect of a notional taxable charge as calculated under these regulations of 0.4 million 2003: 0.7 million.
A deferred tax asset of 2.1 million 2003: 1.1 million has been taken on existing capital losses to match against deferred tax provisions of 2.1 million 2003: 1.1 million on unrealised capital gains arising within the Group during this accounting period.
Deferred tax has not been provided on capital losses of 35.9 million 2003: 43.6 million.
The Group expects to continue to suffer depreciation in excess of capital allowances in future periods albeit at a diminishing rate.
The Group has suffered US tax on its share of syndicate US underwriting profits.
This US tax is recoverable against UK tax on the taxable syndicate profits for the appropriate years of account.
Some US tax suffered will be irrecoverable due to the difference between UK and US tax rates and the difference between the timing of US and UK syndicate profits for tax purposes.
During the period 0.4 million of US tax has been written off 2003: 1.4 million.

31 Contingent liabilities a Funds at Lloyds deeds of covenant and letters of credit The Group has entered into various deeds of covenant in respect of certain corporate member subsidiaries to meet each such subsidiarys obligations to Lloyds.
At 31 December 2004, the total guarantee given by the Group under these deeds of covenant subject to limited exceptions amounted to 252.2 million 2003: 209.5 million.
The obligations under the deeds of covenant are secured by a fixed charge of the same amount over investments, and a floating charge over the investments and other assets of the Group, in favour of Lloyds.
Lloyds has the right to retain the income on the charged investments, although it is not expected to exercise this right unless it considers there to be a risk that one or more of the covenants might need to be called and, if called, might not be honoured in full.
As liability under each deed of covenant is limited to a fixed monetary amount, the enforcement by Lloyds of any deed of covenant in the event of a default by a corporate member, where the total value of investments has fallen below the total of all amounts covenanted, may result in the appropriation of a share of the Groups Funds at Lloyds that is greater than the proportion which that subsidiarys overall premium limit bears to the total overall premium limit of the Group.
The Group has also entered into Lloyds deposit trust deeds for Funds at Lloyds by which letters of credit LOCs for a total amount of 130 million 2003: 130 million and US$90 million have been deposited.
The sterling LOCs were deposited at Lloyds in November 2003 pursuant to a bank LOC facility agreed in September 2003 which replaced the previous such facility.
US$90 million of dollar denominated LOCs, which were procured in 2001 by agreement with the Companys 9.8% shareholder State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Company, were released by Lloyds in November 2004. b Reinsurance to close RITC on spread portfolio RITC is a particular type of reinsurance contract entered into by Lloyds syndicates whereby the members of a syndicate for a particular year of account the closing year agree with the members of that or another syndicate for a later year of account the reinsuring members that the reinsuring members will indemnify, discharge or procure the discharge of all the known and unknown liabilities of the closing year arising out of insurance business underwritten by the syndicate in the closing year of account.
88 AMLIN PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2004 31 Contingent liabilities continued In the event that a corporate member resigns from a syndicate or reduces its participation relative to the other members of the syndicate, it will make a net payment of an RITC premium.
The payment of the RITC premium does not release members from ultimate responsibility for claims payable on risks they have written and in the event that the reinsuring members were unable to pay and the other elements in the Lloyds chain of security fail, the members would remain liable for the payment of any outstanding claims.
Payment of an RITC premium is conventionally treated as settling a members outstanding claims for the closing year and this convention has been adopted in these accounts.
There is no mechanism for the Group to account for the gross claims payments and recoveries made from the reinsuring members or to quantify the ongoing exposure in respect of closed years of account.
The directors consider that the possibility of the corporate members having to assume these liabilities is remote.
32 Related party transactions During the period under review Mr B D Carpenter, a director, was a member of Syndicate 2001, managed by the Group, as set out below.
Under the terms of an offer made in 2002 to all external members he exercised the right to participate in the 2003 year of account for 50% of his 2002 capacity and all profit commission payable to the Group was waived.
