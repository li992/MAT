At 31 March 2004, options over 2,873,248 ordinary shares were outstanding under Employee Share Option Plans.
This option is linked to a corresponding grant of options.
Accordingly the exercise of this option over a number of shares automatically causes its counterpart to lapse in respect of the same number of shares: therefore this option does not increase the total number of shares under option.
The total in the table reflects the number of shares under option.
At 31 March 2004 the British Land Share Ownership Plan, a discretionary trust established to facilitate the operation of the incentive schemes, held 3,076,894 ordinary shares, with a market value of 20,076,733, in respect of RSP restricted and LTIP performance shares 2003: 2,871,742, 11,795,680.
The amount of shares which eventually vest depends on actual performance against net asset value per share targets and a three year service period.
