BASIS OF PREPARATION, CONSOLIDATION AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation and consolidation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the UK and the Companies Act 1985.
These differ significantly to those in the US and a reconciliation to generally accepted accounting principles in the US US GAAP is provided in note 28.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all subsidiaries for the year ended 31 March 2004.
Where the financial statements of subsidiary undertakings do not conform with the Yell Groups accounting policies, appropriate adjustments are made on consolidation in order to present the Yell Group consolidated financial statements on a consistent basis.
All companies within the Yell Group during the period of ownership have coterminous financial years.
All transactions between the Yell Groups businesses have been eliminated in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements.
The results of companies and businesses acquired during the period are included in the consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.
Intra-group transactions which have been eliminated on consolidation of the Group have not been disclosed, as permitted by FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenditure during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Estimates are used principally when accounting for provision for doubtful debts, amortisation of goodwill, depreciation, employee pension and taxes.
Brief details of principal subsidiary undertakings at each year end, all of which are unlisted, are shown in note 12 to the financial statements.
Accounting policies a Turnover Group turnover, after deduction of sales allowances, value added tax and other sales taxes, comprises the value of products provided by Group undertakings.
Turnover from classified directories, Business Pages and other directories, mainly comprising advertising revenue, is recognised in the profit and loss account upon completion of delivery to the users of the directories.
Other turnover, principally from Yellow Pages 118 24 7 and Yell.
com, is recognised from the point at which service is first provided over the life of the contract.
b Cost of sales Cost of sales are the costs incurred in producing directories and other Group products, including costs of the sales force and certain sales overheads dedicated to the sale of advertising.
Charges for doubtful debts are also included within cost of sales and are charged to the profit and loss account as a percentage of turnover based upon the actual bad debt experience as a proportion of total billings.
c Advertising The Group expenses the costs of advertising its own products and services as the costs are incurred.
d Interest Interest payable is charged as incurred on an accruals basis.
e Foreign currencies On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
The results of foreign undertakings are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange for the period.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation at period-end exchange rates of the net investment in foreign undertakings, less exchange differences on borrowings that finance or provide a hedge against those undertakings, are taken through the statement of total recognised gains and losses to reserves and are also disclosed in note 20.
All other exchange gains or losses are dealt with through the profit and loss account.
58 Yell Group plc f Intangible fixed assets Goodwill arising from the purchase of subsidiary undertakings represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is amortised on a straight-line basis from the time of the acquisition over its estimated useful economic life.
Estimated useful life is determined after taking into account such factors as the nature and age of the business, as well as the typical life span of the acquired products to which the goodwill attaches.
Goodwill in respect of all acquired businesses is amortised over 20 years.
g Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less depreciation.
Cost comprises the purchase price and any other costs of bringing an asset into use.
Depreciation is provided on tangible fixed assets on a straight-line basis from the time they are available for use, so as to write off their costs over their estimated useful economic lives taking into account any expected residual values.
The lives assigned to tangible fixed assets range from two to six years.
h Asset impairment Intangible and tangible fixed assets are tested for impairment when an event that might affect asset values has occurred.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount cannot be recovered either by selling the asset or by the discounted future earnings from operating the assets.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and at any other time when the directors believe that an impairment may have occurred.
i Investments Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the financial statements of the Company are valued at least once every three years, but earlier if significant acquisitions have taken place.
A deficit on revaluation is charged to the profit and loss account to the extent that it is not covered by a surplus previously credited to the revaluation reserve.
Previously the fixed asset investment in subsidiary undertakings was stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
The directors of the Company believe that the change in accounting policy is in the best interest of the Company because the Company can reflect a fair value of its worth in its financial statements without reducing the working capital of subsidiary undertakings.
The effect of the change in accounting policy and the adjustments to the comparative figures are shown in notes 12 and 20. j Leased assets Rentals in respect of operating leases, under which substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership remain with the lessor, are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Assets held under finance leases where substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership are transferred to the Group are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and depreciated over their useful economic lives.
The capital element of the future obligations under the leases is included as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets, classified as appropriate as a creditor due within or after one year.
Lease payments are split between capital and interest elements using the annuity method and the interest is then charged to the profit and loss account.
k Stocks Stocks, representing directories in progress, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Directories in progress mainly comprise sales force costs, artwork and other directory production costs, including appropriate direct overheads, pending completion of delivery of the relevant directories.
Other stock represents paper stock held by the US business.
l Pension schemes The Group currently operates a defined benefit pension scheme for its UK employees employed before 1 October 2001 and operates defined contribution pension schemes for its UK employees employed subsequent to 1 October 2001 and its US employees.
All pension schemes are independent of the Groups finances.
Actuarial valuations of the defined benefit scheme are carried out as determined by the trustees at intervals of not more than three years, the rates of contribution payable and the pension cost being determined on the advice of the actuaries, having regard to the results of these valuations.
In any intervening 59 Annual Report 2003 04 years, the actuaries review the continuing appropriateness of the contribution rates.
The cost of providing pensions is charged against profits over employees working lives with the Group using the projected unit method.
Payments to the Groups defined contribution schemes are charged against profit as incurred.
The transitional arrangements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits have been applied in the preparation of these financial statements with the relevant disclosures shown in note 24. m Employee share schemes The cost of employee share options, except for options in Inland Revenue approved Sharesave schemes, is measured at the intrinsic value of the options granted on the date of grant and is charged to the profit and loss over the vesting period.
The Group takes advantage of available exemptions in respect of accounting for discounts arising on the grant of options in Inland Revenue approved Sharesave schemes.
When the ESOP trust acquires and holds shares of the Company, the Group presents them as a deduction in arriving at equity shareholders funds.
n Taxation The charge credit for taxation is based on the profit loss for the period and takes into account deferred taxation.
Provision is made in full for deferred tax liabilities that arise from timing differences where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely than not to be recoverable.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
o Financial instruments All borrowings are initially stated at the fair value of consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Issue costs are charged to the profit and loss account together with the coupon, as finance costs, on a constant-yield basis over the term of the borrowings, or over a shorter period where the lender can require earlier repayment.
The Group considers its derivative financial instruments to be hedges when certain criteria are met.
For interest rate derivatives, the instrument must be related to assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must also change the interest rate or the nature of the interest rate by converting a variable rate to a fixed rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under interest rate swap agreements are recognised by adjustment of interest payable.
See note 17 for further details on the Groups financial instruments.
p Dividends Dividends are recorded in the period in respect of which they are declared.
SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS The Group is a publisher of classified advertising directories in the UK and the US.
Turnover is principally derived from the sale of advertising in such publications.
The geographical analysis is stated on the basis of origin of operations, although it would not be different had it been stated on the basis of customer origin.
The segmental information is based on the segmental operating results regularly reviewed by the Groups chief operating decision maker the CEO.
The Groups operations are split geographically between the UK and the US and have been managed on this basis.
For the purposes of exercising day-to-day managerial and budgetary control, the UK management accounts are divided internally by product but these divisions are not self-standing businesses.
For the purpose of managing the UK business, most common costs are allocated entirely to classified directories.
Control is exercised by comparing performance against budgets that are agreed in advance.
The CEO reviews the turnover and Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation EBITDA before and after exceptional items within geographic segments.
EBITDA, before exceptional items, together with turnover, are key financial measures that we use to assess the success of our people in achieving growth in the business and operational efficiencies.
Segmental information is provided below in respect of UK and US businesses.

EARNINGS LOSS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share EPS is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares: those share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the ordinary shares during the year and the contingently issuable shares under the Groups long-term incentive plan.
At 31 March 2004, the performance criteria for the vesting of the awards under the incentive scheme had not been met and consequently the shares in question are excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.
Supplementary earnings per share to include pro forma interest adjustments net of tax, and exclude the exceptional IPO costs net of tax and goodwill amortisation are also shown: Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 m millions pence m millions pence Weighted Weighted average Per average Per number share number share a a Earnings of shares amount Earnings of shares amount Basic EPS 40.6 262 15.5 51.1 572 8.9 b Effect of interest adjustments net of tax 72.5 21.1 Exceptional costs and a non-recurring c restructuring charge net of tax 15.1 111.3 d Effect of goodwill amortisation 98.4 96.7 Effect of shares issued on IPO 433 123 Basic pro forma EPS excluding goodwill amortisation 145.4 695 20.9 178.0 695 25.6 Effect of dilutive securities options 9 0.3 9 0.3 Diluted pro forma EPS excluding goodwill amortisation 145.4 704 20.6 178.0 704 25.3 a The calculation of the basic and diluted earnings loss per ordinary share has been based on the profit loss for the relevant financial year and on 262 million shares for the year ended 31 March 2003, being the weighted average share capital prior to the initial public offering after taking account of the restructuring of the existing share capital conditional on the initial public offering.
For the year ended 31 March 2004, the calculation was based on 572 million shares, the weighted average share capital during the year, also taking account of the restructuring.
b Group losses have been adjusted to exclude interest charges on the long-term debt we repaid as a result of the initial public offering as if repaid on 31 March 2002.
Interest has been added back by referring to the effective interest rates applied to the borrowings repaid from the proceeds of the IPO over each respective period.
All interest adjustments have been tax effected at the UK corporation tax rate of 30%.
The weighted average number of shares has been adjusted as though the initial public offering had happened on 31 March 2002. c Exceptional costs are explained in Note 3. d Amortisation charges presented are not adjusted for tax.
If the tax effect from allowable amortisation in the US had been taken into account, then the adjustment would have been 86.4 million, as opposed to 96.7 million and 87.2 million, as opposed to 98.4 million, in 2004 and 2003, respectively.
Accordingly, the diluted earnings per share would have been 23.8 pence as opposed to 25.3 pence in the year ended 31 March 2004.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT Treasury policy The Groups treasury functions primary role is to fund investments and to manage liquidity and financial risk, including risk from volatility in currency and interest rates and counterparty credit risk.
The treasury function is not a profit centre and its objective is to manage risk at optimum cost.
The board of directors sets the treasury functions policy and its activities are subject to a set of controls commensurate with the magnitude of the investments and borrowings under its management.
Counterparty credit risk is closely monitored and managed within controls set by the board of directors.
Derivative financial instruments, including forward foreign exchange contracts, are used only for hedging purposes.
The principal financing and treasury exposures faced by the Group arise from working capital management, the financing of acquisitions and tangible fixed assets, the management of interest rate positions and the investment of surplus cash.
The treasury function manages those exposures with the objective of remaining within ratios covenanted with the senior lenders.
The Group has not purchased or issued any derivative contracts for trading or hedging purposes, except as referred to below.
Up until the initial public offering on 15 July 2003, the Yell Group financed its operations primarily by long-term debt.
Details of the Groups borrowings are disclosed in note 16.
Subsequent to the initial public offering, the Yell Group funds the business largely from cash flows generated from operations.
All significant cash inflows and outflows associated with the Groups operations in the UK are denominated in pounds sterling, and all significant cash inflows and outflows associated with operations in the US are denominated in dollars.
However, the financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, and changes in the exchange rate between the dollar and pounds sterling will affect the translation of the results of our operations in the US into pounds sterling.
The Group does not intend to hedge any foreign exchange rate risk relating to US dollar-denominated notes, although we will continue to review this practice.
The dilution of the Groups earnings reported in pounds sterling as a result of the weakening US dollar is partially offset by natural hedging from debt denominated in US dollars.
The Group borrows at both fixed and floating rates of interest and, in order to achieve the objective of managing interest rate risk, partially hedges its risks through the use of interest-rate derivative instruments.
Interest is payable under the senior credit facilities at a variable interest rate.
Under our previous senior credit facilities, we were required to hedge at least 50% of the variable rate indebtedness for a duration of at least two years.
Under our new senior facilities agreement we are required to have fixed interest on at least 50% of all interest payments during the 21 months following each month end.
This requirement ceases once the Group leverage ratio falls below 3.5 times.
We have fixed interest on at least 50% of the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to March 2006, with a review of this strategy on a quarterly basis.
During the year ended 31 March 2004, as set out in note 22, net debt decreased from 2,368.7 million to 1,223.0 million, primarily as a result of financings and their associated costs, foreign currency movements in the period and repaying borrowings on the initial public offering.
71 Annual Report 2003 04 Other financial instruments The Group also has short-term debtors and creditors that arise in the normal course of business and, therefore, have been excluded from the disclosures which follow.
There has been no change in the role that financial instruments have in creating or changing the Groups risk between 31 March 2004 and the date of these financial statements.

See further detail in note 16.
Details of currency denomination, interest and maturity profiles of specific borrowings are given in note 16.
There are no material monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies other than local reporting currencies.
Interest rate profile Details of year-end interest rates on borrowings are set out in note 16.
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps for the purpose of hedging future floating interest rate movements.
The Group has fixed interest rates on at least 50% of the interest rate exposure on the indebtedness under the senior credit facilities using interest rate swaps over the period to March 2006.
For the fixed-rate financial liabilities, the average interest rates and the average periods for which the rates are fixed are: At 31 March 2003 At 31 March 2004 Weighted Weighted average average Weighted period Weighted period average for which average for which interest rate is interest rate is rate fixed rate fixed % Years % Years Currency: Sterling 9.2 9.1 7.1 3.0 US dollar 9.8 4.9 8.5 4.2 Total borrowings 9.3 8.2 7.3 3.4 The floating rate financial liabilities bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods ranging, at the Groups option, from one month to six months by reference to LIBOR.
The Group expects to continue to fix its floating rate financial liabilities at the end of each month by reference to one month LIBOR at that time.
72 Yell Group plc Borrowing facilities and liquidity risk The Group has maintained committed banking facilities to mitigate any liquidity risk it may face.
There were committed senior debt facilities at 31 March 2004 of 200.0 million 2003100.0 million of which 5.0 million had been drawn down at 31 March 2004 2003nil.
These facilities expire on 7 July 2008.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The following table reflects the carrying amount and fair value of the Groups financial instruments at 31 March 2003 and 2004.
The fair values of the financial instruments are the amounts at which the instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties, other than in forced liquidation or sale.

PENSIONS SSAP 24Accounting for Pension Costs Pension costs in respect of the Yell Pension Plan YPP and the defined contribution schemes were: Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 m m Amounts expensed for YPP defined benefit section 8.0 8.3 Amounts expensed for defined contribution schemes 1.9 2.4 Total 9.9 10.7 80 Yell Group plc Yell Pension Plan YPP Defined benefit section With effect from 1 October 2001, a defined contribution section was established in the YPP and the defined benefit sections were closed to new entrants.
The pension cost for the year ended 31 March 2004 was based on the valuation at 5 April 2002.
The valuation, carried out by professionally qualified independent actuaries, used the projected unit method in conjunction with a market value of assets.
The principal assumptions used and the results of the valuation are set out below: 5 April 2002 Rates per annum % Valuation method Projected unit Return on existing and future assets 6.0 to 6.5 Average increase in retail price index 2.7 Average future increases in wages and salaries 4.2 Average increase in pensions 2.7 Dividend growth At 5 April 2002 the last valuation date the market value of assets was 102.7 million.
The results of the valuation show that the assets of the scheme were sufficient to cover 102% of the benefits that had accrued to members by that date after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The date for the next valuation is expected to be no later than 5 April 2005.
For the year ended 31 March 2004, the Group made regular contributions totalling 8.5 million to the defined benefit section 20037.9 million.
In addition, a contribution of 0.9 million 20030.1 million in respect of benefit improvements was made, of which 0.8 million was accrued in the 2003 financial year.
There are no provisions held on the balance sheet in respect of this plan at 31 March 2004.
The Group has a prepayment of 0.3 million at 31 March 2004 2003nil.
The funding policy differs from the accounting policy primarily in that for funding purposes the Company contributes to target a funding level of 105% in the above assumptions.
The YPP assets are invested in UK and overseas equities, fixed interest and index linked securities, deposits and short-term investments.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
Defined contribution schemes In addition to the defined contribution section Four of the YPP, Yellow Book sponsor a 401 k plan for the majority of Yellow Book employees in the US.
The plan allows employees to contribute a portion of their pre-tax and or after-tax income in accordance with specified guidelines.
Yellow Book matches a percentage of the employee contributions up to certain limits.
The assets of the plan are held separately from those of Yellow Book in an independently administered fund.
The pension cost in respect of these schemes represents contributions payable to the funds and amounted to 2.4 million in the year ended 31 March 2004 20031.9 million.
Outstanding contributions amounted to nil million as at 31 March 2004 20030.3 million.
These are included in other creditorsplease see note 18.
FRS 17 Retirement benefits A valuation of the YPP for the purposes of FRS 17 was carried out at 31 March 2002 and updated to 31 March 2003 and 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.

Improvements in benefits costing 0.8 million were made in the year ended 31 March 2004 and contributions of 8.5 million 13.05% of pensionable earnings, plus an additional contribution of 0.8 million in respect of a benefit improvement was made.
In addition a contribution of 0.1 million in respect of benefit improvements made in the previous year was made on 1 April 2003.
In the year ended 31 March 2004, the Group made contributions at an average rate of 13.05% of pensionable earnings inclusive of expenses and life assurance premiums.
The Groups trustees have agreed that contributions for the next two years will continue at the same rate, with an evaluation future contribution rates after the next full valuation.

US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The Groups consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain respects from those applicable in the US US GAAP.
US GAAP information is provided because US employees have been granted share options.
I Differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles The following are the main differences between UK and US GAAP which are relevant to the Groups financial statements.
a Directories in progress Under UK GAAP, the cost of directories in progress deferred in stock represents direct fixed and variable costs as well as directly attributable overhead costs.
Under US GAAP, the deferred costs associated with directories in progress would only comprise the direct production costs and the incremental direct costs associated with selling and creating the directories.
Directories in progress acquired in a business purchase are valued at replacement value under UK GAAP and at fair value under US GAAP.
Under UK GAAP this difference is included in goodwill.
Under US GAAP, the fair value is charged to the profit and loss upon delivery of the related directories.
b Pensions Under both UK and US GAAP, pension costs are charged against profits over employees working lives.
Differences between the UK and US GAAP figures arise from the requirement to use different actuarial methods and assumptions and a different method of amortising surpluses or deficits, when accounting for a single employer scheme.
c Goodwill and other intangibles Under UK GAAP the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the fair market value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets, with the excess recorded as goodwill with an estimated economic life of 20 years.
Goodwill is not amortised under US GAAP and is subject to an annual impairment test.
The Yell Group completed its impairment tests of goodwill as of 31 March 2003 and 2004 and determined that goodwill balances were not impaired.
Under US GAAP the purchase price of acquisitions is allocated to the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible assets, including acquired customer relationships that are amortised over eight to nine years and brand names that are amortised over forty years.
The aggregate amortisation expense for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 2004 and the estimated aggregate amortisation expense for the succeeding five years, assuming a constant US dollar exchange rate, are as follows: m Aggregate amortisation expense For year ended 31 March 2003 106.7 For year ended 31 March 2004 86.5 Estimated amortisation expense For year ending 31 March 2005 74.5 For year ending 31 March 2006 60.6 For year ending 31 March 2007 49.9 For year ending 31 March 2008 41.7 For year ending 31 March 2009 35.9 87 Annual Report 2003 04 Goodwill The changes in the net book value of goodwill for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004 are as follows: UK US Yell Group m m m Balance as of 1 April 2002 599.4 354.4 953.8 Goodwill acquired during year 299.7 299.7 Reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets acquired 17.2 17.2 Currency movements 58.9 58.9 Balance as of 31 March 2003 599.4 578.0 1,177.4 Goodwill acquired during year 76.1 76.1 Reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets acquired 8.2 8.2 a Fair value adjustments 3.3 3.3 Currency movements 85.6 85.6 Balance as of 31 March 2004 599.4 563.6 1,163.0 a The fair value adjustment to goodwill was due to the nalisation of transaction costs in respect of acquisitions in prior years.
Intangible assets under US GAAP comprise: At 31 March 2003 2004 m m Gross book value Acquired customer relationships 493.4 498.1 Brand names 535.0 511.6 Additional minimum liability 0.3 1.1 Goodwill net of amortisation to 31 March 2002 1,177.4 1,163.0 2,206.1 2,173.8 Accumulated amortisation Acquired customer relationships 161.1 224.6 Brand names 25.6 39.6 Total accumulated amortisation under US GAAP 186.7 264.2 Net book value in accordance with US GAAP 2,019.4 1,909.6 Net book value in accordance with UK GAAP 1,824.1 1,725.3 Estimated UK to US GAAP adjustments 195.3 184.3 Included in goodwill is 344.9 million of unamortised goodwill relating to purchases made after 1 April 2002.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the remaining 3.1 million asset relating to the Planet Pages brand name was written off as this name, which was acquired in connection with the McLeod business, is no longer used.
Additionally, under US GAAP, the difference between the retail value and net replacement value of directories in progress is included in directories in progress and charged against profits when the directories are delivered.
Under UK GAAP the difference is included in goodwill.
d Derivative financial instruments Certain financial risks are managed through the use of financial instruments, mainly interest rate swaps collars.
These contracts provide economic hedging to the Company: however, they do not qualify as hedges for US GAAP accounting purposes under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities SFAS 133, as amended and interpreted.
Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
Therefore, unrealised gains losses must be recorded in the profit and loss account at each reporting date.
For the interest rate derivative contracts, a gain of 21.7 million would have been recorded for the year ended 31 March 2004 2003loss of 13.6 million under US GAAP, within interest expense.
The liability at 31 March 2004 would have been 3.2 million 2003liability of 24.9 million.
These movements reflect the fluctuations in the fair value of the US dollar and pounds sterling floating interest rate swaps since the contracts were agreed, and the unwinding of losses previously recognised under US GAAP which have now been recorded as interest expense under UK GAAP.
88 Yell Group plc e Employee option plans Under UK GAAP, compensation expense on awards of stock options and other share-based compensation is measured based on the intrinsic value of the awards, if any, at the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, compensation expense is measured based on the fair value of the awards at the date of grant.
The fair value of each option grant during the year ended 31 March 2003 and the period from 1 April 2003 through June 2003 was estimated at the date of grant using the minimumvalue method.
The fair value of each option grant subsequent to June 2003 was estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation method.
The Group used the following weighted-average assumptions in its estimations of fair value: Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 Risk free interest rate 4.3% 4.4% Expected dividend yield 0% 3% Expected volatility 0% 35% Expected life of option 5.0 years 3.7 years f Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in respect of which they are declared.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which dividends are declared.
g Deferred taxation The reconciling adjustment for deferred taxation comprises the tax effects arising from the other UK to US GAAP adjustments listed in the reconciliation below, together with the effect of an adjustment of 8.2 million 200317.2 million to reverse tax benefits associated with the reversal of a valuation allowance recorded on purchase which under US GAAP results in a reduction to goodwill.
At 31 March 2004, the adjustment to decrease shareholders funds deficit of 182.9 million 2003223.9 million decrease included the tax effect of other US GAAP adjustments.
This comprised an adjustment increasing current deferred tax assets by 35.7 million 200321.1 million increasing non-current deferred tax assets by nil million at 31 March 2004 200314.0 million which were net of a 7.7 million 200354.6 million, valuation allowance for deferred tax assets arising from operations in the US, and 218.6 million 2003259.0 million of non-current deferred tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets arising from operations in the UK are considered to be recoverable for all years presented.
h Gross profit under US GAAP presentation Additionally, under UK GAAP, doubtful debt expenses are included in cost of sales.
Under US GAAP, these expenses do not meet the criteria to be classified as cost of sales and thus would be included in administrative costs.
Additionally, distribution costs would be in cost of sales under US GAAP.
89 Annual Report 2003 04 II Net loss and shareholders deficit funds reconciliation statements The following statements summarise estimated adjustments, gross of their tax effect, which reconcile loss and shareholders deficit funds from that reported under UK GAAP to that which would have been reported had US GAAP been applied.

IV Pensions The following position for the YPP is computed in accordance with US GAAP pension accounting rules under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87, the effect of which is shown in the above reconciliation statements.
The components of the pension cost for the YPP comprised: Year ended 31 March 2003 2004 m m Service cost 9.1 12.6 Interest cost 6.6 8.0 Expected return on scheme assets 7.9 6.5 Amortisation of net obligation at date of limited application of SFAS 87 3.1 Recognised losses 0.1 YPP pension cost for the year under US GAAP 7.9 17.2 The information required to be disclosed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No 132, revised 2003, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefitsan amendment of FASB Statements No 87, 88 and 106 SFAS 132R concerning the funded status of the YPP at and for the years ended 31 March 2003 and 2004, based on the valuation at 5 April 2002, is as follows: At and for the year ended 31 March 2003 2004 m m Changes in benefit obligation Present value of scheme liabilities at the beginning of the year 109.6 147.9 Service cost 9.2 12.6 Interest cost 6.6 8.0 Employees contributions 3.6 3.7 Actuarial movement 19.6 24.6 Benefits paid or payable 1.0 2.7 Plan amendments 0.3 0.8 Benefit obligation at the end of the year 147.9 194.9 91 Annual Report 2003 04 At 31 March 2003 2004 m Amounts recognised in the statement of financial position consist of: Accrued pension costs 28.1 37.9 Intangible asset 0.3 1.1 Charge to equity 35.5 36.8 Net prepaid pension costs recognised 7.7 The accumulated benefit obligation of 160.3 million at 31 March 2004 2003122.2 million was calculated on the assumption that pension increases start immediately.
At 31 March 2003 2004 m m Changes in scheme assets Market value of scheme assets at the beginning of the year 103.0 94.1 Actual return on scheme assets 19.5 17.8 Employers contributions 8.0 9.5 Employees contributions 3.6 3.7 Benefits paid or payable 1.0 2.7 Market value of assets at the end of the year 94.1 122.4 At 31 March 2003 2004 m m Funded status under US GAAP Projected benefit obligation in excess of scheme assets 53.8 72.6 Unrecognised prior service costs a 0.3 1.1 Other unrecognised net actuarial losses 61.2 71.5 Prepaid pension costs under US GAAP 7.7 a The unrecognised prior service costs are amortised over 15 years.
The benefit obligation for the main pension scheme was determined using the following assumptions at 1 April 2003 and 1 April 2004: Rates per annum % 2003 2004 Discount rate 5.40 5.40 Rate of future pay increases 4.00 4.40 Pension increases 2.50 2.90 Expected return on assets 6.50 6.35 The assets in the YPP and the annual expected rates of return on these assets are shown in note 24 to the financial statements.
For US GAAP purposes, multi-employer accounting was applied in respect of past participation in the BTPS for the period until 1 November 2001.
Accordingly, the annual pension expense in respect of the BTPS is equal to the annual employer contributions, as is the case under UK GAAP.
Beginning 1 November 2001, the date of the transaction, the participants in the BTPS became participants of YPP, which is a single employer scheme.
The SFAS 87 disclosures above for the periods after 1 November 2001 reflect the additional participants as a result of the transaction.
