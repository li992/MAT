Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable Accounting Standards.
The particular policies are described below: Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified to include the revaluation of fixed asset investments and investment properties.
"The Statement of Recommended Practice ""SORP"" for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies 2003 has been adopted, except in relation to accounting for Index Stock and the related interest as outlined below."
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings for the financial year ended 30 September 2004.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Investment income Dividend income is recognised in the revenue account when declared 'ex-dividend' as appropriate.
In accordance with FRS16, dividend income is now shown excluding any associated tax credit with a consequent reduction in the amount of the tax charges.
Income from fixed interest securities is dealt with on an accruals basis.
Enhanced scrip dividend income is accounted for by recognising the 'cash' element in the revenue account and the 'bonus' element in the capital reserve account.
Investments UK listed investments have been valued at middle-market quotations ruling at the close of business on 30 September 2004 and foreign listed investments have been valued at market prices and exchange rates at the same date.
Unlisted investments and investments in subsidiaries have been included at Directors' valuation.
Any profits or losses arising from the disposal of investments are taken directly to capital reserves.
Investments held by the dealing subsidiary undertakings are stated at the lower of cost and market value.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of settlement of the transaction.
Foreign currency balances, including investments denominated in foreign currencies, are translated into sterling at the rate of exchange prevailing at the year end.
Profits or losses on retranslation of investments at the year end are included within unrealised appreciation depreciation of investments and are taken to capital reserves.
Expenses All expenses are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are charged through the revenue account except as follows: - the base management fee at the rate of 0.25% or at the rate of 0.30% if the Company outperforms its benchmark index, or underperforms by no more than 5%.
A base management fee of 0.30% is attributable to revenue reserve.
- the performance element of management costs.
The allocation of the management fee between revenue and capital is in line with the Boards expected long term split of returns and capital.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
This is subject to deferred tax assets only being recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Timing differences are differences between the Companys taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements which are capable of reversal in one or more subsequent periods.
Deferred tax is measured without discounting on the basis of enacted tax rates.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings The Company's investment in its subsidiaries is carried in the Company's accounts at net asset value attributable to equity Shareholders in the subsidiary undertakings.
33 British Empire Securities and General Trust p. l. c. Notes to the Accounts continued Capital reserves Capital reserves - realised The following are accounted for in this reserve: -gains and losses on the realisation of investments: - realised exchange differences of a capital nature: - the 'bonus' element of enhanced scrip dividends: - base management fee at the rate of 0.25% or at the rate of 0.30% if the Company outperforms its benchmark index, or under - performs by no more than 5%.
Base management fee of 0.30% is attributable to revenue reserve: - the performance fee is charged wholly to capital reserve, since it derives from the capital performance of the Group relative to the benchmark index.
Capital reserves - unrealised The following are accounted for in this reserve: - increases and decreases in the valuation of investments held at the year end: - unrealised exchange differences of a capital nature: - increases and decreases in the valuation of the Index Stock.
Index Stock The Index Stock is valued at the capital value determined by reference to the level of the FTSE All-Share Index at the close of business on the relevant day.
Any difference between the nominal value and capital value is reflected through capital reserves.
Interest paid on the Index Stock is charged to revenue.
This does not comply with the Statement of Recommended Practice for Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies, which would require the finance costs of the Index Stock to be allocated between revenue and capital in line with the Board's expected long term split of returns and capital.
However, the Directors consider that the treatment adopted, which is consistent with previous years, is the most appropriate given the nature of the Index Stock.

Any out-performance in excess of the cap or under-performance in any year will be carried forward for use in the next three years fee calculations on a first-in first-out basis.
Details of the management agreement and fees are contained in the Report of the Directors.

It is unlikely that the Company will generate sufficient taxable profits in the future to utilise these expenses and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised.

Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise equity and fixed interest investments, cash balances and borrowings.
As an investment trust the Group holds a portfolio of financial assets in pursuit of its investment objective.
The Group makes use of borrowings to achieve improved performance in rising markets.
The risk of borrowings may be reduced by raising the level of cash balances or fixed interest investments held.
Investments held see note 8 are valued at middle market prices which equate to their fair values.
The market value of the Groups Debenture Stocks is disclosed in note 14.
The fair value of all other financial assets and liabilities is represented by their carrying value in the Balance Sheet.
Short term debtors and creditors are excluded from disclosure as allowed by FRS 13, other than for currency disclosures.
Market price risk The management of market price risk is part of the fund management process and is typical of equity investment.
The portfolio is managed with an awareness of the effects of adverse price movements through detailed and continuing analysis with the objective of maximising overall returns to shareholders.
Further information on the investment portfolio is set out on pages 18 to 20.
The Group has not used derivatives to date as part of its investment strategy but reserves the right to do so in the future.
Interest rate and liquidity risk When the Group retains cash balances the majority of the cash is held in deposit accounts.
The benchmark rate which determines the interest payments received on such cash balances held in sterling was 4.58% at the balance sheet date 2003: sterling and foreign currencies 3.75%.
2004 2003 '000 '000 The Group had the following floating rate liability: Equities Index Unsecured Loan Stock 2013 Index Stock 6,955 6,506 The interest and capital liabilities of the Index Stock move in accordance with movements in the income and capital returns of the FTSE All-Share Index.
This exposure may be reduced by investing in fixed assets expected to perform in line with FTSE AllShare Index.
Fixed rate The Group holds fixed interest and index-linked investments and has fixed interest liabilities.
At 30 September 2004, these were: 2004 2004 2003 2003 Average Average Average Average interest period interest period 2004 rate until 2003 rate until Fixed interest investments: 000 % maturity 000 % maturity UK Treasury 6.75% 2004 and 5% 2004 --- 34,437 5.19 0.8 years UK Treasury 6.75% 2004, 8.5% 2005, 2% Index-linked 2006 and Impax Group 5.5% 2009 53,794 7.45 0.9 years --- Fixed interest liabilities: 3 1 10 8 and 8 8 per cent Debenture Stocks 2011 and 2023 23,379 8.94 14 years 26,740 9.10 14 years The Group is potentially exposed to payment of a penalty in the event that the Debenture Stock is repaid before maturity see page 21.
In respect of liquidity risk, the Groups assets comprise mainly realisable securities.
Short term flexibility is achieved by retaining cash and, where necessary, through the use of overdraft facilities.
45 British Empire Securities and General Trust p. l. c. Notes to the Accounts continued 25.
Foreign currency risk The Group invests in overseas securities and holds foreign currency cash balances which gives rise to currency risks.
It is not the Groups policy to hedge this risk but it reserves the right to do so in the future.
