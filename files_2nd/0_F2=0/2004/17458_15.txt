Xansa Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of Xansa plc and all its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 April each year.
Subsidiary undertakings are included in the Group accounts using the acquisition method of accounting.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 May 1998 has been capitalised and amortised over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising prior to 1 May 1998 remains written off to the profit and loss account reserve as permitted by FRS 10.
On disposal or closure of a previously acquired business, the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
Investment in subsidiary undertakings In the Company balance sheet the investment in subsidiary undertakings is stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Employee share ownership trusts The assets, liabilities and results of the Groups employee trusts are recognised in the accounts of the Company in accordance with the requirements of UITF abstract 13 and UITF abstract 32.
52 Investment in own shares Own shares are valued at cost less provisions for any permanent diminution in value.
The cost of shares held within the All Employee Share Ownership Plan that have been gifted to employees is amortised over the period during which the shares vest.
Depreciation Depreciation has been provided at the following annual rates on the cost less estimated residual value of the assets concerned: Fixtures, fittings and equipment 10%20% Electronic equipment and related purchased software 25%33% Motor vehicles 25% Long leasehold land and buildings 2% Premiums paid on, and additions to, short leasehold property are amortised over the shorter of the period until the next rent review or the useful life of the lease.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Contracts in progress Profits on time and material contracts are recognised in line with the effort expended.
Profits on fixed price contracts are taken in proportion to the cost of work performed on each contract relative to the estimated total cost of completing the contract.
Provision is made for the whole of any anticipated contract losses as soon as they are identified.
Pre-contract costs Directly attributable pre-contract costs incurred after it is virtually certain that the contract will be obtained are carried forward, to be amortised over the life of the contract.
Turnover Turnover comprises the total value of fees and expenses due from external customers after deducting all credits and allowances and excluding value added tax.
Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the accounts that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the accounts.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being recognised only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries only to the extent that, at the balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has been entered into by the subsidiary.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Foreign currencies Foreign currency assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates prevailing at that date.
Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are accounted for at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Trading results of foreign subsidiary undertakings are included in the Groups results using year end rates.
Gains and losses arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in foreign subsidiary undertakings and the results of foreign subsidiary undertakings at the year end rate are taken directly to reserves.
All other foreign exchange gains and losses are reflected in the profit and loss account.
Xansa Report & Accounts 2004 1 Accounting policies continued The rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date were: 2004 2003 sterling sterling Indian rupee 79.56 75.67 US dollar 1.77 1.60 Euro 1.48 1.43 Malaysian ringgit 6.74 6.07 Singapore dollar 3.02 2.84 Finance and operating leases Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated in line with accounting policy.
The outstanding capital element of the related obligations is included in creditors.
The interest element is charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the lease.
Rentals in respect of all other leasing arrangements are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Pensions The Group operates a defined benefit pension scheme, with both a contributory and non-contributory element.
The scheme closed to new members in 2002, apart from individuals who join Xansa under Transfer of Undertaking Protection of Employment regulations.
In accordance with the flexible benefits programme, 5% of members salaries is allocated to individual flex funds to meet their pension obligations.
For members who qualify for enhanced benefits under the senior executive arrangements the allocation is 10%.
Contributions to this scheme are charged in the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the employees working lives.
The regular cost is attributed to individual years using the projected unit credit method.
Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees.
Differences between the amounts funded and the amounts charged in the profit and loss account are treated as either provisions or prepayments in the balance sheet.
In addition the Group operates money purchase pension schemes for those employees who wish to participate.
Contributions are paid to the schemes so as to secure the benefits set out in the rules.
2 Segmental analysis The Directors consider that the Group operates in one continuing class of business namely that of computer software and related support services.

The Plan closed to new members in 2002, apart from individuals who join Xansa under Transfer of Undertaking Protection of Employment regulations.
The Plan is funded by payments of contributions to a separately administered fund.
The last triennial valuation of the Xansa Pension Plan was performed as at 31 December 2003, by professionally qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries were that, over the long-term, the return on the Plans assets would be 7.5% 2000: 6.5% per annum and that salaries would increase at an average of 3.9% 2000: 5.0% per annum.
Allowances have been made for post-retirement pension increases guaranteed under the Plan rules.
The actuarial value of the assets was 82% of the liabilities using the assumptions outlined above 2000: 86%.
The market value of the schemes assets was 146.8 million.
Allowing for the above mentioned salary increases, the actuarial unfunded liability disclosed at the valuation date was 32.1 million 2000: 11.4 million.
The contribution rate for the year to 30 April 2005 has been set at 20.65% of pensionable earnings, which includes 3.25% to recover the actuarial unfunded liability over the average remaining service lives of the employees.
The pension cost for the year to 30 April 2004 was 18.6 million 2003: 16.2 million.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes in the UK.
The main scheme is called the Xansa Money 68 Purchase Pension Scheme and is open to all employees who are not members of the Xansa Pension Plan.
The Group also continues to operate defined contribution schemes which were operated by Druid Group plc and OSI Group Holdings Ltd prior to their joining the Group.
These schemes are closed to new members.
Contributions payable in respect of the period were 4.1 million 2003: 5.6 million.
Outside the UK employees are provided with pension arrangements determined in accordance with approved local practice and regulations and are defined contribution schemes.
Total contributions in respect of these schemes amounted to 0.7 million 2003: 0.9 million.
As at 30 April 2004 the amount outstanding in respect of the Groups defined contribution schemes was 0.4 million 2003: 0.5 million.
