Pension costs The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 and the disclosures given in a below are those required by that standard.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets FRS17 was issued in November 2000 and the transitional disclosures required by that standard, to the extent not covered in a, are set out in b below.
a The Group operates a dened benets pension scheme in which the majority of its UK employees participate, with assets held in separate trustee administered funds the dened benets scheme.
This scheme was closed to new entrants from 6 April 2002, but benets continue to accrue for existing active members.
A dened contribution scheme has been established for joiners after 6 April 2002, to which the Group contributes at the rate of 4 per cent of pensionable pay.
The pension cost for the Groups UK schemes was 3,400,000 2003 - 3,757,000.
A triennial valuation of the dened benets scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2002, using the projected unit method, by Jonathan Punter, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, Punter Southall & Co Ltd the dened benets schemes actuary, who is independent of the Group.
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted for the purposes of both SSAP24 and determining the funding rate in the valuation were: a long term interest rate investment return of 7.0 per cent per annum before Normal Retirement Age NRA and 6.0 per cent after NRA: salary increases of 3.5 per cent per annum and limited price indexation of 2.5 per cent per annum.
Pension increases were allowed for in accordance with the rules of the dened benets scheme and past practice.
At the valuation date, the actuarial value of the assets on this basis was sufficient to cover 88 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members equivalent to a deficit of 12.6 million.
The market value of the dened benets schemes assets as at 6 April 2002 was 98.6 million.
For the purpose of the actuarial valuation, assets were taken at 97.7 per cent of the market value.
The dened benets schemes actuary recommended that the contribution rate of 8.25 per cent of pensionable pay was appropriate.
This recommendation was accepted by the Company and the Trustee.
37 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continued 4.
Information regarding employees, directors and pension costs continued After extensive discussions between the Company and the Trustee, the level of benets accruing to members of the dened benets scheme was reduced and the contribution rate paid by the Company increased to 10.6 per cent of pensionable pay with effect from 25 May 2004.
In addition a one-off amount of 25 million was paid by the Company into the scheme at the same time.
As a result a prepayment of 25,068,000 2003 creditor of 186,000, inclusive of interest accrued, is included in debtors in respect of the dened benets scheme.
The pension cost relating to foreign schemes was 1,680,000 2003 1,165,000.
The foreign schemes are dened contribution schemes and are principally Section 401 k Plans in the USA.
b The FRS17 disclosures below have been based on the actuarial valuation of the dened benets scheme as at 6 April 2002 adjusted to allow for the assumptions and actuarial methodology required by FRS17 and updated to 30 July 2004 by the dened benets schemes actuary.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 30 July 2004 1 August 2003 2 August 2002 per annum per annum per annum Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% 3.6% 3.5% Rate of increase in pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.9% 2.6% 2.5% Discount rate 5.7% 5.5% 5.9% Ination assumption 2.9% 2.6% 2.5% The FRS17 assumptions are similar to those used for funding and the SSAP24 disclosures, except for the lower investment return assumption discount rate used of 5.7 per cent which is based on corporate bond yields.
This has the effect of increasing the value placed on the liabilities and thereby increases the deficit disclosed.
The higher investment return used for funding and SSAP24 purposes reects the higher return expected in the long term by investing in asset classes other than corporate bonds, in particular equities.
The assets, the expected rates of return on the assets and the liabilities of the scheme were: Long term Long term Long term rate of return rate of return rate of return expected at Value at expected at Value at expected at Value at 30 July 2004 30 July 2004 1 August 2003 1 August 2003 2 August 2002 2 August 2002 per annum 000 per annum 000 per annum 000 Equities or equivalent 7.0% 62,505 7.0% 58,224 7.0% 57,462 Bonds 5.3% 39,276 5.2% 34,384 5.7% 25,357 Other 4.5% 27,089 4.8% 2,377 5.0% 3,125 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total market value of assets 128,870 94,985 85,944 Present value of liabilities 173,801 156,753 123,507 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme 44,931 61,768 37,563 Related deferred tax asset 13,479 18,530 11,269 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net pension liability 31,452 43,238 26,294 aaaasdf aaaasdf aaaasdf 38 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 The effect on the Groups profit and loss account and the statement of total recognised gains and losses in respect of the dened benets scheme, had FRS17 been adopted during the year, would have been as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 Analysis of the amount charged to operating profit: Current service cost 5,032 4,289 Past service cost aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Total operating charge 5,032 4,289 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Analysis of the amount charged to other finance costs: Expected return on pension scheme assets 6,290 5,725 Interest on pension scheme liabilities 8,764 7,446 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net finance charge 2,474 1,721 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net charge to profit and loss account 7,506 6,010 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2004 2003 000 000 Analysis of amount recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses: Actual return less expected return on pension scheme assets 1,207 1,431 Experience gains and losses arising on the scheme liabilities 1,505 5,344 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the scheme liabilities 3,632 15,001 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Actuarial loss recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses 6,344 21,776 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2004 2003 000 000 Movement in deficit during the year: deficit in the scheme at beginning of year 61,768 37,563 Movement in year: Current service cost 5,032 4,289 Contributions 30,687 3,581 Past service costs Other net finance charges 2,474 1,721 Actuarial loss 6,344 21,776 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf deficit in the scheme at end of year 44,931 61,768 aaaasdf aaaasdf 39 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 N OTES TO THE F INANCIAL S TATEMENTS continued 4.
Information regarding employees, directors and pension costs continued The actuarial valuation, adjusted for FRS17 and updated at 30 July 2004, showed a deficit of 44.9 million.
Contributions for the year were paid at the recommended rate of 8.25 per cent of pensionable pay to 24 May 2004 and 10.6 per cent of pensionable pay thereafter.
In addition a oneoff amount of 25 million was paid in May 2004.
The contribution rate will be reviewed at the next formal valuation of the dened benets scheme, which is due no later than as at 6 April 2005.
This scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 6 April 2002.
As a result, the current service cost calculated using the projected unit method will increase over time expressed as a percentage of pensionable pay but will be applied to a shrinking pensionable payroll.
The effect on the Groups balance sheet, had FRS17 been adopted at the year end in respect of the dened benets scheme, would have been as follows: 2004 2003 Restated note 23 000 000 Net assets: Net assets before pension liability 222,758 239,437 Less SSAP 24 prepayment net of related deferred tax 23,125 Net pension liability 31,452 43,238 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf Net assets after pension liability 168,181 196,199 aaaasdf aaaasdf Reserves: profit and loss reserve before pension liability 167,193 184,144 Less SSAP 24 prepayment net of related deferred tax 23,125 Net pension liability 31,452 43,238 aaaaaaaaaaadf aaaaaaaaaaadf profit and loss reserve after pension liability 112,616 140,906 aaaasdf aaaasdf 2004 2003 2002 qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq qqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqqq 000 % 000 % 000 % History of experience gains and losses: Difference between the expected and actual return on scheme assets: Amount 1,207 1,431 20,711 Percentage of scheme assets 1 2 24 Experience gains and losses on scheme liabilities: Amount 1,505 5,344 1,064 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 1 3 1 Total amount recognised in statement of total recognised gains and losses: Amount 6,344 21,776 22,294 Percentage of the present value of the scheme liabilities 4 14 18 40 S T IVES PLC ANNUAL REPOR T AND ACCOUNTS 2004 5.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on profit after taxation as disclosed in the profit and loss account of 3,000,000 2003 22,483,000.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated by adding back exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, as adjusted for taxation, to the profit after taxation.

The calculation of the diluted earnings per share is based on profit after taxation as disclosed in the profit and loss account and on a diluted weighted average of 102,888,405 2003 103,101,320 shares during the year.
The difference between the number of shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation is 105,115 2003 39,190 representing dilutive share options held but not yet exercised.

Derivatives and other financial instruments a Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through a mixture of retained earnings and bank borrowings and generally maintains a positive net funds position.
Group policy is to manage exposure risk to interest rate uctuations with bank borrowings, predominantly short term, at oating rates with matching short term deposits of surplus funds.
b Liquidity risk The Groups policy is to maintain exibility with respect to its liquidity position, by utilising short term cash deposits and where necessary short term bank borrowings for all working capital and capital expenditure requirements.
It is the Groups policy to utilise, if appropriate, bank borrowings in foreign currencies to finance overseas acquisitions, which also provide a hedge against net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
c Foreign currency risk The Group has overseas subsidiaries which operate in the USA, Germany and Holland and whose revenues and expenses are denominated exclusively in the relevant foreign currencies.
In order to provide some protection to the Groups Sterling balance sheet from the movements in these foreign exchange rates, the Group may, if appropriate, finance a part of its net investment in these subsidiaries by means of overseas borrowings subject to the interest cost of those borrowings.
The extent of this nancing at 30 July 2004 was 44 per cent of the gross investment in foreign currencies.
The Groups UK subsidiaries sales are principally with customers in the UK, and are denominated in Sterling.
d Financial instruments A discussion of the Groups objectives, policies and strategies with regard to derivative financial instruments, can be found in the accounting policies note on pages 34 and 35.

Matched assets and liabilities are those that generate no gain or loss in the profit and loss account, either because they are denominated in the same currency as the Group operations to which they belong or because they qualify under Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 20 Foreign Currency Translation as a foreign currency borrowing providing a hedge against a foreign equity investment.
