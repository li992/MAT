Accounting policies 44 45 The Groups accounting policies are as follows: Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention, as modified by Notes to the financial statements the inclusion of investment properties at valuation, and in accordance with accounting standards currently applicable in the United Kingdom.
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those used in preparing the previous audited financial statements except for the adoption of application note G to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, which applies for the first time for this financial year, as disclosed in note 2.
Consolidation The audited financial statements of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated, with the exception that where, in the opinion of the Directors, severe long-term restrictions exist over the control of a subsidiary, that subsidiary is accounted for as a joint venture under the gross equity method of accounting prescribed by FRS 9 Associates and joint ventures.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, a separate profit and loss account for the Company is not presented.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired.
In accordance with FRS 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, goodwill arising on acquisitions is capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over an appropriate period not exceeding 20 years.
Acquisitions and disposals Where subsidiary and associated undertakings are acquired or disposed of during a period, the Group profit and loss account includes their results from or to the date of acquisition or disposal.
Investment property Investment properties are included in the financial statements at valuation.
The aggregate surplus from original cost is transferred to a revaluation reserve.
Any aggregate unrealised deficit from original cost is charged to the profit and loss account.
On realisation any gain or loss is calculated by reference to the carrying value at the last balance sheet date and is included in the profit and loss account.
Any balance in the revaluation reserve is transferred to the profit and loss account reserve.
In accordance with SSAP 19 Revised Accounting for investment properties, investment properties are revalued annually.
No provision is made for depreciation or amortisation of properties held for investment purposes.
The Companies Act 1985 requires all properties to be depreciated, but that requirement conflicts with the generally accepted principle set out in SSAP 19 Revised.
The Directors consider that, as the properties are held for long-term investment, a true and fair view is given following SSAP 19 Revised.
Depreciation is only one of the many factors reflected in the annual valuation of properties and the amount of depreciation or amortisation which might otherwise have been charged cannot be separately identified or quantified in a meaningful way.
Additions to properties in the course of development or refurbishment include the cost of finance and directly attributable internal and external costs incurred during the period of development until practical completion.
Property transactions Purchases and sales are recognised on exchange of contracts provided that, if the exchange is conditional, all material conditions have been satisfied shortly thereafter.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are included at cost.
Where the value of these investments is below cost and is considered to be a permanent diminution, the deficit is written off to the profit and loss account.
If the diminution in value is not considered to be permanent, no such write off is made.
Turnover Group turnover comprises rental income, service charge income and other amounts receivable from tenants.
Rental income is recognised after treating lease incentives that do not enhance the property as a revenue reduction and spread evenly over the period to the earlier of the first rent review or the lease term.
Accounting policies continued n Refurbishment costs Refurbishment expenditure in respect of major works is capitalised.
Renovation and refurbishment expenditure of a revenue nature is written off as incurred.
Ez Depreciation and amortisation The cost of other fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental expenses of acquisition.
eki The cost of leasehold improvements is depreciated over the remaining life of the lease.
Motor vehicles and fixtures and fittings are depreciated el over their expected lives of between three and five years.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in future.
A deferred tax asset is recognised when its recoverability is considered to be reasonably certain.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates which apply at the balance sheet date.
No provision is made for tax liabilities on unrealised revaluation gains at the balance sheet date.
Operating leases Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
Pension costs Employer contributions to personal pension schemes of employees are charged to the profit and loss account as they are incurred.
Financial instruments Interest payable and receivable is accounted for on an accruals basis.
Interest differentials on derivative instruments are recognised by adjusting the relevant interest amount.
Bank loans are included in the financial statements net of issue costs which are amortised over the life of the loan.
Significant accounting policies in respect of the Scarlett Retail Group Limited Scarlett Retail joint venture are: Turnover Turnover consists of sales of merchandise and services to third parties net of VAT, discounts and estimated returns and includes the profit contribution earned on agency sales including concession departments.
Sales are recognised at point of sale, or later delivery date as appropriate.
Tangible fixed assets Where properties are carried at valuation they are held at their current value on an existing use basis as at the balance sheet date.
Their current value is determined by having a qualified valuer perform a full, detailed valuation at least once every five years and an interim external valuation in year three.
In years one, two and four, a review is performed and if it indicates that it is likely that there has been a material change in value, then an interim valuation will be performed by a qualified external valuer.
Stocks Goods held for resale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Operating leases Property lease rentals are accounted for on a straight-line basis to each rent review.
Lease incentives and rent free periods are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Pension costs Defined benefit liabilities are funded by payments to schemes controlled by independent trustees on the advice of external actuaries.
Pension costs are accounted for on the basis of charging the expected costs of providing pensions over the period during which the Company benefits from employee services.
The effects of variations from regular cost are spread over the expected average remaining service lives of members of the scheme.
Comparatives 46 47an Ezekiel In November 2003, the Accounting Standards Board issued an amendment application note G to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of Notes to the financial statements continued transactions.
Recoverable property expenses, which include service charge expenses and insurance, had previously been shown net of the contributions received from tenants within net property outgoings.
Following the issue of application note G, the gross value of these expenses is included within property outgoings and the contribution from tenants is included within turnover.
Concession sales and staff discounts were previously included in the Groups share of joint venture turnover.
Following the issue of application note G, the Groups share of joint venture turnover includes commission only on concession sales and sales to staff net of discounts.
The effect of adopting application note G was to decrease Group and share of joint venture turnover by 64,264,000 year to 30 June 2003: 14,268,000, increase Group turnover by 4,429,000 year to 30 June 2003: 4,779,000 and increase net property outgoings by 4,429,000 year to 30 June 2003: 4,779,000.

Joint venture 52 53an Ezekiel Introduction The Group has an investment in Scarlett Retail Group Limited Scarlett Retail, a joint venture with Lehman Brothers and Notes to the financial statements continued Scarlett Retails management team.
Scarlett Retail was incorporated in England and Wales and acquired Allders plc, a UK department store and homeware retailer, in February 2003.
Scarlett Retail operates in the United Kingdom.
The Groups share of the profit and loss account, gross assets and gross liabilities of Scarlett Retail is derived from the audited consolidated financial statements for the period ended 26 June 2004 2003: 28 June 2003.
The Groups interest in Scarlett Retail comprises an investment in the ordinary and preference share capital as follows: Amount held Amount held Total by Group by Group 000 000 % Ordinary shares 100 60 60.0 Preference shares 14,063 10,375 73.8 14,163 10,435 The ordinary shares held by the Group rank pari passu with the other ordinary shares.
The preference shares, which are cumulative and which have a coupon of 20 per cent per annum, are redeemable by 31 December 2008 or, if earlier, on a sale or listing of Scarlett Retails shares.
On a return of capital, the assets of Scarlett Retail are to be applied to i the accrued unpaid dividend and related share capital to preference shareholders calculated to the date of return of capital ii pari passu to holders of ordinary shares.
The Scarlett Retail shareholders agreement sets out certain restrictions over the Groups control of Scarlett Retails operating and financial activities.
The Directors consider that these represent severe long-term restrictions as defined in FRS 2 Accounting for subsidiary undertakings on the Groups control of Scarlett Retail and accordingly the Group has accounted for its investment in Scarlett Retail under the gross equity method specified by FRS 9 Associates and joint ventures.
Investment Total 000 Net investment at 1 July 2003 3,069 Group share of loss after taxation for the year 21,695 Group share of unrealised revaluation surplus 26,116 Unrealised share of joint venture gain 6,439 Net investment at 30 June 2004 13,929 During the year the Group purchased a property from Scarlett Retail for 48,825,000.
This resulted in a profit on disposal in the results of Scarlett Retail.
In accordance with FRS 9 Associates and joint ventures the Groups share of the profit of 6,439,000 is not recognised in the consolidated profit and loss account and is instead treated as an unrealised gain.

The Scheme, which was closed to further pension contributions with effect from 31 March 2004, is funded in accordance with the advice of the Scheme actuary, is subject to independent actuarial valuations every three years and has its assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the Scheme was carried out as at 30 September 2003 and showed that the market value of the assets of the Scheme was sufficient to cover 88 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for future salary increases.
This was updated to 26 June 2004 by a qualified independent actuary.
Had FRS 17 Retirement benefits been adopted early in full, the impact on the total net assets and profit and loss reserves would have been to reduce the Groups net assets and profit and loss reserves as follows: 2004 2003 Group share Group share 000 000 Net pension liability 5,101 6,607 Less amount already included under SSAP 24 3,436 3,031 1,665 3,576 17.

Financial instruments The Group has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments to exclude short-term debtors and creditors from the following disclosures.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets comprise investments note 15 and cash at bank and in hand note 18.
The cash at bank and in hand, consists mainly of short-term deposits with maturity periods of less than one year and earns interest at the rate prevailing at the time of the deposit for the term of the deposit.
Maturity of financial liabilities The debt maturity profile of the Groups bank and building society borrowings at 30 June 2004 is as follows: 30 June 2004 30 June 2003 000 000 Less than one year 8,809 7,687 Between one and two years 17,291 8,137 Between two and five years 198,976 107,067 Over five years 465,668 547,261 690,744 670,152 Unamortised loan issue costs 3,858 4,175 686,886 665,977 21.

The weighted average interest rate shown for fixed rate liabilities is 7.0 per cent 2003: 7.0 per cent and includes loan margins ranging from 0.8 per cent to 1.6 per cent with all inclusive interest rates ranging from 5.5 per cent to 8.1 per cent 2003: 5.5 per cent to 8.1 per cent.
Floating rate debt incurs interest at margins between 0.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent over LIBOR 2003: 0.9 per cent and 1.6 per cent.
The Group has also entered into a forward-dated swap to commence in March 2005 and which expires in December 2008.
This is for 57,500,000 and will replace an existing swap for the same amount which is due to expire in March 2005.
In addition, as part of a strategy to hedge the interest rate exposure on the refinancing of existing loans as they mature in the medium-term, the Group has acquired interest rate swaptions during the year to hedge loan amounts totalling 175,000,000.
The swaptions, which may be exercised on specific dates in 2007 8, have an exercise interest rate of 5.25 per cent and a total acquisition cost of 4,935,000.
Financial instruments continued Fair values A valuation was carried out as at 30 June 2004 by J C Rathbone Associates Limited, to calculate the fair value of the Groups financial instruments on a replacement basis, taking into account the difference between fixed and fixed-swapped interest rates for the Group borrowings and the prevailing interest rates for the respective periods of the appropriate financial instruments.
The valuation at 30 June 2004 of the fixed rate loans and interest rate swaps referred to above are as follows: 30 June 2004 30 June 2003 Fair value Fair value Book value Fair value difference Book value Fair value difference 000 000 000 000 000 000 Fixed rate loans 290,920 303,473 12,553 293,932 331,904 37,972 Derivative instruments: Interest rate swaps 3,511 3,511 28,693 28,693 Interest rate swaptions 4,935 5,860 925 285,985 301,124 15,139 293,932 360,597 66,665 The fair value at 30 June 2004 was 15,139,000 2003: 66,665,000 greater than the book value, which if taken to reserves after tax relief at 30 per cent, would reduce the Groups net asset value by 10,597,000 or 6.6 pence per share.
Hedges The table below shows the extent to which the Group has unrecognised gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning and end of the year, separately identifying those gains and losses which have been included in the profit and loss account for this year and those gains and losses which are expected to be included in the profit and loss account of subsequent periods: 30 June 2004 30 June 2003 000 000 Unrecognised net losses on hedges at beginning of year 28,693 9,632 Net losses in previous years that were recognised during the year 6,961 5,875 Net losses arising on hedges in existence as at previous year end and not recognised during current year 21,732 3,757 Net gains losses arising this year that were not recognised in current year 19,146 24,936 Unrecognised net losses on hedges at end of year 2,586 28,693 of which: Net losses expected to be recognised within one year 2,679 8,440 Net gains losses expected to be recognised beyond one year 93 20,253 2,586 28,693 The gains arising during the year reflect the effect of higher medium long-term interest rates when measured against those prevailing at 30 June 2003.
Gearing Net gearing, measured as Group net debt before offsetting unamortised loan issue costs to equity shareholders funds, was 96 per cent at 30 June 2004 2003: 104 per cent.
Currency risk The Group has no currency risk as all monetary assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
Further details are set out in the Chief Financial Officers review on pages 20 to 23.
Provisions for liabilities and charges 58 59an Ezekiel Group Group Notes to the financial statements continued 30 June 2004 30 June 2003 000 000 At 1 July 2003 5,223 3,924 Charge for the year 893 1,299 At 30 June 2004 6,116 5,223 The provision which is entirely for deferred tax, comprises: Group Group 30 June 2004 30 June 2003 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances and other timing differences 18,303 12,167 Losses available to offset 12,187 6,944 6,116 5,223 On the basis that capital allowances claimed to date will not be retained by the Group, the potential amount of further taxation, for which no provision has been made and which could arise if the properties held as investments were sold at the values at which they appear in the balance sheet, has been estimated at 75.5 million.
Tax losses of approximately 69.5 million have not been recognised in the balance sheet, of which approximately 56.7 million have been used to reduce the contingent tax.
If account is taken of the likelihood that capital allowances claimed to date will be retained by the Group, then the potential tax liability which could arise if the properties were sold at the values at which they appear in the balance sheet has been estimated to be 63.3 million.
This is calculated on the same basis as above except that additional tax losses of 40.6 million would be available to reduce the contingent tax.
