London Merchant Securities plc 38 Notes on the Accounts 1 Accounting policies Accounting convention The accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of investment properties and subsidiary undertakings, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985, except as noted below.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups accounts.
The Group has also implemented the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Basis of consolidation Except as explained below, the consolidated accounts incorporate the results of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31st March.
Subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting unless the criteria for merger accounting are met.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 a separate profit and loss account for the Company is not presented with these accounts.
Investment Division investments that are subsidiary undertakings are carried at cost less amounts, if any, written off to reflect impairment in value, in accordance with the Companys normal accounting policy for such investments, and are not consolidated as required by FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings.
These investments within the Groups portfolio are held for resale with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, although not necessarily with a view to disposal within one year of acquisition.
The Groups exposure to these companies is limited to its investment at the balance sheet date.
Consequently, the directors consider that consolidation would not give a true and fair view of the Groups interest in these investments.
This treatment reflects the application of the true and fair override to FRS 2.
It is not practicable to determine the effects of the application of the true and fair override on the financial statements.
Additional information on the subsidiary undertakings not consolidated is given in note 12.
Investment properties In accordance with SSAP 19 Accounting for Investment Properties, investment properties are revalued annually at open market value determined in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.
Revaluation surpluses and deficits are included in the revaluation reserve, permanent deficits being taken through the profit and loss account.
No depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties with over 20 years to run.
This treatment, which is in accordance with SSAP 19, may be a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act concerning depreciation of fixed assets.
However, these properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation or amortisation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
Investment Division investments Investments are stated at cost less amounts written off to reflect permanent diminution in value.
Those investments that are associated undertakings are carried at cost in accordance with the Groups normal policy and are not equity accounted as required by the Companies Act 1985.
The directors consider that as these investments are held as part of the Groups portfolio with a view to the ultimate realisation of capital gains, equity accounting would not give a true and fair view of the Groups interest in these investments.
It is not practicable to determine the effects of this departure which is in accordance with FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures on the financial statements.
Other tangible assets These comprise computers, furniture, fixtures and fittings, and improvements to Group occupied properties and are depreciated on a straight-line basis to estimated residual values over their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
Goodwill Goodwill, including negative goodwill, arising on acquisition is calculated based upon a comparison of the fair value of the assets acquired and the fair value of the consideration given and other costs of acquisition.
The negative goodwill arising on the acquisition during the year of Inflexion plc see note 25 will be carried on the balance sheet and released to the profit and loss account as the Inflexion plc assets, to which the negative goodwill relates, are realised or impaired.
Trading properties Trading properties are valued at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Interest and other outgoings on property developments Interest and other outgoings on vacant properties prior to redevelopment are treated as revenue expenditure and written off as incurred.
Interest costs on properties in development are written off as incurred.
London Merchant Securities plc 39 Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates of exchange prevailing at that date, and exchange differences are included in the profit and loss account.
The results and balance sheets of overseas operations are translated at the closing rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences arising on translation of the opening net assets are dealt with through reserves.
Investment Division investments denominated in foreign currencies remain at the initial recorded amount and are not retranslated as these balances represent the historical cost of acquiring these investments.
Operating lease incentives Operating lease incentives include rent free periods and other incentives such as contributions towards fitting out costs given to lessees on entering into lease agreements.
In accordance with UITF Abstract 28 Operating Lease Incentives, rent receivable in the period from lease commencement to the earlier of the first rent review to the prevailing market rate and the lease end date, is spread evenly over that period.
The cost of other incentives is spread on a straight-line basis over a similar period.
Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purpose of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash at or close to their carrying values or traded in an active market.
Liquid resources comprise of short-term cash deposits.
Cost of raising finance Debt instruments are stated at their net proceeds on issue.
Issue costs are amortised to the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument and are included in interest payable.
Pensions Contributions to the Groups pension and life assurance schemes are charged to profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
UITF Abstract 17 The Group operates an Inland Revenue approved employee share option scheme and has taken advantage of the exemption given in UITF Abstract 17 Employee Share Schemes from recognising a charge in the profit and loss account for the discount on the option.
Taxation Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
On disposal of an investment property the element of tax relating to the profit in the year is charged to the profit and loss account and the element relating to earlier revaluation surpluses is included in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the financial statements and their recognition in a tax computation.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
In accordance with FRS 19 Deferred Tax, deferred tax is provided in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on the sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
Subsidiary undertakings valuation The Companys investments in the shares of Group undertakings are stated at directors valuation on a basis which takes account of the net assets of the undertakings at 31st March 2004 which will include, where applicable, the professional valuation of properties and the carrying value of Investment Division investments.
Surpluses and deficits arising from the directors valuation are taken to revaluation reserve in the Company balance sheet, permanent diminutions in value are taken to the Company profit and loss account.

London Merchant Securities plc 42 Notes on the Accounts continued 5 Pension costs The assets of the pension schemes are held separately from those of the Group companies.
The Group operates a defined benefit scheme which is contributory for members, provides benefits based on final pensionable salary and contributions are invested in a Unitised with Profit Policy with Sun Alliance and London Insurance Company Limited plus annuity policies held in the name of the Trustees.
With effect from 6th April 2001 the Company introduced a plan to pay contributions to personal pensions established with a specific provider.
New employees are eligible to join this arrangement: the defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants.
Inflexion plc, the Groups 58.8% owned subsidiary, pays contributions to personal pensions for its employees.
The pension charge for the Group was 2.5 million 2003 3.4 million.
The pension charge for the defined benefit scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary.
The most important assumptions made in connection with the establishment of this charge were that interest will be earned on the fund at the rate of 5.4% per annum and that salaries will be increased at 4.5% per annum.
The market value of assets of the scheme at 31st March 2004 was 4.6 million and the actuarial value of those assets on an ongoing basis represented 35.7% of the benefit of 12.9 million that had accrued to members allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Net of the related deferred tax asset the pension deficit is 5.8 million.
The employer will pay an enhanced contribution designed to eliminate the underfunding over the next three to five years.
The Company has applied the phased transitional rules under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The additional disclosures required by FRS 17 have been based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 1st November 2003 and use the following financial assumptions as at 31st March 2004.
2004 2003 2002 % per annum % per annum % per annum Future salary growth 4.5% 3.9% 4.5% Discount rate 5.4% 5.4% 5.9% Rate of increase in pension payments 5.0% 5.0% 5.0% Inflation rate 3.0% 2.7% 3.0% The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale involved, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

As explained in note 25, LMS plc entered into arrangements with Inflexion plc in respect of the shares transferred as part of the acquisition consideration.
25 Acquisition of Inflexion plc On 6th February 2004 Inflexion plc issued Ordinary shares in consideration for a portfolio of the Groups listed investments plus gilts to a total value of 12 million.
This transaction resulted in the Group owning 50.5% of Inflexion plc.
At the same time, the Group undertook to subscribe 6 million in cash to an open offer of Inflexion plc shares.
When the open offer closed, on 2nd March 2004, the Group had a total interest of 58.8% in Inflexion plc.
The acquisition is treated as made on 6th February 2004.
The book value and fair value of the assets acquired and the resulting negative goodwill is shown below.

This represented a profit over the Groups book cost of 1.6 million.
41.2% of this amount 0.7 million being the gain attributable to that part of the investment portfolio effectively disposed of to the Inflexion plc minority, has been credited to reserves in accordance with UITF31.
London Merchant Securities plc has agreed to subscribe 15 million in total in cash for B Ordinary shares in Inflexion plc at a price per share equal to 90% of Inflexions consolidated net asset value per issued Ordinary share at the time of subscription.
This is reflected in the balance sheet of LMS plc.
The timing of these subscriptions will be at the Companys option but no later than 30th September 2009, and only during the 30 day period following the publication of Inflexion plcs preliminary statement of results for each of the financial years up to and including the year ending 31st March 2009.
In respect of three of the investments transferred to Inflexion plc, Crown Sports Plc, DMATEK Limited and NMT Group Plc, comprising 7.9 million of the acquisition consideration, Inflexion has the option to require the Group to buy the investments back, subject to certain conditions being satisfied, for 80% of the acquisition value.
As part of this arrangement the Group is entitled to receive a preferential share of any increase in value of the investment.
At 31st March 2004, the option in respect of NMT Group Plc comprising 0.5 million of the consideration, had lapsed and no liability had arisen.
The option still exists in respect of Crown Sports Plc 31st March 2004 market value 4.1 million: acquisition value 4.3 million and DMATEK Limited 31st March 2004 market value 3.6 million: acquisition value 3.1 million.
