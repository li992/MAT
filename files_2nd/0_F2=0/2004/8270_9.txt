A number of criteria are applied when deciding whether pre-approval for such services should be given.
These include the nature of the service, the level of fees, and the practicality of appointing an alternative provider, having regard to the skills and experience required to supply the service effectively.
Cumulative fees for audit and non-audit services are presented to the Audit Committee on a quarterly basis for review.
The Audit Committee is responsible for monitoring adherence to the pre-approval policy.

The plans are predominantly defined benefit schemes for current members.
For new entrants, the plans provide defined contribution benefits.
The assets of the plans are held in self-administered trust funds separate from the Groups assets.
The Group also maintains a US-based InterContinental Hotels Pension Plan.
This plan is now closed to new members and pensionable service no longer accrues for current employee members.
In addition, the Group operates a number of minor pension schemes outside the United Kingdom, the most significant of which is a defined contribution scheme in the United States: there is no material difference between the pension costs of, and contributions to, these schemes.
On 1 April 2003, two new pension schemes were created for InterContinental Hotels Group PLC in the UK when Mitchells & Butlers Retail Limited became the sponsoring employer for the Six Continents Pension Plan and the Six Continents Executive Pension Plan.
Approximately 30% of the assets and liabilities of these plans was transferred to the new InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan and the Britvic Pension Plan, which were established with effect from 1 April 2003.
The Group continues to account for its defined benefit obligations in accordance with SSAP 24.
The pension costs related to the two UK principal plans are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
They reflect the 31 March 2004 actuarial valuations of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan and the Britvic Pension Plan.
The significant assumptions in these valuations were that wages and salaries increase on average by 4.3% per annum, the long-term return on assets is 6.5% per annum, and pensions increase by 2.8% per annum.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is 12 years.
At 31 March 2004, the market value of the combined assets of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan was 148m and the Britvic Pension Plan was 240m and the value of the assets was sufficient to cover 80% and 75%, respectively, of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in earnings.
In the period to 31 December 2004, the Group made regular contributions to the two UK principal plans of 12m and additional contributions of 60m.
The agreed employer contribution rates to the defined benefit arrangements for the year to 31 December 2005 are 15.6% for the staff section of the InterContinental Hotels UK Pension Plan, 31.4% for the executive section, 16.9% for the staff section of the Britvic Pension Plan and 32.3% for the executive section.
48 InterContinental Hotels Group 2004 Notes to the financial statements 5 PENSIONS CONTINUED Certain pension benefits and post-retirement insurance obligations are provided on an unfunded basis.
Where assets are not held with the specific purpose of matching the liabilities of unfunded schemes, a provision is included within other provisions for liabilities and charges.
Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
FRS 17 disclosures The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures are based on the results of the actuarial valuations at 31 March 2004 updated by independent qualified actuaries to 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at market value at 31 December 2004 and the liabilities of the schemes have been assessed as at the same date using the projected unit method.
As the principal plans are now closed as defined benefit schemes, the current service cost as calculated under the projected unit method will increase as members approach retirement.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated by adjusting basic earnings per ordinary share to reflect the notional exercise of the weighted average number of dilutive ordinary share options outstanding during the period.
The resulting weighted average number of ordinary shares is 718m 2003 733m.
On 10 December 2004, shareholders approved a share capital consolidation on the basis of 25 new ordinary shares for every 28 existing ordinary shares, together with a special dividend of 72 pence per existing share.
The overall effect of the transaction was that of a share repurchase at fair value, therefore no adjustment has been made to comparative data.
