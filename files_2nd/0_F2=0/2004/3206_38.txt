Tel 2 million and Centrica Energy 1 million, changes to the property portfolio 19 million as well as the acceleration of elements of the British Gas transformation programme 60 million.
A tax credit of 26 million has been recognised in connection with these costs and those discussed in ii and iii below.
ii Unforeseen water break-through into the Rose well resulted in the well being shut in.
A work-over of the well to isolate the water producing zone has been successful.
However, due to water ingress it is now anticipated that the maximum recoverable volume is 25 bcf.
This has resulted in an impairment charge of 50 million.
A discount rate of 8% was applied in calculating the recoverable amount which was not a risk-free rate.
iii In 1997 Centrica renegotiated certain long-term take-or-pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay for gas that would be excess to requirements and or at prices above likely market rates.
A provision was made covering the net present cost of estimated further payments resulting from those renegotiations including one due for future settlement in 2008 based on the reserves in a group of third-party fields.
Published estimates of these reserves during the year have indicated a reduction from the 1997 forecast level of reserves.
The provision has been reduced by 51 million based on a conservative view of the revised reserve levels.
iv In 2003 the loss on closure of business related to the closure of the Direct Energy home services retail stores in Ontario on which a tax credit of 6 million was recognised.
v Discontinued operations in 2004 relate to the disposal of 100% of the share capital of the AA for which cash consideration of 1,602 million was received, resulting in a pre-tax non-operating profit of 727 million see note 24 ii.
The disposal of shares qualifies for substantial shareholding exemption and, consequently, no tax charge has been recognised in relation to the profit.
A tax credit of 13 million has been recognised on certain costs that qualify for tax relief, giving a post-tax non-operating profit on disposal of 740 million.
In the previous year the Goldfish credit card and loan business was disposed of for a premium of 112.5 million over the receivables book value, resulting in a pre-tax non-operating loss on disposal of 51 million on which a tax credit of 10 million and a minority interest charge of 2 million were recognised.

qxd 13 3 05 12:16 pm Page 48 Notes to the financial statements continued 8 Tax continued b Factors affecting the tax charge for the year The differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 2004 2003 m m Profit on ordinary activities before tax 1,708 778 Less: share of joint ventures and associates profit before tax 49 44 Group profit on ordinary activities before tax 1,659 734 Tax on group profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 2003: 30% 498 220 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including goodwill amortisation 30 48 Depreciation in excess of capital allowances 31 23 Utilisation of tax losses and other short-term timing differences 57 25 Deferred petroleum revenue tax relief 41 39 Higher tax rates on overseas earnings 4 5 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of prior years 44 6 Supplementary charge applicable to upstream profits 60 47 Exceptional profit on disposal of the AA 231 Group current tax charge for the year 250 285 c Factors that may affect future tax charges The group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%.
A supplementary charge of 10% is also currently applicable on the groups UK upstream profits.
Fair values are attributed to fixed assets on acquisition of businesses and companies and amortisation or depreciation is subsequently provided based upon those amounts.
Were the assets to be sold at the book values at the balance sheet date without the benefit of tax planning arrangements, the amount of tax that would be payable is estimated in aggregate to be 206 million 2003: 180 million of which 128 million 2003: 121 million is provided as a deferred tax liability.
There is, however, no intention to sell any of these assets in the foreseeable future and therefore the crystallisation of the above tax charge is considered to be remote.
9 Dividends 2004 2003 m m Interim dividend of 2.5p 2003: 1.7p per ordinary share 105 72 Special dividend of 25p per ordinary share 1,051 Proposed final dividend of 6.1p 2003: 3.7p per ordinary share 230 157 Final dividend in respect of share issues after the balance sheet date 1 1,387 229 The interim and special dividends were paid on 17 November 2004 and the proposed final dividend is payable on 15 June 2005 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 29 April 2005.
The payment of the special dividend amounting to 1,051 million was approved by the shareholders on 21 October 2004 at the extraordinary general meeting.
The shareholders also approved the consolidation of the share capital of the company by the issue 14 5 of 9 new ordinary shares of 6 81 pence each for every 10 existing shares of 5 9 pence each.

qxd 13 3 05 12:16 pm Page 49 10 Earnings per ordinary share Basic earnings per ordinary share have been calculated by dividing the earnings for the year of 1,382 million 2003: 500 million by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 4,184 million 2003: 4,235 million.
The number of shares excluded 18 million ordinary shares 2003: 26 million, being the weighted average number of the companys own shares held in the employee share trust which are treated as cancelled.
As described in note 9, during the year the company paid a special dividend of 1,051 million and at the same time carried out a consolidation of its share capital.
These transactions were conditional on each other and designed in a way to achieve the same overall effect on the companys capital structure as a share repurchase, in which all shareholders could participate.
Accordingly, earnings per share are presented on the basis that in substance a share repurchase has occurred and therefore 2003 figures have not been restated in accordance with FRS 14 Earnings per share.
In addition to the payment of a special dividend and share consolidation, there was also a share repurchase programme in operation during the year as described in note 20.
The directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share adjusted for goodwill amortisation and exceptional charges assists with understanding the underlying performance of the group.
The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows: 2004 2003 Pence per Pence per m ordinary share m ordinary share Earnings basic 1,382 33.0 500 11.8 Exceptional items after tax and minority interests 662 15.8 53 1.2 Goodwill amortisation net of tax credit 119 2.8 161 3.8 Earnings adjusted basic 839 20.0 714 16.8 i Earnings diluted 1,382 32.5 500 11.6 i In addition to basic and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted earnings per ordinary share.
Under this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported earnings for either 2004 or 2003, but the weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted.
The adjustments relate to notional share awards made to employees under the long term incentive scheme.
The share options granted to employees under the share schemes were as follows: 2004 2003 million shares million shares Weighted average number of shares in issue 4,184 4,235 Estimated vesting of long term incentive scheme shares 26 39 Dilutive effect of shares to be issued at a discount to market value under the sharesave schemes 37 20 Potentially dilutive shares issuable under the executive share option scheme 4 2 Weighted average number of shares used in the calculation of diluted earnings per ordinary share 4,251 4,296 11 Intangible fixed assets goodwill m Cost 1 January 2004 2,002 i Acquisitions 262 Disposals see note 24 991 Exchange adjustments 12 31 December 2004 1,261 Amortisation 1 January 2004 388 Charge for the year 117 Disposals see note 24 248 Exchange adjustments 2 31 December 2004 255 Net book value ii 31 December 2004 1,006 31 December 2003 1,614 i Acquisitions include an adjustment to increase goodwill by 36 million following revised determination of the provisional contingent consideration estimated for WTU CPL.
The balance of goodwill arising, of 226 million, relates to acquisitions as detailed in note 24.
