The average price paid per share in 2004 was 2376 pence.
Between 1999 and 2003 a total of 92.8 million Ordinary Shares were re-purchased, and subsequently cancelled, at an average price of 2762 pence per share for a consideration, including expenses, of $3,959m.
The excess of the consideration over the nominal value was charged against the profit and loss account reserve.
Shares issued in respect of share schemes totalled 2.5 million.
In 1999, in connection with the merger, AstraZenecas share capital was redenominated in US dollars.
On 6 April 1999, Zeneca shares were cancelled and US dollar shares issued, credited as fully paid on the basis of one dollar share for each Zeneca share then held.
This was achieved by a reduction of capital under section 135 of the Companies Act 1985.
Upon the reduction of capital becoming effective, all issued and unissued Zeneca shares were cancelled and the sum arising as a result thereof credited to a special reserve which was converted into US dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing on the record date.
This US dollar reserve was then applied in paying up, at par, newly created US dollar shares.
At the same time as the US dollar shares were issued, the Company issued 50,000 Redeemable Preference Shares with a nominal value of 1.00 each for cash at par.
The Redeemable Preference Shares carry limited class voting rights and no dividend rights.
This class of shares is also capable of redemption at par at the option of the Company on the giving of seven days written notice to the registered holder of the shares.
A total of 826 million AstraZeneca shares were issued to Astra shareholders who accepted the merger offer before the final closing date, 21 May 1999.
AstraZeneca received acceptances from Astra shareholders representing 99.6 per cent of Astras shares and the remaining 0.4 per cent was acquired in 2000 for cash.

Taxation for US residents The following summary of the material UK and certain US tax consequences of ownership of Ordinary Shares or ADRs held as capital assets by US resident shareholders is based on current UK and US federal income tax law, including the new US UK double taxation convention relating to income and capital gains, which entered into force on 31 March 2003 the Convention and the prior US UK double taxation convention relating to income and capital gains the Prior Convention, and practice.
This discussion is also based in part on representations of JPMorgan Chase Bank as Depositary for ADRs and assumes that each obligation in the deposit agreement among the Company, the Depositary and the holders from time to time of ADRs and any related agreements will be performed in accordance with their terms.
The US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom ADRs are pre-released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming, by US holders of ADRs, of foreign tax credits for US federal income tax purposes.
Such actions could also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced tax rate, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident shareholders.
Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of UK taxes and the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain non-corporate US resident shareholders both as described below, could be affected by future actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADRs are pre-released.
UK and US income taxes and tax treaties affecting remittance of dividends Under the Prior Convention, US resident individuals who were the beneficial owners of dividends on Ordinary Shares, or ADRs representing Ordinary Shares, in UK corporations were generally entitled to a tax credit payment in respect of dividends equal to one-ninth 1 9th of the dividend paid the Tax Credit Amount.
This tax credit payment was reduced by a UK withholding the UK withholding of up to 15% of the gross dividend paid.
Therefore, a US holder would not actually receive any payment of this credit.
US resident corporate shareholders are generally treated in the same way as individuals provided that either alone, or together with associated corporations, they do not control directly or indirectly 10% or more of the voting shares of the Company and do not constitute investment or holding companies, 25% or more of the capital of which is owned, directly or indirectly, by persons that are not individuals resident in, and are not nationals of, the US.
Under the Convention, US resident shareholders are no longer entitled to the Tax Credit Amount because the Convention does not provide for that entitlement.
The Convention applies to dividend payments after 1 May 2003.
However, if a US resident shareholder would have been entitled to greater benefits under the Prior Convention, the US resident shareholder may elect to continue to apply the Prior Convention until 1 May 2004.
For US federal income tax purposes, the dividend paid and, if a US resident shareholder elects under the Prior Convention to claim a foreign tax credit with respect to the UK withholding, the associated Tax Credit Amount are includible in gross income by US resident shareholders and, for foreign tax credit limitation purposes, are foreign source income.
The UK withholding is treated as a foreign income tax which may, subject to certain limitations and restrictions, be eligible for credit against a US resident shareholders US federal income tax liability or deductible by such shareholders in computing their taxable income for a US resident shareholder who elects to include the associated Tax Credit Amount in income.
Subject to applicable limitations, dividends received by certain US resident non-corporate holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2009 may be subject to US federal income tax at a maximum rate of 15%.
US resident shareholders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether they are subject to any special rules which may not limit their ability to be taxed at this favourable rate.
Taxation on capital gains Under the Convention each contracting state may in general tax capital gains in accordance with the provisions of its domestic law.
Under present UK law, individuals who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in the UK, and companies which are not resident in the UK will not be liable to UK tax on capital gains made on the disposal of their Ordinary Shares or ADRs, unless such Ordinary Shares or ADRs are held in connection with a trade, profession or vocation carried on in the UK through a branch or agency.
A US resident shareholder will recognise capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes on the sale or exchange of Ordinary Shares or ADRs in the same manner as such a holder would on the sale or exchange of any other shares held as capital assets.
As a result, a US resident shareholder will generally recognise capital gain or loss for US federal income tax purposes equal to the difference between the amount realised and such holders adjusted basis in the Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
The gain or loss will generally be US source income or loss.
US resident shareholders should consult their own tax advisors about the treatment of capital gains, which may be taxed at lower rates than ordinary income for non-corporate taxpayers and capital losses, the deductibility of which may be limited.
AstraZeneca Annual Report and Shareholder Information 152 Form 20-F Information 2004 Shareholder Information continued UK inheritance tax Under the current Double Taxation Estates Convention the Estate Tax Convention between the US and the UK, Ordinary Shares or ADRs held by an individual shareholder who is domiciled for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention in the US, and is not for the purposes of the Estate Tax Convention a national of the UK, will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax on the individuals death or on a chargeable gift of the Ordinary Shares or ADRs during the individuals lifetime, provided that any applicable US federal gift or estate tax liability is paid, unless the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are part of the business property of a permanent establishment of the individual in the UK or, in the case of a shareholder who performs independent personal services, pertain to a fixed base situated in the UK.
Where the ADRs or Ordinary Shares have been placed in trust by a settlor who, at the time of settlement, was a US resident shareholder, the ADRs or Ordinary Shares will generally not be subject to UK inheritance tax unless the settlor, at the time of settlement, was not domiciled in the US and was a UK national.
In the exceptional case where the Ordinary Shares or ADRs are subject both to UK inheritance tax and US federal gift or estate tax, the Estate Tax Convention generally provides for double taxation to be relieved by means of credit relief.
Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders a There are no governmental laws, decrees or regulations in the UK restricting the import or export of capital or affecting the remittance of dividends, interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Ordinary Shares or ADRs.
However, a 1.5% stamp duty reserve tax is payable upon the deposit of Ordinary Shares in connection with the creation of, but not subsequent dealing in, ADRs.
This is in lieu of the normal 0.5% stamp duty on all purchases of Ordinary Shares.
b There are no limitations under English law or the Companys Memorandum and Articles of Association on the right of non-resident or foreign owners to be the registered holders of and to vote Ordinary Shares or to be registered holders of notes or debentures of Zeneca Wilmington Inc. or AstraZeneca PLC.

Except where otherwise indicated, figures included in this report relating to pharmaceutical product market sizes and market shares are obtained from syndicated industry sources, primarily IMS Health IMS, a market research firm internationally recognised by the pharmaceutical industry.
The 2004 market share figures included in this report are based primarily on data obtained from an online IMS database.
IMS data may differ from that compiled by the Group with respect to its own products.
Of particular significance in this regard are the following: 1 AstraZeneca publishes its financial results on a financial year and quarterly interim basis, whereas IMS issues its data on a monthly and quarterly basis: 2 the online IMS database is updated quarterly and uses the average exchange rates for the relevant quarter: 3 IMS data from the US is not adjusted for Medicaid and similar state rebates: and 4 IMS sales data are compiled using actual wholesaler data and data from statistically representative panels of retail and hospital pharmacies, which data are then projected by IMS to give figures for national markets.
References to prevalence of disease have been derived from a variety of sources and are not intended to be indicative of the current market or any potential market for AstraZenecas pharmaceutical products since, among other things, there may be no correlation between the prevalence of a disease and the number of individuals who are treated for such a disease.
