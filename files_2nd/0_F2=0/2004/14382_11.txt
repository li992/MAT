The principal schemes are in the United Kingdom and in the United States and are of the defined benefit type, with assets held in separate trustee-administered funds.
From 1 January 2004 the UK schemes introduced a new revalued career average benefit structure for new members.
Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualified actuaries.
The Group accounts for its pension and other post-retirement benefit costs, principally post-retirement healthcare, in accordance with FRS17 Retirement Benefits.
The most recent actuarial valuations of the two principal UK schemes were performed using the Projected Unit Method as at 31 March 2003 and 5 April 2003.
The most recent valuations of the principal US pension and post-retirement healthcare plans were performed at 1 January 2004.
These valuations have been updated by independent qualified actuaries for the purposes of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 July 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 July 2004.
Contributions to these schemes are made on the advice of the actuaries with the objective that the benefits be fully funded during the scheme members working lives.
The Group provides a defined contribution 401K plan for its USA employees.
The disclosures relate to all defined benefit retirement plans in the United Kingdom and the United States.
Defined benefit plans in other territories, most of which are unfunded, have net pension liabilities of 14.2m 2003 27.4m, including 12.5m for Polymer Sealing Solutions, sold in September 2003.
No additional disclosure is given in respect of these plans on grounds of their immateriality.
The principal assumptions used in updating the valuations are set out below.
The liability of the US post-retirement healthcare plans has been reduced by US$25m to allow for the federal subsidy, under the US Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, to sponsors of such plans that are actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. All US plans were in deficit at 31 July 2003 and 31 July 2004.

137.4 167.7 As previously reported, John Crane, Inc John Crane, a subsidiary of the Company, is one of many co-defendants in numerous law suits pending in the United States in which plaintiffs are claiming damages arising from exposure to, or use of, products containing asbestos.
The John Crane products generally referred to in these cases are ones in which the asbestos fibres were encapsulated in such a manner that, according to tests conducted on behalf of John Crane, the products were safe.
John Crane ceased manufacturing products containing asbestos in 1985.
John Crane has resisted every case in which it has been named and will continue its robust defence of all asbestos-related claims based upon this safe product defence.
In addition John Crane has access to insurance cover which, while it is kept under review, is judged sufficient to meet all material costs of defending these claims for the foreseeable future.
As a result of its defence policy, John Crane has been dismissed before trial from cases involving approximately 95,000 claims over the last 25 years.
John Crane is currently a defendant in cases involving approximately 180,000 claims.
Despite these large numbers of claims, John Crane has had final judgements against it, after losing appeals, in only 39 cases, amounting to awards of some US$26m over the 25-year period.
These awards, the related interest and all material defence costs have been met in full by insurance.
No provision relating to this litigation has been made in these accounts.
