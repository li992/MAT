Transactional exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operating unit involved.
The table below shows the Groups transactional currency exposures as at 31 December 2004.

g Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The following table provides a comparison by category of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 and 2003.
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument could be exchanged in an arms length transaction between informed and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale, and excludes accrued interest.
Where available, market values have been used to determine fair values.
Set out below the table is a summary of the methods and assumptions used for each category of financial instrument.
2004 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value 000 000 000 000 Primary financial instruments held or issued to finance the Groups operations: Short term borrowings 31,331 31,331 16,174 16,174 Long term borrowings 41,087 41,087 22,872 22,872 Other financial liabilities 14,759 14,759 27,244 27,244 Cash at bank and in hand 28,568 28,568 16,095 16,095 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate profile: Interest rate swaps 386 Derivative financial instruments held to hedge future currency exposures: Forward foreign currency contracts 1,296 58 2,739 58,609 57,699 50,137 47,456 Summary of methods and assumptions: Interest rate swap and forward currency contracts: Fair value is based on market price of comparable instruments at the balance sheet date.
Short-term loans, overdrafts and cash at bank: Fair value approximates to the carrying value because of the short maturity of these instruments.
Long-term bank loans and other financial liabilities: For floating rate financial liabilities fair value approximates to the carrying value as payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
The fixed rate financial liabilities as set out in note 31b, have been swapped to fixed rate from floating rate using interest rate swaps.
The fair value adjustment arising on these fixed rate liabilities is included within the fair value loss on interest rate swaps as described in the table above.
Discounting of cash flows has not been applied in the fair value calculations for long-term bank loans and other financial liabilities.
