The major schemes are of the funded defined benefit type.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The trustee of The Morgan Group Senior Staff Pension and Life Assurance Scheme SSS is Law Debenture MC Senior Pension Trust Corporation: the trustee of The Morgan Pension Scheme MPS is Morgan Crucible Pension Trustees Limited, both of which are wholly owned subsidiary undertakings of The Law Debenture Pension Trust Corporation Plc.
Both have been trustees of the UK schemes since 1986.
Neither of the UK schemes holds any shares in the Company or any of its subsidiary undertakings, has loaned or will loan any scheme assets to the Company or its subsidiary undertakings or made or will make any cash loan to the Company or its subsidiary undertakings.
The total pension cost for the Group was 17.4 million 2003: 21.6 million of which 10.7 million 2003: 15.4 million relates to the overseas schemes.
The pension cost relating to the UK schemes, The MPS and The SSS is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
The latest actuarial valuations of The MPS and The SSS were on 6 April 2004 and 1 April 2004 respectively.
At those dates the market values of the assets of the two schemes were 140.0 million and 74.0 million respectively and the actuarial values of the assets were sufficient to cover 81% of the benefits that had accrued to members of The MPS and 100% of the benefits that had accrued to members of The SSS after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The average annual assumptions used for calculating the pension cost under SSAP 24 are: MPS SSS Investment return 7.0% 6.8% Pay increases 4.0% 5.0% Retail Price Index increases 3.0% 3.0% The Group operates approximately 70 overseas schemes with some 25% of these schemes being defined contribution schemes.
Most of the defined benefit schemes are operated in the USA, Italy and Germany.
A review of the major overseas schemes was carried out during 2004 and no material surpluses, or unprovided deficiencies on a current funding level, were identified which required adjustment in the accounts.
The charge to the profit and loss account in respect of the overseas schemes has been determined in accordance with SSAP 24 or local best practice.
Where local best practice is followed the resulting charge is not materially different from SSAP 24.
The disclosure requirements under FRS 17 are in note 30.
Four of the US subsidiary undertakings provide post retirement medical care to former employees.
These costs are accounted for on an accruals basis with the estimated actuarial liability being amortised over the average life of the relevant employees.
The cost for the year was 0.3 million 2003: 0.3 million.
The estimated actuarial liability is 1.3 million 2003: 1.6 million.
28 Guarantees and contingent liabilities Guarantees by The Morgan Crucible Company plc have been given for bank facilities of subsidiary undertakings totalling 68.3 million 2003: 86.6 million of which 68.2 million 2003: 86.6 million have been utilised.

There are contingent liabilities on bills discounted by the Group amounting to 1.1 million 2003: 0.2 million.
The Group has been subject to legal claims in the US and Canada.
Settlements for the majority of these have been agreed in 2004, and provided for.
These settlements are subject to court approval at year end.
The Board, having taken legal advice, are of the opinion that the remainder of these actions will not have a material impact on the Groups financial position.
In an international Group a variety of claims arise from time to time.
Provision has been made in these accounts against those claims which the Directors consider meet the requirements of FRS 12 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and are likely to result in significant liabilities.
29 Related parties The Directors have reviewed transactions with related parties as defined in FRS 8 Related Party Disclosures and have concluded that there are no material transactions which require disclosure which have not been acknowledged elsewhere in the Annual Report and Accounts.
