DIMENSION DATA 59 notes to the financial statements 1.
Basis of Preparation The Dimension Data Group the Group comprises Dimension Data Holdings plc the Company and its subsidiaries.
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, modified to include the revaluation of certain investments, and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom financial and accounting standards.
Prior year comparatives UITF Abstract 38 - Accounting for ESOP Trusts has been adopted and comparative financial information has been restated as necessary.
The impact of adopting Abstract 38 was to increase the total loss for the year ended 30 September 2003 by US$91,000.
This had no effect on reported earnings per share.
Equity shareholders funds have been reduced at 30 September 2003 by US$219,000.
The comparative balance sheet and cash flow statement have been restated.
Amounts due from and to taxation authorities have been separately categorised between debtors and creditors.
At 30 September 2003, debtors increased by US$36.1 million and creditors reduced by the same amount.
Accounting Policies Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries and its share of associates.
The results of subsidiaries are included from the effective dates of acquisition until the effective dates of disposal.
All significant intragroup transactions and balances have been eliminated on consolidation.
Turnover Turnover comprises the aggregate amounts receivable for the sale of goods and the amounts receivable from customers for the provision of services for installation, maintenance and call centre operations.
Maintenance revenue and licence fees Maintenance revenue and licence fees are recognised over the relevant contract periods.
Research and development Research and development costs are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Goodwill Where an investment in a subsidiary, joint venture or associated company is made, any difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the attributable net assets is recognised as goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was set off against reserves in the year of acquisition.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 October 1998 is recognised within intangible fixed assets in the year of acquisition, and amortised.
Amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis so as to write off the goodwill over its economic life, depending on the nature of the acquisition, for a period not exceeding five years.
The unamortised balance is reviewed on a regular basis and, if an impairment in value has occurred, it is written off in the period in which the circumstances have been identified.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 60 notes to the financial statements Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates considered appropriate to reduce their book values to estimated residual values over the useful lives of the assets.
The following rates are applied: Leasehold land, buildings and improvements over the lease term Computer and workshop equipment 20-33.33% per annum Motor vehicles 25% per annum Office furniture and equipment 10% per annum.
Associated companies Associated companies are those companies, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exercises significant influence and in which it holds a long term equity interest.
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method, from the date they became investees, whereby the Groups share of the associated companies retained income for the year is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
Attributable earnings or losses, less dividends received, are included with the book value of the investment in the consolidated balance sheet.
Provision is made where there has been an impairment in the carrying value of the investment.
Investments Investments, other than investments in associates and joint ventures, are reflected at the lower of cost and fair value in the balance sheet.
Fair value for unquoted investments represents the Directors valuation after taking into account any impairment.
Fair value of quoted investments represents market value.
Investments held by Protocol are stated at valuation in terms of the standards endorsed by the British Venture Capital Association.
Valuations, for unquoted investments, are based on arms length transactions which took place and valuation surpluses or losses included in operating income.
Where no such transaction took place, the investment is assessed for impairment and any valuation losses written off to operating income.
No account is taken of valuation surpluses indicated by the impairment review.
In the case of listed investments, the quoted share price at year end is used to value the investment.
All subsidiaries of Protocol are consolidated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Investments in subsidiaries are carried in the parent company balance sheet at cost less provisions for permanent impairment.
Accounting for foreign investments The balance sheets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries, together with investments in overseas associated undertakings, are translated into US dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The results of overseas subsidiaries and associated undertakings are translated at the weighted average rates of exchange for the year.
The exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the opening net investment and profit for the financial year at the closing rate, are taken to reserves.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of the weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Redundant and slow-moving stocks are identified and written down with regard to their estimated economic or realisable values.
DIMENSION DATA 61 notes to the financial statements Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Foreign currency transactions Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currencies at the rates of exchange on the dates of the transactions or, if hedged, at the rates of exchange under the related forward exchange contracts.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year, or if hedged, at the forward contract rates.
The exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Operating leases Rentals are charged to the profit and loss account over the lease term.
Pensions Pension costs in the profit and loss account comprise contributions payable to the Groups various defined contribution schemes.
Reporting currency As permitted by UK Company law, the Group reports in US dollars, the currency in which a significant amount of its business is conducted and which is regarded as its functional currency.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 62 annual financial statements 3.
The net operating assets thereof have been included in the relevant geographical region.
Net operating assets are total net assets excluding convertible bonds, loans and minority interests.
Turnover by destination is not materially different to turnover by origin.
The Directors consider that they operate one generic class of business and that business is primarily managed regionally.

g Includes profit on sale of Proxicom and the write-down of the investment in Sunset Learning.
Also included is a profit on sale of a 1.51% interest in Dimension Data South Africa Pty Ltd, offset by the cost of a further 1.1%, which vested during the period.
A deferred tax asset amounting to US$13.7 million, previously carried on the balance sheet in Africa, has been reversed.
Delays in certain corporate finance initiatives, which would have assisted with the realisation of this asset, have led the Directors to the view that the recovery of this asset in the near future is uncertain.
In 2003, the Group revised the useful economic life of its goodwill from seven to five years and incurred an accelerated amortisation charge as a result.
A component of this 2003 charge related to goodwill arising from Datacraft Asia acquisitions, but no adjustment was made to the Groups 2003 earnings to reflect the outside shareholders share of this charge.
Datacraft Asia has amortised and impaired this goodwill in its 2004 results and therefore the outside shareholders component of the expense amounting to US$7.2 million has been reflected as exceptional in our results for the year ended 30 September 2004.

Floating rate balances relate to bank loans, overdrafts and loans.
Interest is based on the relevant interbank rate.
The non-interest bearing financial liabilities relate to deferred consideration in respect of acquisitions which will be paid in either cash or shares at the discretion of the purchaser.
Such amounts are mainly due for settlement on demand or within one year of the balance sheet date.

These contracts were entered into to cover foreign commitments not yet due.
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of these forward exchange contracts.
DIMENSION DATA 87 annual financial statements 28.
Financial Instruments Continued 28 d Hedging The Groups policy is to hedge all material transactional currency exposure.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
There were no speculative positions in foreign currencies at the year ends, and there were no material gains or losses from such positions for any period presented.
The Group enters into forward exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure arising on sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies as soon as there is a firm contractual commitment.
It also uses interest rate swaps to manage its interest rate profile.
An analysis of the unrecognised gains and losses is as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses $'000 $'000 $'000 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 October 2003 26 3,663 3,637 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised this year 26 3,663 3,637 Gains and losses arising before 1 October 2003 that were not recognised in the year - - - Gains and losses arising in the year to 30 September 2004 that were not recognised in that year 414 1,126 712 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 30 September 2004 expected to be recognised in the year to 30 September 2005 414 1,126 712 28 e Currency profile The main functional currency of the Group is the US dollar, being the currency in which the majority of purchases are denominated and to which most of the selling prices are linked.
Other major currencies are the South African rand, Sterling, Australian dollar, Singapore dollar and the Euro.
Monetary assets and liabilities are generally economically hedged and therefore there are limited transactional exposures which would give rise to net currency gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
Pension Schemes In most countries, the employing company provides either defined contribution or insured retirement plans to their employees.
The relevant company, and in some cases the employees, pay regular contributions to the plans.
Once contributions are made, the relevant company has no liability in respect of these plans.
Pension costs are disclosed in Note 6.
Employees in France, Japan and Korea are entitled to lump-sum termination indemnity payments upon leaving.
Provisions have been established in respect of these liabilities.
ANNUAL REPORT 2004 88 annual financial statements 30.
Related-party Transactions Related parties are entities with common direct or indirect shareholders and or directors.
The principal shareholders of the Group are listed on page 51.
The Group and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sale, purchase, service and investment transactions with associates and others in which the Group has an interest.
These transactions are under terms that are no more favourable than those arranged with third parties.
There were no significant related-party transactions during the current year which require disclosure.
Subsequent Event On 16 November 2004 Dimension Data served notice of exercise of a call option to acquire the bare dominium freehold over the Campus property, to be settled by a cash payment of US$4.6 million.
This will result in the Group having full title to the Campus at the end of the property lease in 2018.
This is currently accounted for as an operating lease.
From the date of exercise of the call option, this will be accounted for as a finance lease, whereby the asset and liability will be capitalised and depreciation and finance costs will be charged through the profit and loss account.
The finance lease liability will be capitalised at fair value of US$135.0 million, based on a lending rate of 16.9% per annum.
The land and buildings will be capitalised at the cost of the debt of US$135.0 million plus the cost of acquiring the bare dominium of US$4.6 million.
Furthermore, the assets will be subject to an impairment review.
The Directors estimate that the assets will be impaired by US$16.6 million, and an amount of approximately US$17.0 million released against the Campus provision established in 2004.
The balance of the provisions raised in 2003 and 2004 for impaired leasehold improvements and third-party tenant costs will remain in place.
