Environmental and legal liabilities include known legal claims and environmental liabilities where the costs and timing of any payment is inherently uncertain.
Included in this provision is an amount of 27.9 million 2003: 26.2 million related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies.
This liability is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in Other debtors note 13 in line with FRS 12 Provisions, contingencies and contingent assets.
The liability has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2004 based on advice from independent professional advisors.
The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term US treasury rate of 5%.
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future.

Financial instruments The Group held the following categories of financial instruments as at 31 July 2004: Book value Fair value m m Financial instruments held to fund the Groups operations Short-term borrowings 384.0 384.0 Loans and other borrowings payable after one year 854.9 854.9 Cash and deposits 291.3 291.3 Construction loans receivable 187.7 187.7 Construction loans payable 187.7 187.7 Current asset investments 6.2 6.2 Lease termination provisions 1.3 1.1 Financial instruments held to manage the Groups interest rate and currency profile Interest rate swaps 1.0 Short-term currency swaps 0.4 For the purpose of the previous table, the fair values of short-term borrowings, cash and deposits, construction loans payable and current asset investments, approximate book value due to their short maturities.
The loans and other borrowings payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based on 6 month LIBOR.
Thus the fair value of these instruments as at 31 July 2004 also approximates to their book value.
The fair value of construction loans receivable approximates to book value as the interest rates attaching to these loans reflect a market risk premium.
Sterling cash and deposits are utilised to reduce currency borrowings through the use of short-term currency swaps.

Financial instruments continued To determine the fair value of currency and interest rate swaps for inclusion in the above table, a calculation was made of the net gain or loss which would have arisen if these contracts had been terminated on 31 July 2004.
At 31 July 2004, unrecognised gains and losses on forward exchange contracts taken out as hedges of sales and purchase transactions were not significant.
The Groups policies in respect of foreign currency and interest risk management and the related use of financial instruments are set out in the treasury section of the operating and financial review on pages 33 and 34 and form part of these financial statements.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Groups operations are excluded from the above disclosures other than those relating to assets and liabilities by currency.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits United Kingdom The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The plans retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees of 5% of earnings with the balance being paid by Group companies.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent consulting actuary.
An independent actuarial valuation was last carried out on 1 May 2001.
On that date the market value of the plans assets was 350.5 million.
The market value of the assets was 105% of accrued benefits, after allowing for increases in earnings and pensions in payment.
The normal cost to the Company was 14.4% of pensionable earnings.
The financial assumptions used were based on gilt and bond yields as at the valuation date.
The principal actuarial assumptions used were an investment return of 6.5% per annum before retirement and an investment return of 5.5% per annum after retirement, future salary increases of 5% or 6% per annum and increases to pensions in payment of 2.5% per annum.
The total charge to the profit and loss account for UK companies was 13.5 million 2003: 12.3 million.
The Group is in the process of finalising the triennial actuarial valuation as at 1 May 2004 of the UK scheme.
It is expected that it will give rise to an incremental profit and loss charge under SSAP 24 of approximately 6 million in the year to 31 July 2005.
North America The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, details of which are set out below.
In addition, the Group operates three defined benefit schemes in the United States.
In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated.
The majority of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Defined contribution plans Defined contribution plans are established in accordance with US 401k rules.
Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit sharing plans.
Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due.
In the year to 31 July 2004 the cost of defined contribution plans charged to the profit and loss account was 14.3 million 2003: 10.7 million.
Defined benefit plans Defined benefit plans are operated by three US subsidiary undertakings and Wolseley Canada.
Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded: two plans are closed to new entrants.
The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan.
The remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit credit Method as agreed with independent consulting actuaries.
The independent actuaries have reported on the assets and liabilities of the plans at 31 July 2002.
The principal actuarial assumptions were based upon investment returns of 7%7.5% and future salary increases of 4%.
The obligations are discounted at 7%.
The fair value of the assets of the funded plans amounted to 44.0 million.
The market value of the assets was 81.3% of the accrued benefits.
Surpluses and deficits revealed by the valuation are being amortised over the expected remaining service lives of members.
The total profit and loss account charge for North American schemes was 3.1 million 2003: 2.7 million.
Other territories Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated.
Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with actuarial advice.
Full provision is made for such liabilities in these accounts.
Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period in which they fall due.
The cost of other defined contribution and defined benefit schemes charged to the profit and loss account was 4.5 million 2003: 2.7 million.
Post retirement health care There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.
