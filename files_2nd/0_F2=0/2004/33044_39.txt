Awards under the BSRP and the LTIP will normally be satisfied by the transfer of shares to participants by the trustees of the Cadbury Schweppes Employee Trust the Employee Trust.
The Employee Trust is a general discretionary trust whose beneficiaries include employees and former employees of the Group, and their dependants.
The principal purpose of the Employee Trust is to encourage and facilitate the holding of shares in the Company by or for the benefit of employees of the Group.
The Employee Trust may be used in conjunction with any of the Groups employee share plans.
In January 1997, the Company established an additional employee trust, the Cadbury Schweppes plc Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust the QUEST, for the purpose of distributing ordinary shares in the Company on the exercise of options under the UK Savings-Related Share Option Scheme.
The trustee of the QUEST is Cadbury Schweppes Group Trustees Ltd, a subsidiary of the Company.
All employees of Group companies in the UK, including Executive Directors of the Company, are potential beneficiaries under the QUEST.
The options held by each Director holding office at the year end are detailed in the Report on Directors Remuneration on page 45.
There were no options held by them under the Irish Share Plan see below.
The Cadbury Schweppes Irish Employee Share Scheme the Irish Share Plan In the last three years, 5 appropriations under the Irish Share Plan a profit sharing plan totalling 61,985 ordinary shares, have been made to eligible employees.
The prices at which the shares will vest, between 31 May 2005 and 23 December 2007, range from 3.19 to 4.69.
31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Accounting Differences The financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applicable in the UK UK GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from those applicable in the US US GAAP.
The following is a summary of the adjustments to consolidated profit for the financial year and consolidated shareholders funds that would have been required in applying the significant differences between UK and US GAAP.

From 1998, under UK GAAP, acquired goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement via annual impairment review or annual amortisation charge is determined based on the individual circumstances of each business acquired.
A portion of the goodwill capitalised from 1998 related to associates, is not being amortised under UK GAAP see Note 1.
For the purposes of US GAAP, all goodwill written off against reserves under UK GAAP has been reinstated as an asset on the balance sheet.
Under US GAAP, for periods ending on or before 30 December 2001 goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life, not to exceed 40 years.
Under US GAAP, effective 31 December 2001, the Group adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
The statement directs that goodwill not be amortised but rather be tested at least annually for impairment.
The Group carries out an annual impairment review of goodwill.
Impairment reviews are carried out at the reporting unit level, which are sub-divisions of the Companys five reporting segments.
The impairment review process compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including the associated goodwill.
The fair value of each reporting unit is valued using a discounted cash flow methodology and the Company makes assumptions and estimates regarding future turnover growth, estimated costs, marketing costs and economic factors in arriving at the fair value.
These cash flows are discounted at rates that management estimate to be the risk affected average cost of capital for the particular businesses.
The estimates are based on historical data, various internal estimates and a variety of external sources and are developed as part of the long term planning process.
If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value, the Company performs an additional step to calculate the total amount of the goodwill impairment.
This second step involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit including any unrecognised intangible assets.
An impairment charge is recognised to the extent that the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds any residual unallocated fair value.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 151 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued a Goodwill continued The following table provides a reconciliation of the Groups US GAAP goodwill during 2004: Americas Americas EMEA Europe Asia Beverages Confectionery Beverages Pacific Total m m m m m m Book value at beginning of year 1,054 1,034 644 378 350 3,460 Exchange rate adjustments 69 35 15 4 20 105 Goodwill acquired 7 26 18 51 Adjustments pursuant to completion of purchase price allocation 9 7 1 1 2 Book value at end of year 976 1,006 667 408 347 3,404 In 2004, no impairments 2003: 12 million, 2002: 14 million were recorded under US GAAP.
b Intangible assets Under UK GAAP, the cost of brands acquired may be capitalised and, if the life of the asset is deemed to be indefinite, no amortisation or writedown is required unless there is an impairment in value below cost.
On an annual basis, the Group reviews non-amortised identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment using an estimate of the related discounted cash flows in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.
Under US GAAP, for periods ending on or before 30 December 2001 identifiable intangible assets were amortised on a straight-line basis over the useful economic life, not to exceed 40 years.
Identifiable intangible assets were evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicated that, in managements judgement, the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable.
Impairments of identifiable intangible assets were recognised if expected undiscounted cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the asset.
If a material impairment was identified, the asset was written down to its estimated fair value.
Fair value was determined based on the present value of expected net cash flows to be generated, discounted using a rate commensurate with the risks involved.
The statement directs that intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortised but rather be tested at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortised over their useful lives, but without the constraint of an arbitrary ceiling.
The following table provides a reconciliation of the Groups US GAAP intangible assets during 2004: Other Indefinite Definite definite life life brands life brands intangibles Total m m m m Cost at beginning of year 3,420 25 264 3,709 Accumulated amortisation at beginning of year 306 2 20 328 Book value at beginning of year 3,114 23 244 3,381 Exchange rate adjustments 151 12 15 178 Reallocation to definite life brands 10 10 Reallocation from goodwill Acquisitions Amortisation 6 27 33 Book value at end of year 2,953 15 202 3,170 152 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 The book value at the end of the year is analysed below: Other Indefinite Definite definite life life brands life brands intangibles Total m m m m Cost at end of year 3,241 23 242 3,506 Accumulated amortisation at end of year 288 8 40 336 Book value at end of year 2,953 15 202 3,170 The weighted average amortisation period for the definite life intangibles is 20 years 2003: 20 years, 2002: n a.
The total amortisation charge expected under US GAAP in 2005 is 27 million.
As a consequence of the pattern of the amortisation applied this annual charge will fall in each of the following four years, to be approximately 20 million in 2009.
The principal component of other definite life intangibles relates to customer relationships.
c Business combinations During 2003, the Group acquired Adams for a consideration of 2.7 billion see Note 23.
Under UK GAAP the Group recognised intangible assets of 1.0 billion and goodwill of 1.4 billion on acquisition.
Determination of fair value Under UK GAAP, where it is not possible to complete the determination of fair values by the date on which the first postacquisition financial statements are approved, a provisional assessment of fair values is made and any adjustments required to those provisional fair values, and the corresponding adjustments to goodwill, are incorporated in the financial statements for the first full annual accounting period following the acquisition.
As explained in Note 23 the fair value adjustments for UK GAAP are stated on a provisional basis.
Under US GAAP, adjustments are likewise permitted subsequent to consummation of the acquisition, but the allocation period should usually not exceed one year from the consummation of a business combination.
Fair value of stock acquired Under UK GAAP, stock acquired through a business combination is valued at the lower of replacement cost and net realisable value.
Under US GAAP, stock acquired through a business combination reflects the selling price less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable element of profit for the selling effort by the acquiring company.
Consequently the fair value of stock acquired with Adams under US GAAP was in excess of that held for UK GAAP by 53 million.
Restructuring and integration costs On the acquisition of a business, certain costs of reorganising the acquired business are required to be taken to the profit and loss account under UK GAAP, but are treated as liabilities assumed at the acquisition date and recognised as a fair value adjustment to goodwill under US GAAP.
The total costs recognised in the profit and loss account post acquisition that have been treated as liabilities assumed at the acquisition date with Adams amounts to 32 million.
These liabilities were fully utilised either in 2003 or 2004.
Other intangible assets Under UK GAAP, intangible assets are recognised in a business combination only if it can be disposed of separately without disposing of a business of the entity.
The separability criteria is a key component of the definition of intangibles under UK GAAP.
As such, under UK GAAP, intangibles such as contractual and non-contractual customer relationships are not permitted to be recognised separately from goodwill, primarily because of the lack of separability.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 153 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued c Business combinations continued Under US GAAP, an intangible asset in a business combination should be recognised i if it arises from contractual rights or other legal rights regardless of whether those rights are transferable or separable from the acquired entity or from other legal rights or obligations or ii it is capable of being separated or divided from the acquired entity and sold, transferred, licensed, rented or otherwise exchanged.
Customer relationships, valued at 257 million, acquired with Adams meet the definition of an intangible asset under US GAAP but not UK GAAP.
Consequently, these customer relationships have been transferred from goodwill to intangibles for the purposes of US GAAP reporting.
Details of the acquisition of Adams during 2003 are set out in Note 23.
Under SFAS 141, supplemental pro forma disclosures for the Group are required, as though this acquisition had occurred at the beginning of 2003.
These disclosures have been prepared under US GAAP and are set out below: 2003 m Turnover 6,689 Net income 318 Net income per ADS 0.63 The Group does not believe that this pro forma disclosure should be regarded as indicative of the ongoing results of the Group or of Adams.
Unaudited estimated profit after tax for Adams in 2002, on a US GAAP basis, was 95 million.
For the period from 1 January 2003 to 30 March 2003, Adams recorded a profit after tax, on a US GAAP basis, of 11 million.
The tax rate used is based on local tax rates for the respective year.
d Interest capitalisation Under UK GAAP, the capitalisation of interest is optional and the Group does not capitalise such interest.
Under US GAAP interest is required to be capitalised on capital construction projects and amortised over the life of the asset.
The amount of interest capitalised for US GAAP purposes was 7 million 2002: 6 million, 2001: 7 million.
e Derivative instruments Under UK GAAP, to qualify as a hedge, a financial instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or to a firm commitment or anticipated transaction.
Gains and losses on hedges of existing assets or liabilities are included in the carrying amounts of those assets or liabilities and are ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account as part of those carrying amounts.
Gains and losses on qualifying hedges of firm commitments or anticipated transactions are also deferred and are recognised in the profit and loss account or as adjustments of carrying amounts when the hedged transaction occurs.
Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on financial instruments that do not qualify as hedges are recognised as other income or expense.
If a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any gains or losses are recognised as other income or expense.
Prior to 1 January 2001 under US GAAP, hedging of foreign currency transactions was allowable for transactions which were firm commitments.
Some of the Groups foreign currency contracts which hedge forecast or budgeted transactions did not meet the definition of a firm commitment: gains or losses on these contracts were not deferred and were recognised in net income.
Under US GAAP, SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities has been applied as of 1 January 2001.
This standard establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and used for hedging activities.
All derivatives, whether designated for hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has not designated its derivative instruments as hedges pursuant to SFAS 133.
All contracts are marked to market at the balance sheet date and gains or losses arising are recognised in net income.
154 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 In connection with the purchasing of cocoa, sugar, and certain other products for anticipated manufacturing requirements, the Group enters into commodities futures contracts as deemed appropriate to reduce the effect of price fluctuations.
Under UK GAAP, these futures contracts meet the hedge criteria and are accounted for as hedges.
Accordingly, gains and losses related to the fluctuation of the price of these contracts are deferred and recognised in cost of sales as part of the product cost, when the goods are sold.
Under US GAAP the Group has not designated its futures contracts as hedges.
Under US GAAP the fair value of these derivative items are recognised as an asset or a liability as appropriate, with movements in these fair values being recognised immediately within net income.
The adoption of SFAS 133 in 2001 resulted in a net cumulative transition adjustment of 41 million net of 18 million tax, of which 15 million has been dealt with as a cumulative adjustment to net income during 2001.
Of the cumulative adjustment to shareholders funds, 1 million 2003: nil, 2002: 1 million released has been charged to the profit and loss account during the current year.
f Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax liabilities related to temporary differences differences between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their corresponding tax basis are fully provided and future taxation benefits are recognised as deferred tax assets to the extent that their realisation is more likely than not.
Under UK GAAP, FRS 19 requires deferred tax to be provided in full on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date to the extent that they result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
In certain circumstances where it is expected to take some time for tax losses to be relieved, it may not be appropriate to recognise the deferred tax assets at all.
FRS 19 does not define or provide guidance relating to the phrases some time or more likely than not.
Under US GAAP, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for the estimated future tax consequences of events attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating and capital loss and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets are reduced through the establishment of a valuation allowance at such time as, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than 50% that the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
This may result in deferred tax assets being recognised for US GAAP which do not comply with the UK GAAP criteria.
Under UK GAAP deferred tax is based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted.
For US GAAP only tax rates and laws that have been enacted are taken into account.
This difference has not resulted in material differences in 2004, 2003 and 2002.
Under UK GAAP, passing certain criteria, the Group may net deferred tax liabilities and assets and present a net balance in the balance sheet, within Provisions for liabilities and charges.
Additionally, under UK GAAP the tax rate reconciliation is performed to the current tax charge for the year.
Under US GAAP deferred taxes are classified between current and non-current portion, depending on the items they relate to, disclosed separately and presented on a net basis, by tax jurisdiction.
Additionally, under US GAAP the tax rate reconciliation is performed to the total tax charge for the year.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 155 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued f Deferred taxation continued The table below relates the UK Corporation Tax rate applicable in each year to the effective rate obtained by computing the total tax charge as a percentage of profit on ordinary activities before tax, under UK GAAP.

Hence under UK GAAP no immediate deferred tax is provided for the difference between the accounting and tax cost basis for acquired identifiable intangible assets or goodwill.
Under US GAAP deferred tax is provided by reference to differences between the accounting book value and tax cost basis, a balance sheet approach.
As a consequence under US GAAP deferred tax liabilities of 157 million 2003: 131 million: 2002: 57 million have been recognised in respect of identifiable intangible assets and tax deductible goodwill.
156 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 g Revaluation of properties Under UK GAAP, properties were, up to 1999, restated on the basis of appraised values in financial statements prepared in all other respects in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Such restatements are not permitted under US GAAP.
h Ordinary dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary dividends are provided in the financial statements on the basis of the recommendation by the Directors which requires subsequent approval by the shareholders to become a legal obligation of the Company.
Under US GAAP, dividends are only provided when the legal obligation to pay arises.
i Retirement benefits Under UK GAAP, the costs of providing pension benefits may be calculated by the use of any recognised actuarial method which is appropriate and whose assumptions reflect the long-term nature of the assets and liabilities involved.
Under US GAAP, the costs of providing these benefits are calculated using the projected unit credit method and a discount rate being the rate of interest at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled which reflects current market rates.
In addition, under US GAAP, a minimum pension liability is recognised, as a component of other comprehensive income, in certain circumstances when there is a deficit of plan assets relative to the accumulated benefit obligations.
The major retirement plans as detailed in Note 18, are reviewed in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standard SFAS 87 annually and the disclosures below have been presented in accordance with SFAS 132.
Where appropriate, additional pension charges in respect of curtailment or settlement events have been calculated in accordance with SFAS 88.
Post retirement medical benefit plans are assessed annually for materiality.
Amounts for these plans were not material and consequently have not been separately disclosed.
The net periodic pension cost for the major plans under SFAS 87 and SFAS 88 was made up as follows: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Service cost 72 67 49 Employee contributions 9 9 7 Interest cost 110 102 97 Expected return on assets 111 112 114 Amortisation of prior year service cost 1 1 Amortisation of transitional amount 3 3 Recognition of actuarial gain loss 14 7 4 Curtailments settlements 8 76 67 25 2004 2003 2002 m m m The US GAAP amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements were: Prepaid benefit cost 23 31 40 Accrued benefit liability 272 231 203 249 200 163 Intangible asset 91111 Accumulated other comprehensive income 120 94 112 Net amount recognised 120 95 40 For the purposes of amortising gains and losses, the 10% corridor has been adopted, and the market-related value of assets recognises realised and unrealised capital gains and losses over a rolling three year period.
The weighted average assumptions used across the major pensions plans at the end of the financial year and used to determine the benefit obligations were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 %%% Discount rate 5.4 5.6 5.7 Long-term rate of return on assets 7.4 7.4 7.1 Earnings increase 4.4 4.4 4.3 Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 157 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued i Retirement benefits continued The movement in the benefit obligation and plan assets was as follows: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Benefit Obligation At beginning of year 2,007 1,754 1,548 Other additional plans 12 9 16 Acquisitions disposals 91 Exchange rate adjustments 15 6 Service cost 63 59 42 Interest cost 110 101 97 Actuarial gain loss 100 79 124 Amendments 3 2 Benefits paid 99 85 76 Curtailment settlements 8 Employee contributions 11 9 8 Expenses and tax paid 1 2 1 At end of year 2,185 2,007 1,754 Plan Assets At beginning of year 1,596 1,380 1,575 Other additional plans 4 12 15 Acquisitions disposals 2 50 Exchange rate adjustments 6 10 4 Actual return on plan assets 178 188 177 Benefits paid 99 85 76 Curtailment settlements 11 Employer contributions 49 44 32 Employee contributions 11 10 8 Expenses and tax paid 1 2 1 At end of year 1,734 1,596 1,380 Funded status 451 411 374 Unrecognised prior service cost 4 7 8 Unrecognised transition amount 3 Unrecognised net actuarial loss gain 323 301 323 Amount contributed to plan during fourth quarter 4 8 Accrued Prepaid cost 120 95 40 The aggregate funded status of pension plans can be analysed as follows: For plans with Projected Benefit Obligation in excess of plan assets Aggregate Projected Benefit Obligation 2,108 1,985 1,744 Aggregate fair value of plan assets 1,650 1,571 1,369 The aggregate figures for plans in which the Accumulated Benefit Obligation exceeds plan assets can be analysed as follows: Aggregate Accumulated Benefit Obligation 1,871 1,735 1,422 Aggregate fair value of plan assets 1,639 1,565 1,228 158 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 UK pension scheme disclosures The UK pension scheme accounts for over 70% of the total Groups total benefit obligations.
The Trustees of the main UK Scheme have three key investment objectives to guide them in their strategic management of the Funds assets.
The acquisition of appropriate assets, which will generate income and capital growth and which together with new contributions from both members and the Group, will meet the cost of current and future benefits provided by the Fund.
To limit the risk of the assets failing to meet the liabilities over the long term and in relation to the statutory UK Minimum Funding Requirement MFR.
c. To minimise the long term costs of the Fund by maximising the return on the assets, whilst having regard to the objective under b above.
The Trustees seek to achieve these objectives through investing in a mixture of real and monetary assets.
In so doing, they recognise that returns on real assets, while expected to be greater over the long term than those on monetary assets, are likely to be more volatile.
A mixture across asset classes should provide the level of returns required by the Fund to meet its liabilities at an acceptable level of risk for the Trustees and an acceptable level of cost to the Group.
In 2003, the Trustees undertook an asset and liability modelling exercise ALM with the assistance of the main UK schemes actuary.
The ALM looked at a number of different investment scenarios and projected both a range and a best estimate of likely returns from each one, from which the Trustees determined the structure they feel most comfortable with.
The long-term asset allocation deemed appropriate to meet the Trustees objectives following this review was as follows: Equities 60% Bonds 25% Property 10% Other, including private equity 5% The breakdown of the market value of the main UK Schemes assets and the rate of return assumption applied in calculating the net benefit cost under US GAAP split between the different asset categories are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Share of Share of Share of assets assets assets %%% Equities 61% 65% 60% Bonds 26% 22% 24% Property 8% 8% 9% Other, including private equity 5% 5% 7% 100% 100% 100% The expected rate of return assumptions have been determined following consultation with the Groups local actuarial advisers.
The Group has taken direct account of the actual investment strategy of the associated pension schemes and expected rates of return on the different asset classes held.
In the case of bond investments, the rates assumed have been directly based on market redemption yields at the measurement date, whilst those on other asset classes represent forwardlooking rates that have typically been based on other independent research by investment specialists.
The assumptions that were used in calculating the benefit obligation and net benefit cost for US GAAP purposes for the main UK scheme were: As at As at 30 September 30 September 2004 2003 % pa % pa Discount rate 5.5 5.5 Long-term asset return 7.4 7.3 Earnings increases 4.5 4.5 Pension increases 2.7 2.5 Under US GAAP the measurement date used for pension accounting is 30 September 2004.
The current best estimate of cash payments to be made into the main UK scheme for 2005 is 19 million 2004: 15 million.
The Accumulated Benefit Obligation of the main UK Scheme as at 30 September 2004 amounted to 1,458 million 2003: 1,313 million.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 159 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued i Retirement benefits continued The current best estimate of future benefit payments to members of the UK scheme after 2 January 2005 are set out below: Annual payments m 2005 62 2006 65 2007 68 2008 70 2009 73 Aggregate for financial years 2010 to 2014 415 Overseas disclosures The Group has a number of overseas pension plans, the most significant of which are those in the USA, Canada, Australia and Ireland.
The detail of the investment objectives of the schemes within these countries varies from plan to plan however the overall objectives are similar to those of the UK scheme.
The breakdown of the market value of the overseas schemes assets and the rate of return assumptions applied in calculating the net benefit cost under US GAAP split between the different asset categories are as follows: 2004 Share of assets % Equities 67% Bonds 20% Property 7% Other 6% 100% The expected rate of return assumption has been determined in a manner consistent with that used by the UK scheme.
The assumptions that were used in calculating the benefit obligation and net benefit cost for US GAAP purposes for the overseas schemes were not significantly different to either those used for the UK scheme or the Group as a whole.
The Group has a number of post retirement medical benefit plans, principally in the US and Canada.
The assumed health care cost trend rates for 2005 are 10%, grading down to 5% over a periods between 10 and five years.
The effect of a 1% increase and decrease on the service and interest component of the net period service cost and the accumulated benefit obligations for these schemes would not be significant.
j SAYE discounts Under UK GAAP, there is no charge related to the discount offered on SAYE shares.
Under US GAAP, the discount on each scheme has to be amortised over the life of the scheme.
k LTIP Under UK GAAP, the costs of LTIP schemes are amortised based on the market value of shares at the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, these plans are accounted for as variable plans and the cost is calculated based on the market price of shares at the date of award, however, for those schemes where the measurement period has not yet been completed so no award has been made, the cost is based on the year-end share price.
The cumulative unutilised charge for these schemes is taken as a deduction from shareholders funds under US GAAP.
l Profit on disposal of fixed assets Under UK GAAP profits on disposal of fixed assets are classified as non operating profits.
Under US GAAP such items would be classified as a component of operating profit.
m Disposal gain adjustment Due to differing treatment of goodwill and intangible assets under UK and US GAAP see Note 31 a and b, differences arise on the profit on sale of subsidiaries and investments.
160 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 n Restructuring Under UK GAAP, a provision for restructuring costs is required to be recognised when an entity has a present obligation as a result of a past event, it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Usually, the following plans meet the recognition criteria: Management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan of termination.
The plan identifies the number of employees to be terminated, their job classifications or functions and their locations, the expected completion date and has been communicated to employees.
The plan establishes the terms of the benefit arrangement, including the benefits that employees will receive upon termination including but not limited to cash payments, in sufficient detail to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated.
Actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.
US GAAP requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognised and measured at fair value when the liability is incurred.
Under US GAAP an entitys commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability.
The timing of recognition and related measure of one-time termination benefit arrangements provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated is dependent upon the arrangement meeting the 4 criteria mentioned above, and if the employees are required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits and, if so, whether employees will be retained to render service beyond a minimum retention period.
If employees are not required to render service until they are terminated in order to receive the termination benefits that is, if employees are entitled to receive the termination benefits regardless of when they leave or if employees will not be retained to render service beyond the minimum retention period, a liability for the termination benefits shall be recognised and measured at its fair value at the date the arrangement is communicated.
In respect to other exit costs, US GAAP requires that liabilities are simply recognised when they are incurred, which is normally when the goods or services associated with the activity are received.
Additional information regarding the restructuring costs on a UK GAAP basis is provided in Note 3 and Note 16. o Basis of consolidation Under UK GAAP, the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and those entities over which it exerts control.
Control is usually obtained via a majority share of the voting rights in that entity.
Under US GAAP a company must assess if the entities with which it has business relationships are Variable Interest Entities VIE.
VIEs are entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties.
If an entity is a VIE the reporting company is required to assess whether it is the primary beneficiary of the VIE.
Cadbury Schweppes Delaware LP is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company and is the issuer of the Quarterly Income Preferred Securities see Note 22.
The results of the entity and its financial position are consolidated for UK GAAP - purposes.
The Group has determined that the entity meets the definition of a VIE and that the Group is not the primary beneficiary of this entity.
Hence for US GAAP purposes Cadbury Schweppes Delaware LP has been deconsolidated.
The effect of these changes has been to increase the interest charge by 19 million and decrease non-equity minority interest by 19 million.
In addition an exchange gain of 17 million that was previously taken to reserves on consolidation of the US dollar denominated subsidiary is now recognised in the income statement.
The deconsolidation has given rise to an increase in short-term borrowings of 208 million and an offsetting reduction in balance sheet non-equity minority interests.
p Employee Trust Prior to 2004, under UK GAAP own shares held by the Employee Trust were accounted for as fixed asset investments.
Under US GAAP, own shares are accounted for within shareholders equity.
In 2004 the UK GAAP treatment changed see Note 1 and own shares are accounted for within shareholders equity consistent with US GAAP.
The UK GAAP accounts have been restated on a consistent basis with a consequential restatement of the reconciliation to US GAAP.
q Associates Under UK GAAP the Company records its share of operating profit in associates, before tax and interest, as a component of Total Operating Profit including associates.
Interest and tax relating to such profit is included as part of Net interest and Taxation, respectively.
Under US GAAP, equity in earnings of associates is presented in a one line item after minority interests.
Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004 Cadbury Schweppes 161 Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements continued 31 Summary of Differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles continued r Minority Interest Under UK GAAP the Company records minority interest on acquisitions at fair value.
Under US GAAP the minority interest at acquisition is recorded at historical cost.
This difference does not affect shareholders funds and net income under US GAAP.
s Cash Flows Under UK GAAP, the Group complies with FRS 1 Cash Flow Statements, the objective and principles of which are similar to those set out in SFAS 95 Statement of Cash Flows.
Under FRS 1, the Company presents its cash flows for a operating activities: b dividends from associates: c returns on investments and servicing of finance: d taxation: e capital expenditure and financial investments: f acquisitions and disposals: g dividends to ordinary shareholders: h management of liquid resources: and i financing activities.
SFAS 95 requires only three categories of cash flow activity namely a operating: b investing: and c financing.
Cash flows arising from taxation and returns on investments and servicing of finance under FRS 1 are included as operating activities under SFAS 95: dividend payments are included as a financing activity under SFAS 95 and cash flows from capital expenditure, long-term investments, acquisitions and disposals net of cash acquired or disposed are included as investing activities under SFAS 95.
In addition, under FRS 1, cash represents cash at bank and in hand less bank overdrafts.
Under US GAAP bank overdrafts are usually classified as financing activities.
Under UK GAAP, current asset investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash without curtailing or disrupting the business but that fail to meet the UK GAAP definition of cash are included within liquid resources.
Where amounts in respect of bank deposits recorded within liquid resources meet the definition of cash equivalents under US GAAP, the bank deposits are included within the US GAAP cash and cash equivalents.
A statement of cash flows presented in accordance with US GAAP using UK GAAP measurement principles is set out below: 2004 2003 2002 restated restated m m m Operating activities: Cash flow from operating activities 1,106 1,054 1,096 Interest paid 239 197 124 Interest received 28 41 50 Taxation 150 195 221 Net cash flow from operating activities 745 703 801 Investing activities: Dividends received from associates 8 9 13 Purchases of fixed assets 285 306 288 Disposals of fixed assets 26 21 37 Acquisitions and disposals 50 2,752 624 Net change in bond and other non cash investments 7 7 1 Net change in equity and non equity investments 100 11 6 Net cash used in investing activities 194 3,010 857 Financing activities: Financing 265 2,539 328 Equity dividends paid 246 234 223 Dividends paid to minority interest 19 21 25 Net cash provided by financing activities 530 2,284 80 Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 21 23 24 Effect of foreign exchange movements on cash balances 2 2 3 Cash and Cash Equivalents at beginning of year 306 327 306 Cash and Cash Equivalents at end of year 325 306 327 162 Cadbury Schweppes Report & Accounts and Form 20-F 2004
