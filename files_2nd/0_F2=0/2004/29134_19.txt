There is no corporation tax charge at 31 March 2004 or 31 March 2003 as the Company has unrelieved management expenses which are available to be carried forward.
The tax charge for 31 March 2004 and 2003 comprises overseas withholding taxes written off.
At 31 March 2004 the Company had surplus management expenses of 38 million 2003 33 million of which 7 million was of a revenue nature which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the Company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of the deductible expenses of that future period and, accordingly, it is unlikely that the Company will be able to reduce future tax liabilities through the use of existing surplus expenses.
