The Company has surplus expenses carried forward of 67m 2003 56m.
Given the Companys current investment strategy, it is unlikely to generate sufficient UK taxable profits to relieve these expenses.
As at 31 January 2004 there is an unrecognised deferred tax asset, measured at the standard rate of 30%, of 20.1m 2003 16.7m, This deferred tax asset relates to the current and prior year unutilised expenses.
It is considered uncertain that there will be a liability in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.
Therefore, the tax asset has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an investment trust and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the disposal of investments.

However, the dividend payable will be based on the number of shares in issue on the record date and will reflect any purchases and cancellation of shares by the Company settled subsequent to the year end.
Ordinary dividends paid by the Company carry a tax credit of 10%.
The credit discharges the tax liability of shareholders subject to income tax at less than the higher rate.
Shareholders liable to pay tax at the higher rate will have further tax to pay.
PEP and ISA holders may be able to reclaim all or part of this tax credit and charities are subject to transitional provisions.

The Stepped Rate Interest Loan comprises adjustable Stepped Rate Interest Loan Notes of 5,133,520 and Stepped Rate Interest Bonds of 20,534,079 issued at 97.4%.
These amounts are repayable on 2 January 2018 exclusive of any redemption expenses, together with a premium of 8,366,513.
The initial interest rate in 1987 on the Loan Notes and Bonds was 7.16% per annum.
This increased annually by 7.5% compound until January 1998 when it reached its current rate of 14.75%.
However, the combined effect of this interest charge and the accrual of the premium referred to above results in an effective interest rate of 11.28% per annum.
Interest is payable in January and July each year.
Interest on the Loan Notes is variable in accordance with the terms of the agreement with the lender, First Debenture Finance PLC FDF.
The Company has guaranteed the repayment of 34,012,852, being its proportionate share 60.10% of the required amount to enable FDF to meet all of its liabilities to repay principal and interest on its 56.6 million of 11.125% Severally Guaranteed Debenture Stock 2018.
There is a floating charge on all the Companys present and future assets to secure this obligation.
The Company has also agreed to meet its proportionate share of any expenses incurred by FDF, including any tax liability which may accrue to FDF as a result of the redemption or earlier transfer of the Stepped Rate Loan Notes and Bonds held by FDF.
The accounting treatment adopted in respect of the stepped rate interest and redemption premiums is set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies.

This loan is repayable in 2023 and carries interest at the rate of 9.25125% per annum on the principal amount payable in arrears by equal half yearly instalments in May and November in each year.
As security for this loan, the Company has granted a floating charge over all its undertakings, property and assets in favour of the lender.
This charge ranks pari passu with the floating charge noted in i above.
Following the liquidation of Kleinwort Overseas Investment Trust plc KOIT in March 1998, the Company assumed 12,000,000 of KOITs obligations to Fintrust.
Both the interest cost and repayment terms of this additional borrowing are identical to the Companys existing loan.
In order that the finance costs on this new borrowing be comparable to existing market rates at that time, the Company also received a premium payment from KOIT of 5,286,564.
This premium is being amortised over the remaining life of the loan in accordance with FRS 4, as set out in the Statement of Accounting Policies.
At 31 January 2004, the unamortised premium included within the Fixed Rate Interest Loan balance of greater than one year amounted to 4,638,156 2003 4,759,035.
The original loan from Fintrust is stated at net proceeds being the principal amount of 30,000,000 less issue costs of 141,053 plus accrued finance costs.
