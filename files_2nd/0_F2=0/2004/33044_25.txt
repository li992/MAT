17 Deferred Taxation The analysis of the deferred tax liabilities assets included in the financial statements at the end of the year is as follows: Group Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Accelerated capital allowances 54 64 3 9 Intangibles timing differences 149 111 Other timing differences 7 49 7 196 224 3 16 Gross deferred tax assets at year end are 17 million 2003: 20 million.
The Company deferred tax asset is included in debtors see Note 14.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax liabilities on property revaluations of 5 million 2003: 5 million.
The Company has unrecognised deferred tax liabilities on property revaluations of 1 million 2003: 1 million.
To the extent that dividends from overseas undertakings are expected to result in additional taxes, appropriate amounts have been provided.
No taxes have been provided for other unremitted earnings since these amounts are considered permanently reinvested by subsidiary undertakings and in the case of associated undertakings the taxes would not be material.
Distributable earnings retained by overseas subsidiary undertakings and the principal associated undertakings totalled approximately 3.9 billion at 2 January 2005.
The remittance of these amounts would incur tax at varying rates depending on available foreign tax credits.
Tax losses carried forward as at 2 January 2005 for offset against future earnings of overseas companies were approximately 136 million 2003: 119 million.
The utilisation of these losses is dependent upon the level of future earnings and other limiting factors within the countries concerned.
Tax losses totalling 33 million have expiration periods in 2005 and 2006, tax losses of 62 million expire between 2007 and 2016 and tax losses totalling 41 million have no expiry date.
Other than 12 million in 2004 2003: 4 million, deferred tax has not been recognised on these tax losses as in the opinion of the Directors it is unlikely that these losses will be recovered in the foreseeable future.
