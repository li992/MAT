Accounting policies Accounting convention and basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, adjusted for the revaluation of certain land and buildings, and comply with all applicable accounting and financial reporting standards and the Companies Act 1985.
The Group has taken advantage of transitional arrangements of Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Group financial statements The Group financial statements consist of the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and the Groups share of interests in joint ventures.
The Groups interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Goodwill Goodwill arises on the acquisition of businesses when the consideration exceeds the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising prior to 25 April 1998 has been taken directly to reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 25 April 1998 is capitalised, classified as an asset on the balance sheet and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
It is reviewed for impairment at the end of the first full financial year following the acquisition and in other periods if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Turnover With the adoption of Financial Reporting Standard 5 FRS 5 amended Reporting the Substance of Transactions: Revenue Recognition, turnover now represents external sales of goods and services during the year, net of value added tax and inclusive of the commission element associated with agency turnover.
Where promotional activity is undertaken the free sale element is excluded from turnover.
Group Sales includes the full value of agency sales when scanned through the Groups tills.
Cost of sales Cost of sales represents all costs incurred to the point of sale, including warehousing, distribution, direct marketing and store operating costs.
Fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost, or valuation, less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on a straight line basis at rates which reduce the costs of assets to their estimated residual value at the end of their economic useful lives as follows: Freehold buildings and long leasehold land and buildings Over 40 years Short leasehold interests in property unexpired lease term less than 50 years Over term of lease Plant, equipment, fixtures, fittings and vehicles Over 2 to 20 years Freehold land is not depreciated Rates of depreciation are reviewed regularly in the light of experience.
The Group reviews the carrying value of its properties regularly and in any event when changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
This includes a regular review of property for potential impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill and when deemed appropriate property values are written down.
Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill Fixed assets and goodwill are subject to review for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Any impairment is recognised in the profit and loss account in the year in which it arose.
Capitalised interest Interest incurred on borrowings to finance specific property developments is capitalised, gross of the related tax credit, until completion of the project.
Pensions The Group operates two pension schemes.
The Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme has a defined benefits section which is closed to new members and a defined contribution section.
The Kwik Save Group plc Lump Sum Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme is a defined benefits scheme which is also closed to new members.
For defined benefits, contributions to the schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the working lives of Group employees.
Variations in pension cost, which are identified as a result of actuarial valuations, are amortised over the average expected remaining working lives of employees who are scheme members.
Defined contributions are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis as they become payable.
Closed property costs Closed property costs represent amounts in respect of properties which no longer form part of the store trading portfolio.
Provisions are charged to operating profits, and recorded within provisions for liabilities and charges when properties become vacant.
The provision charged represents the best estimate of unavoidable future costs, having taken into account the time value of money.
Stock Stock is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
Cost represents invoiced cost or selling price less the relevant profit margin to reduce it to estimated cost, including an appropriate element of overheads.
Stock at warehouses is valued at weighted average cost and at stores on a first-in first-out basis.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or right to pay less tax.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Leasing commitments Rentals paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Assets used by the Group which have been funded through finance leases are capitalised and the resulting lease obligations are included in creditors net of finance charges.
Interest costs on finance leases are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Financial instruments Derivative instruments used by the Group are forward exchange contracts.
Gains or losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognised in the profit and loss account when the hedged transaction is settled.
Turnover and segmental analysis As a result of the adoption of FRS 5 amended Reporting the Substance of Transactions: Revenue Recognition, turnover has been restated in order to remove the full value of agency sales but to include the commission element earned from such sales within turnover.
The Group operates only in the business of food retailing and associated activities, with business wholly transacted in the United Kingdom.
All Group operations for the financial period are continuing.

Earnings per share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based upon the profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 55.8 million 52 weeks to 26 April 2003 profit of 39.8 million divided by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period of 491.6 million 52 weeks to 26 April 2003 485.6 million.
Underlying earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, have been calculated in order to allow shareholders to assess the underlying results of the business.
This underlying earnings per share measure is based on the same number of shares in issue as the basic calculation and the profit on ordinary activities after taxation, but excluding exceptional items and amounts to a profit of 43.1 million 52 weeks to 26 April 2003 profit of 30.8 million.
In accordance with FRS 14 Earnings per Share, diluted earnings per share have been disclosed.
The diluted earnings per share are based upon the profit on ordinary activities after taxation of 55.8 million 52 weeks to 26 April 2003 profit of 39.8 million.
The dilution effect is calculated on the full exercise of all ordinary share options granted by the Group, including performance based options where the performance condition has been met.
The calculation compares the difference between the exercise price of exercisable share options, weighted for the period over which they were outstanding, with the average daily mid-market closing price over the period.
The resulting total number of shares on which diluted earnings per share have been calculated is as follows: 2003 2004 2002 2003 Million Million Basic weighted average number of shares in issue in the period 491.6 485.6 Weighted average number of dilutive potential ordinary shares: Employee share options 8.6 4.6 Total number of shares for calculating diluted earnings per share 500.2 490.2 10.

Pensions The Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme comprises defined benefit sections for employees who were members of either the Kwik Save Retirement Benefits Scheme or the Somerfield Pension Scheme prior to September 1999 and a defined contribution section for all other members.
The Group also operates a separate closed defined benefit scheme providing lump sum retirement and death benefits for some Kwik Save employees.
The assets of the schemes are held in separate funds administered by trustees.
The Groups contributions to the defined benefit sections of the Scheme are determined taking into account the advice of the Schemes independent qualified actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The latest formal actuarial valuation of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme was carried out as at 6 April 2001.
The most significant actuarial assumptions were that future investment returns would be 6.3% pa, future salary and wage increases would be 3.4% pa, pensions subject to LPI increases in payment ie in line with RPI up to a maximum of 5% pa would increase at 2.4% pa and pensions subject to LPI increases in payment with a minimum of 3% pa would increase at 3.5% pa. As at 6 April 2001 the market value of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Schemes assets was 293 million and these assets represented 99% of the value of benefits that had accrued to members allowing for future salary increases for active members.
A formal actuarial valuation of the Kwik Save Lump Sum Scheme was carried out as at 5 April 2003.
The most significant financial assumptions were that future investment returns would be 5.6% pa and that future salary and wage increases would be 3.6% pa.
This valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 5.0 million and these represented 72% of the value of the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for future salary increases for active scheme members.
In both cases any excess or shortfall of assets over liabilities is being eliminated over the average remaining working lives of employees who are scheme members.
Any difference between the charge to the profit and loss account and the contributions paid to the pension schemes is included as an asset or liability.
As closed schemes, under the projected unit method, costs for future service benefits can be expected to increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
The total pension cost for the period was 4.1 million 2002 03 2.5 million of which 1.6 million was for the defined contribution section 2002 03 1.3 million and 2.5 million was for the defined benefit section 2002 03 1.2 million.
This reflected a regular cost of 7.2 million 2002 03 7.3 million and a credit of 3.1 million 2002 03 4.8 million in respect of the amortisation of the combined excess of assets over liabilities.
A further 0.7 million represents contributions made to personal pension arrangements and unapproved pension schemes relating to directors, past and present, and other senior employees.
The Schedule of Contributions for the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme requires company contributions of 20% of pensionable salaries for defined benefit members.
This has been in place since 21 May 2003.
It will be reviewed when the results of the 6 April 2004 valuation of the scheme are available.
Cash contributions for the period were 10.8 million 2002 03 7.9 million.
A schedule of Contributions for the Kwik Save Lump Sum Scheme was signed on 16 June 2004 requiring company contributions of 4.25% of pensionable salaries effective from 25 April 2004.
There was no cash contribution paid in the period 2002 03 nil.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
FRS 17 Retirement Benefits will not be mandatory for the Group until the year ended April 2006, however the following transitional disclosures are required.
During the year the Company acquired Aberness Limited.
Aberness Limited runs its own separate defined benefit pension scheme.
The full actuarial valuation at 30 June 2003 has been updated to 24 April 2004 by a qualified actuary in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17 and the same assumptions have been used as for the main Somerfield defined benefit scheme.
The FRS 17 disclosure as set out below relates entirely to the Somerfield defined benefit scheme as the Aberness scheme has been excluded from disclosure on the grounds of materiality as the net deficit as at 24 April 2004 was only 2.1 million.
The valuations of the Somerfield Kwik Save Pension Scheme and the Kwik Save Lump Sum Scheme were carried out as at 6 April 2001 and 5 April 2003 respectively.
An independent qualified actuary has updated these to 24 April 2004.
The major assumptions used by the actuary to value the defined benefit liabilities as at 24 April 2004 were: 24 April 2004 26 April 2003 27 April 2002 % p. a.

Acquisitions The net assets and results of the acquired business are included in the consolidated accounts from the date of acquisition.
The following table sets out the effect of the material acquisition made by the Group in the year to 24 April 2004 on the consolidated balance sheet.
Acquisition accounting has been applied.
The fair values currently established for the acquisition made in the period to 24 April 2004 are provisional due to the proximity of the acquisition to the year end.
Fair values will be reviewed based on additional information up to 30 April 2005.
The Directors do not believe that any net adjustments resulting from such a review would have a material effect on the Group.
The goodwill arising on this acquisition has been capitalised and is being amortised over 20 years.
Aberness Limited Aberness was acquired on 17 March 2004 and included in the consolidated balance sheet at 24 April 2004.
The purchase consideration was 11.8 million.
The net assets of Aberness on acquisition and the provisional fair values were as follows: Book value Fair values of acquired at date of business Revaluations acquisition m m m Goodwill 3.4 3.4 Fixed assets 3.5 0.9 4.4 Stock 3.4 3.4 Debtors 3.6 3.6 Cash 3.1 3.1 Creditors 11.2 3.2 14.4 Provisions for liabilities and charges 0.1 0.1 Net assets acquired 5.7 5.7 Consideration Cash 8.0 Loan notes issued 3.6 Cost of acquisition 0.2 Goodwill 11.8 The principal fair value adjustments made to the net book values of the assets and liabilities of Aberness were a revaluation to fixed assets of 0.9 million which was offset by a 3.4 million write off of purchased goodwill, a pension deficit recognition of 1.7 million and dilapidation provisions of 1.2 million.
For the year ended 31 March 2003, Aberness reported an audited profit after tax of 0.1 million and for the period 1 April 2003 to 14 March 2004 an unaudited post tax profit of 0.9 million based on its then accounting policies.
Post balance sheet event On the 5 May 2004, the Group announced that it would be focusing all its resources in Scotland on the expansion of the Somerfield brand.
As a consequence, the Group announced that 29 of the 51 Kwik Save stores in Scotland would be converted to the Somerfield format and the remaining 22 Kwik Save stores would close during 2004.
A depot in East Kilbride would also close.
The costs associated with the Kwik Save exit from Scotland will be reflected in the Groups 2004 05 financial statements.
