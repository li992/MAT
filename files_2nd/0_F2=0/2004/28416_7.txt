SIR DAVID CLEMENTI JONATHAN BLOOMER CHAIRMAN GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE PHILIP BROADLEY GROUP FINANCE DIRECTOR PRUDENTIAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 115 NOTES ON THE ACHIEVED PROFITS BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION 1.
BASIS OF PREPARATION OF RESULTS The achieved profits basis results include the results of the Groups long-term business operations on the achieved profits basis.
These results are combined with the statutory basis results of the Groups other operations including banking and fund management business.
The achieved profits basis results for long-term business for 2004 and 2003 have been prepared in accordance with the guidance issued by the Association of British Insurers ABI in December 2001 Supplementary Reporting for Long-Term Insurance Business the Achieved Profits Method.
The information is supplementary to the financial statements on pages 56 to 95.
METHODOLOGY The achieved profits basis results incorporate best estimate assumptions of future rates of investment return, proprietors spread in the case of Jackson National Life, policy discontinuances, mortality, expenses, expense inflation, taxation, bonus rates, surrender and paid up bases, and statutory valuation bases.
In adopting these assumptions, account has been taken of recent experience and general economic conditions, together with inherent uncertainty.
It has been assumed that the bases and rates of taxation, both direct and indirect, will not change materially in the countries in which the Group operates.
The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders from the UK with-profits business has been based on the present level of 10%.
Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets of the with-profits fund over the lifetime of the business in force.
In the UK, Department of Work and Pensions rebate business has been treated as single premium business.
ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS Under the ABI guidance, for most countries, long-term expected rates of return on investments and risk discount rates are set by reference to period end rates of return on fixed interest securities.
This active basis of assumption setting has been applied in preparing the results of all the Groups UK, US and European long-term business operations.
For the Groups Asian operations, the active basis is appropriate for business written in Japan, Korea and US dollar denominated business written in Hong Kong.
An exception to this general rule is that for countries where long-term fixed interest markets are underdeveloped, investment return assumptions and risk discount rates should be based on an assessment of longer-term economic conditions.
Except for the countries listed above, this basis is appropriate for the Groups Asian operations.
The key economic assumptions are described below: 2004 2003 UK and Europe Insurance Operations Pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return: UK equities 7.1% 7.3% Overseas equities 6.8% to 7.8% 6.6% to 7.9% Property 6.3% 6.6% Gilts 4.6% 4.8% Corporate bonds 5.5% 5.8% Assets of the Prudential Assurance Company with-profits fund applying the rates listed above to the investments held by the fund 6.5% 6.8% Expected long-term rate of inflation 2.9% 3.1% Post-tax expected long-term nominal rate of return: Pension business where no tax applies 6.5% 6.8% Life business 5.7% 5.9% Risk margin included within the risk discount rate 2.6% 2.6% i Risk discount rate 7.2% 7.4% US Operations Jackson National Life Expected long-term spread between earned rate and rate credited to policyholders for single premium deferred annuity business 1.75% 1.75% US 10 year treasury bond rate at end of year 4.3% 4.3% Risk margin included within the risk discount rate 3.1% 3.1% i Risk discount rate 7.4% 7.4% ii Asian Operations iii Weighted pre-tax expected long-term nominal rates of investment return 6.6% 7.4% Weighted expected long-term rate of inflation 3.0% 3.4% i Weighted risk discount rate 9.6% 10.4% i For all operations, a discount rate is applied to post-tax cash flows to determine post-tax results.
For most operations, these results are then grossed up for the effective rate of tax to derive the pre-tax results.
For Jackson National Life, pre-tax results are determined by applying the risk discount rate to pre-tax cash flows adjusted for the impact of capital charges.
ii The economic assumptions for the Asian Operations shown above have been determined by weighting each countrys economic assumptions by reference to the achieved profits basis operating result for new business written in the relevant year.
iii Consistent with prior periods, for the Taiwan operation, the projections include an assumption of phased progression from current rates to the long-term expected rates over a remaining period of eight years.
This takes into account the effect on bond values of rising interest rates.
INVESTMENT RETURN i Profit Before Tax With the exception of fixed income investments held by Jackson National Life, investment gains and losses during the period to the extent that changes in capital values do not directly match changes in liabilities are included in the profit for the year and shareholders funds as they arise.
In the case of Jackson National Life, it is assumed that fixed income investments will normally be held until maturity.
Therefore unrealised gains and losses on these securities are not reflected in either the achieved profits or statutory basis results and, except on realisation or impairment of investments, only income received and the amortisation of the difference between cost and maturity values are recognised to the extent attributable to shareholders.
ii Operating Profit Investment returns, including investment gains, in respect of long-term insurance business are recognised in operating results at the expected long-term rate of return.
For the purposes of calculating investment return to be recognised in operating results of UK operations, where equity holdings are a significant proportion of investment portfolios, values of assets at the beginning of the reporting period are adjusted to remove the effects of short-term market volatility.
For the purposes of determining the long-term returns, realised gains and losses arising including impairment losses on debt securities of Jackson National Life have been averaged over five years and combined with actual interest income and dividends.
For equity-related investments of Jackson National Life, a long-term rate of return of 8.0% has been assumed.
This has been applied to the monthly average carrying value of such investments after excluding the estimated effect of short-term market movements.
SUPPLEMENTAL EARNINGS INFORMATION The Groups supplemental measure of its results and reconciliation of achieved profits basis operating profit based on long-term investment returns before amortisation of goodwill to achieved profits basis profit on ordinary activities, including the related basic earnings per share amounts, are as follows: Basic Before Minority earnings ii tax Tax Post-tax interests Net per share m m m m m Pence 2004 Based on operating profit after tax and minority interests before amortisation of goodwill 1,104 315 789 2 791 37.2p Adjustment for amortisation of goodwill 97 97 97 4.6 p Adjustment from post-tax long-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns after related i minority interests 679 212 467 9 458 21.5p Effect of changes in economic assumptions 100 29 71 71 3.4 p Adjustment for post-tax profit on business disposals 48 19 29 29 1.4p Adjustment for post-tax Egg France closure cost 113 32 81 17 64 3.0 p Based on profit for the financial year after minority interests 1,521 485 1,036 10 1,046 49.1p ii 2003 Restated Based on operating profit after tax and minority interests before amortisation of goodwill 794 273 521 6 527 25.4p Adjustment for amortisation of goodwill 98 98 98 4.7 p Adjustment from post-tax long-term investment returns to post-tax actual investment returns after related i minority interests 682 212 470 4 466 22.4p Effect of changes in economic assumptions 540 130 410 410 19.7 p Based on profit for the financial year after minority interests 838 355 483 2 485 23.4p i The adjustment from post-tax long-term returns to post-tax actual investment returns includes investment returns that are attributable to external equity investors in two investment funds managed by PPM America.
These two funds are consolidated as quasi-subsidiaries but, except to the extent of Group participation in the funds, they have no net impact on pre-tax or post-tax operating profit.
Total profit, before and after tax, incorporating the adjustment from long-term to actual investment returns includes gains of 9m 4m attributable to the minority interests in these funds.
ii The average number of shares for 2004 is 2,129m.
As a result of the Rights Issue in 2004, the average number of shares for 2003 has been restated to 2,076m and earnings per share have been restated accordingly.
PRUDENTIAL PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2004 117 NOTES ON THE ACHIEVED PROFITS BASIS SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION CONTINUED 6.
COST OF CAPITAL A charge is deducted from the annual result and the balance sheet value for the cost of capital supporting solvency requirements for the Groups long-term business.
This cost is the difference between the nominal value of solvency capital and the present value, at risk discount rates, of the projected release of this capital and investment earnings on the capital.
The annual result is impacted by the movement in this cost from year to year which comprises a charge against new business profit with a partial offset for the release of capital requirements for business in force.
Where solvency capital is held within a with-profits long-term fund, the value placed on surplus assets in the fund is already discounted to reflect its release over time and no further adjustment is necessary in respect of solvency capital.
However, where business is funded directly by shareholders, principally at Jackson National Life, the solvency capital requires adjustments to reflect the cost of that capital.
In determining the cost of capital of Jackson National Life, it has been assumed that an amount equal to 200% of the risk based capital required by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners at the Company Action Level must be retained.
The impact of the related capital charge is to reduce Jackson National Lifes result by 21m 19m and its shareholders funds by 166m 164m.
PENSION COSTS The impact of pension costs on the achieved profits basis results of long-term business has been determined in the context of the methodology described in note 2.
Accordingly, for long-term business, the achieved profits basis value of new business written in the reporting period and the value of in-force business at the balance sheet date have been determined after incorporating projections of attributable pension costs into the estimates of future cash flows for the contracts concerned.
Experience variances for expenses include any difference between the actual and assumed contributions to defined benefit pension schemes.
The achieved profits basis results and shareholders funds for long-term business are, therefore, not affected by whether or not the Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits in preparing its achieved profits basis results.
On the achieved profits basis of reporting, the impact of adoption of FRS 17 for long-term business would be limited to: i balance sheet recognition of the FRS 17 basis net pensions scheme asset or liability: ii for that element of the net pensions scheme asset or liability that is attributable to the PAC with-profits fund, an adjustment of the Groups Fund for Future Appropriations by an equal but opposite amount: and iii for shareholder financed long-term business, an adjustment of the composition of achieved profits basis shareholders funds between the components of the modified statutory basis shareholders funds and additional shareholders reserves reflecting the additional shareholders interest recognised on the achieved profits basis.
As explained in note 1, the achieved profits basis results include statutory basis results for operations other than those conducting longterm business.
In preparing results for these operations the Group has continued to apply SSAP 24.
Further details are shown in note 17 on pages 81 to 83 of the Group's financial statements.
OPERATING PROFIT FROM NEW BUSINESS 2004 2003 Pre-tax Tax Post-tax Pre-tax Tax Post-tax m m m m m m i UK and Europe Insurance Operations 220 66 154 166 50 116 ii Jackson National Life 156 82 74 148 72 76 Asian Operations 312 78 234 291 80 211 Total 688 226 462 605 202 403 i The 2003 UK new business result includes 9m in respect of certain investment mandates previously reported as UK Corporate Pensions but now included as M&G institutional investment flows.
ii Jackson National Life net of tax profit: Before capital charge 95 95 Capital charge note 6 21 19 After capital charge 74 76 In determining the achieved profits basis value of new business written in the year the policies incept, premiums are included in projected cash flows on the same basis of distinguishing annual and single premium business as set out on page 73.
OPERATING PROFIT FROM BUSINESS IN FORCE Operating profit from new business is measured using the revised economic assumptions shown in note 3 and after applying any revised operating assumptions.
The profit and loss account impact for revised operating assumptions is shown below: 2004 2003 m m UK and Europe Insurance Operations i Unwind of discount 330 343 ii Cost of strengthened persistency assumption 66 50 ii Other items 34 100 230 193 Jackson National Life Unwind of discount 139 145 Return on surplus assets over target surplus 36 33 iii Averaged realised losses on bonds in excess of long-term default assumption note 10 56 66 Experience variances against current assumptions: iii iv Spread 43 17 Persistency 6 10 Expenses 4 8 Loss from strengthening of operating assumptions 3 21 Other 12 27 161 49 Asian Operations Unwind of discount 122 115 v Change in operating assumptions 56 27 Other items and experience variances 3 14 69 74 Total 460 316 i The unwind of discount for UK and Europe Insurance Operations represents the unwind of discount on the value of in-force business at the beginning of the year adjusted for the effect of current year assumption changes, the expected return on smoothed surplus assets retained within the main with-profits fund see note 13, and the expected return on shareholders assets held in other UK and Europe long-term business operations.
Surplus assets retained within the main with-profits fund are smoothed for this purpose to remove the effects of short-term investment volatility.
ii The 66m 50m cost of strengthened persistency assumption relates to the closed book of personal pension policies sold by the now discontinued direct salesforce.
The 34m charge for other items in 2004 includes 21m of costs associated with complying with new regulatory requirements and restructuring and 13m of negative experience variances.
The 100m charge for other items for 2003 includes a 35m adverse experience variance for persistency: a 29m restructuring charge: an adverse annuitant mortality assumption change of 18m: a strengthening of renewal expense assumptions of 29m: other positive assumption changes of 30m: and 19m of other negative items and experience variances.
iii The charge for average realised losses shown above is as compared to the long-term default assumption for fixed income securities, which is now presented as part of the determination of spread variance.
The charge for the default assumption is calculated using a weighted risk margin reserve RMR approach.
An RMR charge is individually assigned to asset classes based on credit ratings and, where necessary, credit analysis.
This is then weighted by reference to the carrying value of the investments.
The spread variance comprises: 2004 2003 m m Variance excluding long-term default assumption 100 54 Less: Long-term default assumption note 10 57 71 As reported above 43 17 iv The spread variance shown above has been determined after including long-term returns on equity based investments.
This treatment is consistent with the inclusion of long-term investment returns within operating profit.
Short-term fluctuations in investment returns, including those for equity based investments, are excluded from operating profit but included within the total profit or loss for the reporting period.
An analysis of the short-term fluctuations in investment returns is shown in note 10. v The 2004 56m charge for changes to operating assumptions primarily relates to Singapore, mainly for persistency, and a strengthening of renewal expense assumptions in Vietnam.
The 27m charge in 2003 for changes to operating assumptions primarily reflects expense assumption changes in Japan.

SHORT-TERM FLUCTUATIONS IN INVESTMENT RETURNS 2004 2003 m m Long-term business: i UK and Europe Insurance Operations 402 531 ii Jackson National Life 207 132 v Asian Operations 48 1 Share of investment return of funds managed by PPM America that are consolidated into Group results but attributable to external investors note 5 9 4 Other Operations 13 14 Total 679 682 i Short-term fluctuations in investment returns represent for UK and Europe Insurance Operations the difference between actual investment returns attributable to shareholders on the achieved profits basis and the expected returns as described in note 3.
The 402m of positive fluctuations in 2004 reflect the difference between the PAC with-profits fund actual investment return of 13.4% and the longterm assumed rate of 6.5%.
ii Short-term fluctuations for Jackson National Life comprise: 2004 2003 m m iii Actual investment returns on investments less long-term returns included within operating profit 183 96 Investment return related gain due primarily to changed expectation of profitability on variable annuity business arising from current year equity returns 24 36 207 132 This adjustment arises due to market returns for 2004 and 2003 being higher than the assumed long-term rate of return.
This gives rise to higher than expected year end values of variable annuity assets under management with a resulting effect on the projected value of future account values, and hence future profitability.
iii Jackson National Life Actual investment returns on investments less long-term returns comprise: 2004 2003 m m iv Actual less averaged realised gains and losses including impairments for fixed income securities 161 98 Actual less long-term return on equity-based investments 23 0 Investment depreciation on preference shares 1 2 183 96 iv Jackson National Life Actual less averaged realised gains and losses including impairments for fixed income securities m US$m equivalent Gains losses arising in years 2000 to 2004 2000 90 2001 532 2002 435 2003 65 2004 88 48 Five year total 1,034 564 Five year average included in operating result 207 113 Representing: Long-term default assumption note 9 104 57 Averaged losses in excess of the long-term default assumption note 9 103 56 207 113 Actual less averaged losses excluded from operating result but included in profit before tax 295 161 Exchange rate 1.83 Averaged realised gains differ from those reported on the statutory basis for the impact of amortisation of policy acquisition costs attributable to realised gains and losses.
These have been included in the statutory basis gains averaging calculation for the years 2000 to 2004.
On the achieved profits basis deferred acquisition costs do not feature as part of the methodology.
Accordingly the realised gains and losses included in the averaging process are exclusive of the amortisation of policy acquisition costs attributable to realised gains and losses.
v Short-term fluctuations for Asian Operations for 2004 of 48m primarily reflect bond value movements and rising equity markets.
EFFECT OF CHANGES IN ECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS The losses on changes in economic assumptions included within the profit on ordinary activities before tax arise as follows: 2004 2003 m m i UK and Europe Insurance Operations 19 122 ii Jackson National Life 53 263 iii Asian Operations 28 155 Total 100 540 i The 19m charge for 2004 for UK and Europe Insurance Operations reflects a reduction in the risk discount rate of 0.2% and a reduction in the investment return assumptions of 0.3%.
ii The 53m charge for 2004 for Jackson National Life primarily reflects reductions in the projected fund earned and crediting rates on in-force business which result in lower projected policyholder liabilities on which future spread will be earned.
iii The 28m charge for 2004 for Asian Operations reflects the net impact of revisions to the underlying long-term investment return assumptions and discount rates.
TAXATION CHARGE The profit for the year is in most cases calculated initially at the post-tax level.
The post-tax profit is then grossed up for presentation purposes at the effective rates of tax applicable to the countries and periods concerned.
In the UK this is the UK corporation tax rate of 30%.
For Asia, similar principles apply subject to the availability of taxable profits.
For Jackson National Life the profit is calculated at the pre-tax level and the effective tax rate is the rate expected to be applicable on average over the remaining lifetimes of the policies.
The tax charge comprises: 2004 2003 m m Tax on operating profit Long-term business: UK and Europe Insurance Operations 134 133 Jackson National Life 103 67 i Asian Operations 96 117 333 317 Other Operations 18 44 Total tax charge on operating profit 315 273 Tax on items not included in operating profit Tax charge on short-term fluctuations in investment returns 212 212 Tax credit on effect of changes in economic assumptions 29 130 Tax charge on profit on business disposals 19 Tax credit on Egg France closure cost 32 Total tax charge on items not included in operating profit 170 82 Tax charge on profit on ordinary activities including tax on actual investment returns 485 355 i Including tax relief on development expenses.

We, like other UK insurers, are Its about increasingly being asked to disclose our views on and response to a range of social, environmental and ethical issues.
Globalisation, for example, is a trend that no international business can afford to ignore, offering opportunities for growth and efficiency.
But the choices we make as a company affect people, including our being customers and employees around the world.
Our focus on acting responsibly and with integrity is not new.
It is a philosophy that we have striven to incorporate within the way we work throughout our history.
Responsible corporate responsible behaviour is essential in maintaining successful relationships with, among others, our customers, our people and the communities around our business.
Understanding our stakeholders needs today can also help us innovate in a way that creates both commercial and social future value.
INITIATIVES PROMOTING HEALTHY LIFESTYLES PruHealth, our private medical insurance joint venture that provides financial incentives for people to lead healthier lifestyles, was launched in 2004 in the UK.
The more effort people make to improve their general levels of fitness, control their weight, stop smoking and maintain sensible levels of alcohol intake, the lower their premiums will be.
The PruHealth model is based on similar schemes which have been established in South Africa and, more recently, in the US.
In all these markets, there have been significant changes in peoples attitude and behaviour.
For example, in Illinois, 79 per cent of policyholders took up a new fitness programme or changed their eating plan within 12 months of becoming a policyholder: this compares with a 32 per cent average among all policyholders.
IMPROVING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY Given the increasing variety and complexity of financial products, there is an urgent need to provide financial education and we play an active role around the world in addressing this issue.
Four years into our financial education programme, we are seeing significant progress.
In the UK, via partnerships with charities such as Citizens Advice, thousands of adults and children are now benefiting.
Last year, we extended our work to China.
Already, about 1,000 women in 211 State Owned Enterprises in Beijing have graduated from Prudential Corporation Asias new Invest In Your Future programme.
This draws on the skills of our female colleagues who understand the issues currently facing women in China.
The programme has proved both popular and successful and we now intend to extend the initiative to elsewhere in China and into Vietnam.
INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNITIES In 2004 we invested 4.5 million in a wide range of projects around our business, supporting, for example, educational, welfare and environmental initiatives.
This total includes the significant contribution made by many of our people around the Group through volunteering, often linked with professional skills development.
It also includes direct donations to charitable organisations of 2.7 million.
In the wake of Asias tsunami tragedy, we established the Prudential Caring Fund in late December 2004.
Prudential staff and Company matching has amassed a total of 800,000.
The funds will be channelled into four hard-hit countries where we have a presence: Indonesia, India, Malaysia and Thailand.
Prudential Corporation Asia is working with aid agencies to determine how best to allocate these funds, to ensure they have the maximum impact.
In particular, we are focusing our support on children, some of the most vulnerable victims of the tragedy.

The Mumbai operation has enabled Prudentials UK business to significantly reduce its operating costs whilst improving its customers experience, for example, through the replacement of telephone computerised interactive voice technology with an immediate connection to a well trained member of staff.
The work environment, training and technology standards are the same as those offered in the UK and, for the second year running, Prudential UK, including its Mumbai centre, was accredited as an Investor in People.
