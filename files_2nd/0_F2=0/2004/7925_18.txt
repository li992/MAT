Factors affecting the current tax charge for the year Pre-amortisation, the tax assessed for the year at 26.9% is lower than the standard higher rate of corporation tax in the UK 30.0%.
Postamortisation, the effective tax rate exceeded 30.0%.

Such tax would become payable only if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim rollover relief.
The total amount unprovided is 6m and it is not envisaged that this tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, as no dividends have been declared.
The Group currently has no plans to remit dividends which would result in a material tax effect.. 68 Notes to the Accounts 7 Dividends on ordinary shares In s million 2004 2003 2002 Interim 15.0p 2003: 12.0p: 2002: 10.0p 109 87 62 Proposed final 35.0p 2003: 30.0p: 2002: 23.0p 253 217 167 362 304 229 8 Earnings per share In pence 2004 2003 2002 Earnings per share Basic 61.4 58.1 41.0 Adjustment for amortisation and exceptional items 40.2 31.9 27.4 Adjusted 101.6 90.0 68.4 Diluted 61.2 57.9 40.8 In s million 2004 2003 2002 Earnings Basic 445 421 272 Adjustment for amortisation and exceptional items 291 231 182 Adjusted 736 652 454 Adjusted earnings per share are calculated before tax-effected exceptional items of 89m 2003: 28m: 2002: 99m notes 3, 5 and 6, taxeffected amortisation of intangibles of 6m 2003, 2002: nil, and goodwill amortisation of 196m 2003: 203m: 2002: 83m, since the Directors consider that this provides a better comparison of underlying business performance.

72 Notes to the Accounts 15 Borrowings and financial instruments The Group operates a centralised treasury function that is responsible for the management of the financial risks of the Group, together with its financing and liquidity requirements.
It does not operate as a profit centre, nor does it enter into speculative transactions, and is subject to policies and procedures approved by the Board.
On a frequent basis, the Group Treasurer discusses matters with a treasury subcommittee, consisting of senior executives, including the Finance Director and Director of Finance and Planning.
The Group Treasurer reports on a regular basis to the Board, including provision of monthly treasury summaries and an annual review of strategy.
The following table analyses the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date: In s million 2004 2003 Amounts falling due within one year Bank loans and overdrafts 97 106 Other loans 622 499 719 605 Amounts falling due after more than one year Bank loans between one and two years 110 2 Other loans between one and two years 686 635 Bank loans between two and five years 436 287 Other loans between two and five years 1,397 1,748 Other loans after five years 579 755 3,208 3,427 Total borrowings 3,927 4,032 The Group has loans amounting to 8m 2003: 8m which are secured by charges, mortgages or liens on certain fixed assets.
The loans maturing after five years are the 200m sterling bond which matures in December 2018, and the 350m sterling bond which matures in June 2012. i Interest rate risk profile of financial liabilities The Group is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates on its borrowings and surplus cash.
In order to manage interest rate risk, the Group maintains both fixed and floating rate debt and uses derivatives, including interest rate and cross-currency swaps, to vary the mix.
The following table analyses the currency and interest composition of the Groups financial liabilities at the balance sheet date.

The majority of bank borrowings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods of one month by reference to LIBOR in the case of sterling and Australian dollar borrowings and EURIBOR in the case of euro borrowings.
The capital market issuance in place at the year end bears interest post-interest and currency swaps at rates fixed in advance for six months by reference to LIBOR in the case of the US dollar bond and for three months by reference to EURIBOR in the case of the sterling and euro bonds.
The figures shown in the tables above take into account various interest rate and currency swaps.
Hence the US dollar denominated bond issued in 1999 is shown within the sterling balance, and the sterling bonds issued in 2002 and 2003 are shown in the euro balance.
The fixed rate financial liabilities do not take into account forward start swaps, which may become effective after the balance sheet date.
ii Currency risk disclosure The Group is exposed to the translation of the results of overseas subsidiaries into sterling, as well as the impact of transactions in foreign currencies.
On significant acquisitions of overseas companies, borrowings are raised in the local currency to minimise the translation risk.
For transaction risk, where necessary, forward foreign exchange deals are entered into to hedge a proportion of the forecast foreign currency cash flows.
At the year end, 33.0m notional of forward foreign exchange deals were outstanding 2003: 47.7m.
The tables below show the extent to which Group companies have monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than their local currency, at the balance sheet date: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Functional currency of Group operation Australian Sterling Euro US dollars dollars Other Total In s million 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 2004 Sterling 876 15 99 10 772 Euro 22 20 8 50 Other 3 38 52 22 65 25 838 47 91 32 757.

82 Notes to the Accounts 18 Share options continued UK Sharesave Scheme Under the terms of the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Sharesave Scheme the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to UK employees who enter into an Inland Revenue approved Save As You Earn SAYE savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered is up to 20% less than the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to the invitation.
The options may normally be exercised during the period of six months after the expiry of the SAYE contract, either three or five years after entering the Scheme.
International Sharesave Plan Under the Plan the Board may offer options to purchase ordinary shares or American Depositary Shares ADSs in the Company to non-UK employees who enter into a savings contract.
The price at which options may be offered varies depending on local laws, but for ordinary shares will not be less than 80% of the mid-market price of an Imperial Tobacco Group PLC share on the London Stock Exchange on the day prior to invitation.
In respect of ADSs the price will not be less than 80% of the closing price on the New York Stock Exchange on the same day.
Options may normally be exercised during the six months after expiry of the savings contract, three years after entering the Plan.

In respect of the November 2001 November 2004 award, based on the earnings per share to the end of the financial year, 100% of the award will vest on 26 November 2004.
Share Matching Scheme The Share Matching Scheme is designed to encourage employees to acquire and retain Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares.
There was an initiative in 2002 to mark the centenary of the founding of The Imperial Tobacco Company of Great Britain and Ireland Limited.
All employees of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries employed on 10 December 2001, the date of the centenary, were invited to purchase up to 3,000 worth of Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares and lodge them with the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided these shares are left in the Trusts, the lodged shares will be matched on a sliding scale from 20% for one years retention to a maximum of 100% if they are retained for five years.
For Executive Directors and selected management, individuals may elect to invest any proportion up to a maximum of 100% of their gross bonus in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC ordinary shares to be held by the Employee Benefit Trusts.
Provided that the shares elected for are left in the Trusts for three years, and the individual remains in employment with the Group, the participant would receive the original shares plus additional shares.
The matching ratio for bonuses is 1:1 to encourage Directors and managers to build a meaningful shareholding in the Group.
Employee Share Ownership Trusts ESOTs The Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee and Executive Benefit Trust and the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC 2001 Employee Benefit Trust have been established to acquire ordinary shares in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC, by subscription or purchase, from funds provided by the Group to satisfy rights to shares arising on the exercise of share options and on the vesting of the share matching and performance-related share awards.
At 30 September 2004, the Trusts held 4.1m 2003: 5.5m ordinary shares, with a nominal value of 407,333, all acquired in the open market at a cost of 37.2m 2003: 49.1m.
These were financed by a gift of 1.7m and an interest free loan of 35.5m.
None of the ESOT shares has been allocated to employees or Directors as at 30 September 2004.
All finance costs and administration expenses connected with the ESOTs are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
The Trusts have waived their rights to dividends and the shares held by the Trusts are excluded from the calculation of basic earnings per share.. 83 Notes to the Accounts 19 Reserves Share premium Profit and In s million account loss account As at 28 September 2002 as previously stated 964 1,129 Prior year adjustments see below 19 As at 28 September 2002 as restated 964 1,148 Profit for the year 117 Prior year adjustments see below 17 Goodwill exchange movements 83 Other net exchange movements 101 Taxation credit on borrowings hedging overseas equity investments 33 As at 30 September 2003 as restated 964 997 Profit for the year 83 Credit in respect of employee share schemes 9 Goodwill exchange movements 17 Other net exchange movements 31 As at 30 September 2004 964 919 The cumulative amount of goodwill written off against the Groups reserves, net of goodwill relating to undertakings disposed of, is 2,420m 2003: 2,437m.
Included in other net exchange movements are exchange gains of 83m 2003: losses 338m arising on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies designated as hedges of foreign net investments.
Own shares Included in the profit and loss account reserve are investments in Imperial Tobacco Group PLC own shares held by the Imperial Tobacco Group PLC Employee Benefit Trusts note 18.
The book value and market value of the shares at 30 September 2004 was 32m 2003: 36m and 49m 2003: 54m.
Prior year adjustments for UITF 17 and UITF 38 The balance sheet at 30 September 2003 has been restated following the adoption of UITF Abstract 17 Revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts as issued by the Accounting Standards Board ASB.
The Group policy for accounting and presentation of share schemes was changed during the year ended 30 September 2004 to comply with UITF Abstract 17 Revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes and UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts see accounting policies.
The impact was to reduce fixed asset investments by 36m at 30 September 2003, and increase the deficit in the profit and loss account reserve by a corresponding amount.
The consolidated cash flow statement has been restated to reflect the reallocation of the cash payments relating to the purchase of shares from Capital expenditure and financial investment to Financing.
The consolidated profit and loss accounts for the years ended 30 September 2003 and 28 September 2002 have not been restated as the effect in any one period is not material.
The impact of the change in accounting policy in the year to 30 September 2004 on Group profit after tax is not material.. 84 Notes to the Accounts 20 Acquisitions During the year the Group acquired interests in a number of small businesses, including the business and assets of CTC Tube Company of Canada, together with the purchase of minority interests in some existing subsidiary companies.
The fair and book value of the net assets acquired were 6m, giving rise to goodwill of 23m.
During 2002 the Group acquired a 90.01% interest in Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and entered into an Option Agreement enabling the acquisition of the outstanding 9.99%.
The Group also entered into a Profit Pooling Agreement whereby the holders of the outstanding 9.99% surrendered their interests in the equity and results of Reemtsma in exchange for a fixed return.
As a result the Group consolidated 100% of the results and net assets of Reemtsma and reflected a liability to the holders of the 9.99%.
During the year deferred consideration of 418m c607m was paid relating to the purchase of the remaining 9.99%.

In the opinion of the Groups lawyers, the Group has meritorious defences to these actions, all of which are being vigorously contested.
Although it is not possible to predict the outcome of the pending litigation, the Directors believe that the pending actions will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of the operations, cash flow or financial condition of the Group.. 85 Notes to the Accounts 23 Pensions The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and overseas, principally those operated by Imperial Tobacco Limited, John Player & Sons Limited, Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and Badische Tabakmanufaktur Roth-Hndle GmbH BTM.
The main schemes are of the defined benefit type and the assets are held in trustee administered funds, apart from the German schemes which are unfunded.
The principal Group scheme, covering UK employees, is the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme.
An actuarial valuation of the Scheme was made at 31 March 2001.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rate of investment return earned on the Schemes existing assets and the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
It was assumed that the future investment returns relative to market values at the valuation date would be 5% per annum and that pay and pension increases would average 4.25% and 2.5% per annum respectively.
The assets were brought into account at their market value.
At 31 March 2001, the market value of the assets of the Scheme was 2,439m.
The total assets were sufficient to cover 111% of the benefits that had accrued to members for past service, after allowing for expected future pay increases.
Group contributions to the Scheme remain suspended having regard to the surplus disclosed in this valuation.
There was no pension cost to disclose in respect of the Scheme for the year ended 30 September 2004.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants, using the projected unit method.
There were no outstanding or prepaid contributions at the balance sheet date.
Since the date of the last formal valuation of the Scheme, stock markets have fallen significantly and the market value of the assets of the Scheme has been affected by these developments.
The liabilities of the Scheme are valued using a discount rate which reflects the market levels at the date of the valuation.
Hence, the fall in the market value of the Scheme's assets does not, in itself, change the estimate of the cost of providing the pension benefits promised based on the methodology adopted for calculating the cost.
The cost will be reassessed next year following the publication of the results of the formal valuation as at 31 March 2004.
Actuarial valuations of the pension liabilities of the Reemtsma Holding GmbH & Co. KG, Reemtsma Cigarettenfabriken GmbH and BTM pension schemes were undertaken at 30 September 2003 and 30 September 2004.
These quantified unfunded past service liabilities of 337m at 30 September 2003 and 324m at 30 September 2004, which have been recognised in the accounts, together with the other German unfunded schemes.
The assumptions which had the most significant effect when valuing the Schemes liabilities were those relating to the rates of increase in pay and pensions.
These were 2.9% for the increase in pay and 1.6% for the increase in pensions.
The pension cost relating to other overseas schemes is calculated in accordance with local accounting principles.
The pension cost for foreign schemes in the year was 32m 2003: 34m.
FRS 17 disclosures for the year to 30 September 2004 The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
Full implementation of FRS 17 Retirement benefits, which was to be mandatory for the Group for the year ended September 2003, has been deferred by the Accounting Standards Board until accounting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2005.
However, the following transitional disclosures are still required.
The results of the most recent available actuarial valuations for the principal Group schemes have been updated to 30 September 2004 by Watson Wyatt LLP, actuaries and consultants.. 86 Notes to the Accounts 23 Pensions continued The main financial assumptions used in the valuation of the Schemes liabilities under FRS 17 are: At 30 At 30 At 28 September September September 2004 2003 2002 % p. a.

If the above amounts had been recognised in the financial statements, the Groups net assets and profit and loss account at 30 September 2004 would be as follows:.

91 Notes to the Accounts 29 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards Following a regulation issued by the Council of the European Union, all European companies listed in a European Securities market will be required to adopt EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs and International Accounting Standards IASs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB in the preparation of financial statements from 2005 onwards.
This means the Group will prepare its first financial statements in accordance with IFRS for the year ended 30 September 2006.
The adoption of these Standards will lead to some changes in the Groups accounting policies, results and the presentation of the financial statements.
Uncertainty still exists about the number of comparative years of financial statements the Group will be required to present to comply with US requirements.
Usually these require two years of comparative information for the profit and loss account and cash flow statement.
On 12 March 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission published proposals whereby foreign registrants adopting IFRS for the first time would only be required to provide one year of comparative information instead of two.
If the proposals are approved, the opening balance sheet for the Group will be as at 1 October 2004.
Uncertainty also exists regarding the final Standards which will be applicable on transition, particularly in respect of IAS 39 Financial Instruments : Recognition and Measurement, and IAS19 Employee benefits.
Management of transition to IFRS The Group has established a formal project team to manage the transition to IFRS reporting.
The project is monitored by a steering committee and regular updates are provided to the Board and Audit Committee.
The project consists of three phases: scoping, evaluation and implementation.
Scoping The scoping of the project was complete by March 2004 and delivered a high-level review of potential differences to existing accounting policies and disclosures, together with a view as to required system and business process changes.
Evaluation The evaluation phase was well advanced at 30 September 2004 in delivering an analysis of IFRS permitted accounting policy alternatives, specification of changes required to accounting policies, systems and business processes, as well as the development of draft financial statements.
The Group will continue to evaluate the impact of IFRSs up to actual implementation.
Implementation The implementation phase has been started.
It includes training for the Groups finance staff, formal approval of the changes to accounting policies, as well as effecting the changes to systems and business processes.
This phase is expected to be completed by June 2005.
Key differences between UK GAAP and IFRS Based on the Groups initial assessment, we believe that the major impacts on net profit and shareholders funds will be in the following areas.
The summary should not be taken as a comprehensive or complete list of the impacts that the adoption of IFRS may have on the Groups financial statements.
Other significant differences may arise as a result of the continuing detailed assessment and uncertainties relating to standards that have not yet been finalised or approved by the EU.
In addition, the IASB may issue new or revised standards, which will either be mandatory for the Groups 2006 financial statements or which the Group could adopt early.
Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments are used to manage exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks.
Under UK GAAP, these are not recognised on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments : Recognition and Measurement, all derivative financial instruments must be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, with changes in the fair value being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Hedge accounting permissibility is much more restricted under IAS 39 than at present under UK GAAP specific designation and effectiveness criteria must be satisfied.
Where hedge accounting is achieved, the profit and loss account impact of changes in fair value may be postponed and matched to the profit and loss impact of the underlying hedged exposure.
The Group has and continues to hedge underlying exposures in an efficient, commercial and structured manner.
However, the strict requirements under IAS 39 may lead to some hedge positions which are commercially effective not being effective for accounting purposes.
At this stage, the Group does not see a need to change how it currently hedges those underlying exposures and is currently reviewing the degree of hedge effectiveness for accounting purposes.. 92 Notes to the Accounts 29 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards continued Post employment benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group accounts for its pension costs under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The Group also reports the transitional disclosures required by FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in note 23.
FRS 17 and IAS 19 are similar in their rules regarding measurement and disclosure of retirement benefits, but there are significant differences in the recognition of actuarial gains and losses and the presentation of items in the financial statements.
Both standards require that defined benefit scheme assets and liabilities are valued at each balance sheet date to produce an asset or liability for recognition on the balance sheet.
All of the items recognised in the profit and loss account under FRS 17 are treated in a similar way under IAS 19.
However, actuarial gains and losses that are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses under FRS 17 are instead recognised in the profit and loss account under IAS 19, usually over a period representing the expected average remaining working lives of employees participating in the scheme.
Any deferred actuarial gains and losses are carried on the balance sheet as part of the net pension asset or liability.
The recognised asset or liability will be subject to changes in value that may be more volatile than that currently recognised under SSAP 24.
This volatility can be recognised through direct recognition in the profit and loss account or through the corridor approach described above.
The option to recognise directly in equity is currently in exposure draft form.
Intangible fixed assets - goodwill Under UK GAAP, the Group amortises goodwill on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under IFRS 3 Business Combinations, goodwill will no longer be amortised, but instead will be subject to an annual impairment test.
Goodwill deemed to be impaired will be written down to its implied value.
This will remove the amortisation charge from the profit and loss account, although if any impairment losses are indicated, they would be recorded in the profit and loss account.
Intangible fixed assets - other IAS 38 Intangible assets provides more detailed guidance on intangible assets than UK GAAP requiring the Group to recognise, capitalise and amortise other intangibles on the balance sheet providing they meet certain criteria.
Proposed dividends Under current UK GAAP, proposed dividends are accrued for as an adjusting post balance sheet event in the accounting period to which they relate.
Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date, the dividend cost will be accounted for in the period in which they are declared and approved.
Share based payments Under current UK GAAP, the Group recognises a charge in the profit and loss account for its share option schemes based on the difference between the exercise price of the award and the share price at the date of grant the intrinsic value.
Under IFRS 2 Share based payments, the Group is required to measure the cost of all options granted since November 2002 based on the fair value of the awards calculated at grant date using an option price model.
This will change the profit and loss charge to the Group, although we do not anticipate a material difference.. 93 Notes to the Accounts 30 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP The accompanying consolidated financial information has been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom UK GAAP.
Such principles differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States US GAAP.
A summary of principal differences and additional disclosures applicable to the Group is set out below.

Actual results could differ from those estimates.. 94 Notes to the Accounts 30 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued i Pensions Under UK GAAP, pension costs are accounted for under the rules set out in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
Its objectives and principles are broadly in line with those set out in the US accounting standard for pensions, Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
87, Employers Accounting for Pensions SFAS 87.
However, SSAP 24 is less prescriptive in the application of the actuarial method and assumptions to be applied in the calculation of pension costs.
Group contributions to the Imperial Tobacco Pension Fund the Scheme are suspended as a result of the surplus disclosed in note 23.
Under UK GAAP, in accordance with SSAP 24, no pension expense has been reflected in the profit and loss account and no pension asset has been recognised in the balance sheet for the UK and Irish pension schemes.
A pension liability and related pension expense is recognised for the German unfunded pension schemes.
Under US GAAP, the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with SFAS 87.
Under SFAS 87, a pension asset representing the excess of Scheme assets over benefit obligations has been recognised in the balance sheet.
ii Business combinations Both UK and US GAAP require the purchase consideration relating to a business combination to be allocated to the net assets acquired at their fair value on the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets Under UK GAAP fair values are assigned to identifiable intangible assets only if the identifiable intangibles are capable of being disposed of or settled separately, without disposing of a business of the entity.
Under US GAAP, identifiable assets are separately valued and amortised over their useful lives.
The separately identifiable intangible assets included in the US GAAP balance sheet are principally comprised of brand rights, which are being amortised over periods between 25 to 30 years.
Inventory step-up On acquisition under UK GAAP, the fair value of inventory is generally represented by the acquired companies current cost of reproducing that inventory.
Under US GAAP the fair value of inventory acquired represents the expected future selling price less any further costs to be incurred to sale, and a selling margin.
Restructuring costs On acquisition under UK GAAP, restructuring provisions may only be recognised as a fair value adjustment, if the acquired company had an irrevocable commitment to restructure which was not conditional on the completion of the purchase.
Under US GAAP, restructuring liabilities relating solely to the acquired entity may be provided in the opening balance sheet, if the following criteria as set out in EITF 95-3 are met: As of the consummation date of the acquisition, the Company begins to assess and formulate a plan to restructure the acquired company, and that plan is completed and approved within one year from the date of acquisition: and The plan specifically identifies all significant actions to be taken to complete the plan and actions required by the plan will begin as soon as possible after the plan is finalised.
Goodwill amortisation Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets acquired on acquisitions made on or after 27 September 1998 are capitalised and amortised over their useful life, not exceeding a period of 20 years.
Prior to 27 September 1998, all goodwill and separately identifiable and separable intangible assets were written off to reserves on acquisition.
The Company adopted SFAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets with effect from 1 July 2001 and accordingly goodwill arising on acquisitions after this date are not amortised.
For purchase transactions prior to 1 July 2001, goodwill was capitalised and amortised over its useful life.
From 29 September 2002, in accordance with SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortises goodwill but rather tests such assets for impairment on an annual basis or where there is an indicator of impairment.
The Company completed an annual impairment review under SFAS 142 at 30 September 2004 and no impairment of goodwill was indicated.
A reconciliation of previously reported net income under US GAAP and income per share to the amounts adjusted for the exclusion of goodwill amortisation is presented below.
Income per ordinary share adjusted for goodwill charges is calculated by adding back the goodwill charge to net income and dividing by the weighted average ordinary shares outstanding for all periods presented.. 95 Notes to the Accounts 30 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued ii Business combinations continued In s million 2004 2003 2002 Net income under US GAAP 543 496 299 Adjustment for net goodwill amortisation 27 Adjusted 543 496 326 In pence 2004 2003 2002 Basic net income per ordinary share 75.0 68.5 45.1 Adjustment for net goodwill amortisation 4.1 Adjusted 75.0 68.5 49.2 In pence Diluted net income per ordinary share 74.6 68.2 44.8 Adjustment for net goodwill amortisation 4.0 Adjusted 74.6 68.2 48.8 iii Deferred taxation Under UK GAAP, deferred taxation is provided in full on all material timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised where their recovery is considered more likely than not.
US GAAP requires deferred taxation to be provided in full, using the liability method.
In addition, US GAAP requires the recognition of the deferred tax consequences of differences between the assigned values and the tax bases of the identifiable intangible assets, with the exception of non tax-deductible goodwill, in a purchase business combination.
Consequently, the deferred tax liability attributable to identifiable intangible assets has been recognised and is being amortised over the useful economic lives of the underlying intangible assets.
iv Derivative financial instruments The Group has entered into certain swap transactions with contractual maturities exceeding those of the underlying debt being hedged, in anticipation of there being additional floating rate debt when the existing debt matures.
Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments that reduce exposures on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge accounting.
US GAAP requires the Group to record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value.
The Group has decided not to satisfy the SFAS 133 requirements to achieve hedge accounting for its derivatives, where permitted, and accordingly movements in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in the profit and loss account.
v Proposed dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends paid and proposed are shown on the face of the profit and loss account as an appropriation of the current years earnings.
Proposed dividends are provided on the basis of recommendation by the Directors and are subject to subsequent approval by shareholders.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period in which they are approved by the shareholders.
vi Employee share schemes Under UK GAAP, the cost of employee share schemes is charged to the profit and loss account using the quoted market price of shares at the date of grant less the exercise price of the share options granted.
The charge is accrued over the vesting period of the shares.
Under US GAAP, the compensation cost is recognised for the difference between the exercise price of the share options granted and the quoted market price of the shares at the date of grant or measurement date and accrued over the vesting period of the options.
For option plans which contain performance criteria, compensation cost is remeasured at each period end until all performance criteria have been met.. 96 Notes to the Accounts 30 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued vii Net income per share The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per ordinary share in accordance with SFAS 128.

There are certain differences between FRS 1 revised and SFAS 95 with regard to classification of items within the cash flow statement.
In accordance with FRS 1 revised, cash flows are prepared separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources and financing.
Under SFAS 95, cash flows are classified under operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Under FRS 1 revised, cash is defined as cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts repayable on demand.
Under SFAS 95, cash and cash equivalents are defined as cash and investments with original maturities of three months or less.
A summary of the Groups cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities classified in accordance with SFAS 95 is presented below.
For the purposes of this summary, the Group considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents.. 97 Notes to the Accounts 30 Summary of differences between UK and US generally accepted accounting principles GAAP continued ix Cash flow statements continued In s million 2004 2003 2002 Net cash provided by operating activities 793 411 511 Net cash used in investing activities 495 108 3,023 Net cash used in provided by financing activities 345 380 2,591 Net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 47 77 79 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 3 42 4 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 389 424 341 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 339 389 424 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year are: Cash at bank and in hand 262 321 312 Current asset investments 77 68 112 x Impact of new accounting standards In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities FIN 46.
In December 2003, FIN 46 was revised FIN 46R to clarify some of the provisions of FIN 46 and exempt certain entities from its requirements.
Application of FIN 46R is required in financial statements of public entities that have interests in structures that are commonly referred to as specialpurpose entities for periods ending after 15 December 2003.
Application by public entities for all other types of variable interest entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after 15 March 2004.
The adoption of FIN 46R did not result in a material impact to the Groups balance sheet or income statement.
In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB issued EITF Issue No.
03-6, Participating Securities and the TwoClass Method under FASB Statement No.
This issue addressed changes in the reporting calculation and requirements of earnings per share, providing the method to be used when a company has granted, holders of any form of security, rights to participate in the earnings of the Company along with the participation rights of common stockholders.
The Group has reviewed the contractual rights granted for stock options and concluded that EITF 03-6 does not affect the reporting and disclosure requirements.

The profit attributable to shareholders, dealt with in the accounts of the Company, is 1,095m 2003: 235m.
vi Contingent liabilities Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has guaranteed various borrowings and liabilities of certain UK and overseas subsidiary undertakings, including its Dutch and Irish subsidiaries.
At 30 September 2004, the contingent liability totalled 4,053m 2003: 4,547m.
The guarantees include the Dutch subsidiaries which, in accordance with Book 2, Article 403 of The Netherlands Civil Code, do not file separate accounts with the Chamber of Commerce.
Under the same article, Imperial Tobacco Group PLC has issued declarations to assume any and all liability for any and all debts of the Dutch subsidiaries.
The guarantees also cover the Irish subsidiaries, all of which are included in the consolidated balance sheet as at 30 September 2004.
The Irish companies, namely John Player & Sons Limited, John Player Distributors Limited and Imperial Tobacco Mullingar have therefore availed themselves of the exemption provided by section 17 of the Irish Companies Amendment Act 1986 in respect of documents required to be attached to the annual returns for such companies.. 101
