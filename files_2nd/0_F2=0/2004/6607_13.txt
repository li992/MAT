The average Group tax rate has been determined by aggregating the local standard tax rates and weighting these in proportion to accounting profits.
profits arising from manufacturing operations in Singapore, Puerto Rico and Ireland are taxed at reduced rates.
The effect of this reduction in the taxation charge increased earnings per share by 3.8p in 2004, 4.2p in 2003 and 3.7p in 2002.
106 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the financial statements 12 Taxation continued The integrated nature of the Groups worldwide operations, involving significant investment in research and strategic manufacture at a limited number of locations, with consequential cross-border supply routes into numerous end-markets, gives rise to complexity and delay in negotiations with revenue authorities as to the profits on which individual Group companies are liable to tax.
Disagreements with, and between, revenue authorities as to intra-Group transactions, in particular the price at which goods should be transferred between Group companies in different tax jurisdictions, can produce conicting claims from revenue authorities as to the profits to be taxed in individual territories.
Resolution of such issues is a continuing fact of life for GlaxoSmithKline.
The Group has open issues with the revenue authorities in the USA, UK, Japan and Canada.
By far the largest relates to Glaxo heritage products, in respect of which the US Internal Revenue Service IRS and UK Inland Revenue have made competing and contradictory claims.
GlaxoSmithKline has attempted to settle the US dispute, first through direct discussion with the IRS and subsequently through discussions between the US and UK authorities under the terms of the double tax convention between the two countries and discussions were terminated in July 2003.
On 6th January 2004, the IRS issued a Notice of deficiency for the years 1989-1996 claiming additional taxes of $2.7 billion.
On 2nd April 2004 the Group led a petition in the US Tax Court disputing the IRS claim and seeking a refund of $1 billion in taxes.
On 25th January 2005 the IRS issued a further Notice of deficiency for the years 1997-2000 claiming additional taxes of $1.9 billion.
If the IRS claims for the years 1989-2000 were upheld, the Group would additionally be liable for interest on late payment, estimated to amount to $3.0 billion net of federal tax relief at 31st December 2004, giving a total of $7.6 billion for the years 1989-2000.
The Group expects to le a petition against the tax claims for 1997-2000 in April 2005, including a further claim for refund of taxes, and will ask the Tax Court to consolidate the IRS claims for all the years 1989-2000 into a single trial.
A provisional trial date for the 1989-1996 claims has been set for October 2006.
As similar tax issues remain open for 2001 to date, GlaxoSmithKline expects to receive further substantial claims by the IRS for these years.
GlaxoSmithKline continues to believe that the profits reported by its US subsidiaries for the period 1989 to date, on which it has paid taxes in the USA, are more than sufficient to reect the activities of its US operations.
GlaxoSmithKline is in continuing discussions with the Inland Revenue in respect of UK transfer pricing disputes.
GlaxoSmithKline uses the best advice in determining its transfer pricing methodology and in seeking to manage transfer pricing issues to a satisfactory conclusion and, on the basis of external professional advice, continues to believe that it has made adequate provision for the liabilities likely to arise from open assessments.
However, there continues to be a wide difference of views between the Group, the IRS, the Inland Revenue and other relevant taxation authorities where open issues exist.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings and negotiations with the relevant tax authorities.
Except as shown in this Annual Report, no provision has been made for taxation which would arise on the distribution of profits retained by overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, on the grounds that no remittance of profit retained at 31st December 2004 is required in such a way that incremental tax will arise.
At 31st December 2004, the Group had income tax losses of approximately 385 million 2003 225 million and capital losses estimated to be in excess of 10 billion 2003 in excess of 10 billion on which the related deferred tax assets are not recognised because there is insufficient evidence that these losses will be used.

The numbers used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share are reconciled below.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated using business performance earnings.
During the years 2000 to 2003, business performance was the primary performance measure used by management and was presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and disposals of businesses, as management believed that exclusion of these items provided a better comparison of business performance for the periods presented.
For 2004, with the completion of these programmes, the Group is reporting results on a statutory basis only.
This information, which is provided in addition to the statutory results prepared under UK GAAP, is given to assist shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the underlying performance of the business and to increase comparability for the periods presented.

Brands largely comprise a portfolio of products acquired with the acquisition of Sterling Winthrop Inc. in 1994, such as Panadol, Solpadeine and Hedex, and the products acquired with the acquisition of The Block Drug Company in 2001, such as Sensodyne, Polident and Poligrip.
Each of these is considered to have an indefinite life given the strength and durability of the brand and the level of marketing support.
Accordingly, they are not amortised.
The valuation of each Sterling brand is reviewed annually using a 10 year cash ow forecast as this was the basis for the original independent assessment when they were acquired in 1994 and a post-tax discount rate of eight per cent.
The valuation of each Block Drug brand is also reviewed annually using a five year cash ow forecast and a post-tax discount rate of eight per cent.

The contribution relating to the US pension scheme is included within the amounts applied to the provision above: the contributions relating to the UK pension scheme have increased the pension prepayment amount shown under debtors in Note 21.
The Group has recognised costs in previous years in respect of plans for manufacturing the other restructuring initiated in 1998, 1999 and in 2001 following the merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham and the acquisition of Block Drug.
These plans are largely completed.
Costs recognised as a provision, principally in respect of identied severances at sites where it has been announced that manufacturing activities will cease, are expected to be incurred mainly in 2005 and 2006.
Costs of asset write-downs have been recognised as impairments of xed assets.
The Group has recognised costs in previous years in respect of plans for the integration of the Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham businesses.
Implementation of the integration following the merger is substantially complete.
Costs recognised as a provision in respect of identied severances are expected to be incurred in 2005 and in respect of the programme to encourage staff to convert Glaxo Wellcome or SmithKline Beecham share options into GlaxoSmithKline share options when employees exercise these options up to 2010.
This latter provision was discounted by 21 million in 2004 2003 28 million using risk-free rates of return.
GlaxoSmithKline is involved in a number of legal and other disputes, including notication of possible claims.
Provisions for legal and other disputes include amounts relating to US anti-trust, product liability, contract terminations, self-insurance, environmental clean-up and property rental.
The companys Directors, having taken legal advice, have established provisions after taking into account insurance and other agreements and having regard to the relevant facts and circumstances of each matter and in accordance with accounting requirements.
These provisions were discounted by 11 million in 2004 2003 25 million using risk-free rates of return.
GlaxoSmithKline has undertaken a review of its product liability claims and assessed that a number of products now have a history of claims made and settlements which makes it possible to use an IBNR incurred but not reported actuarial technique to determine a reasonable estimate of the Groups exposure for unasserted claims in relation to those products.
Apart from the IBNR provision, no provisions have been made for unasserted claims.
The ultimate liability for such matters may vary from the amounts provided and is dependent upon the outcome of litigation proceedings, investigations and possible settlement negotiations.
It is in the nature of the Groups business that a number of these matters, including those provided using the IBNR actuarial technique, may be the subject of negotiation and litigation over several years.
The largest individual amounts provided are expected to be settled within three years.

These arrangements have been developed in accordance with local practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benets can be provided by state schemes: by dened contribution schemes, whereby retirement benets are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee, or by dened benefit schemes, whereby retirement benets are based on employee pensionable remuneration and length of service.
Some dened benefit schemes now also include dened contribution sections and are described as hybrid schemes in the table.
In the majority of cases the contributions to dened benefit schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of independent, professionally qualied actuaries.
Formal, independent, actuarial valuations of the Groups main plans are undertaken regularly, normally at least every three years.
The assets of funded schemes are generally held in separately administered trusts or are insured.
Assets are invested in different classes in order to maintain a balance between risk and return.
Investments are diversied to limit the financial effect of the failure of any individual investment.
130 GlaxoSmithKline Notes to the financial statements 35 Employee costs continued Pension costs of dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, generally using the projected unit method and by spreading surpluses or deficits over the average expected remaining service lives of the respective memberships.
In certain countries pension benets are provided on an unfunded basis, some administered by trustee companies.
Where assets are not held with the specic purpose of matching the liabilities of unfunded schemes, a provision is included within provisions for pensions and other post-retirement benets.
Liabilities are generally assessed annually in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The market value of the assets of the Groups funded dened benefit pension funds at the dates of the latest actuarial valuations, some of which date back to 2001, was 5.1 billion and the actuarial value of assets was sufficient to cover approximately 97 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for future salary and pension increases.
The UK dened benefit pension schemes account for approximately 60 per cent of the Groups plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms and the US dened benefit pension schemes account for approximately 30 per cent of the Groups plans in asset valuation and projected benefit terms.
During 2004, the Group made special funding contributions to the UK and US pension schemes totalling 256 million.
The Group has agreed with the trustees of certain of the pension schemes to make additional contributions dependent on the funding status of those schemes.
In 2005, following the move to IFRS, pension costs for the Group are expected to be approximately 35 million higher than they were in 2004.
UK In the UK the dened benefit pension schemes operated for the benefit of former Glaxo Wellcome employees and former SmithKline Beecham employees remain separate.
These schemes were closed to new entrants in 2001 and subsequent UK employees are entitled to join a dened contribution scheme.
The relevant assumptions used in calculating the pension costs of all of the UK dened benefit schemes for accounting purposes are as follows: 2004 2003 % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 3.75 3.75 Discount rate 7.75 7.75 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 7.75 7.75 Expected pension increases 2.25 2.25 The regular cost for the Glaxo Wellcome pension arrangements in 2004 was 57 million, which reduced to an accounting cost of 47 million, after allowance was made for spreading the surplus disclosed as a level percentage of salary over the expected future working lifetime of the existing members some 9 years.
The most recent triennial actuarial valuations for funding purposes were carried out as at 31st December 2002.
At that date the assets of the schemes represented 92 per cent of the actuarial value of all benets accrued to members after allowing for future salary and pension increases.
The market value of the assets held by the schemes at 31st December 2002 was 2,103 million.
The regular cost for the SmithKline Beecham schemes in 2004 was 15 million, which increased to an accounting cost of 49 million after allowance was made for the spreading of the deficit over the expected future working lifetime of current employees in the scheme some 10 years.
The latest valuation was carried out at 31st December 2002 and at that date the scheme assets represented 56 per cent of the actuarial value of the accrued service liabilities based on the 2003 assumptions.
The market value of assets held by the scheme at 31st December 2002 was 856 million.
USA In the USA the former Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham dened benefit and hybrid schemes were merged during 2001.
The relevant assumptions used in calculating the pension costs for accounting purposes are as follows: 2004 2003 % pa % pa Rate of increase of future earnings 5.50 5.50 Discount rate 7.75 8.50 Expected long-term rate of return on investments 7.75 8.50 Cash balance credit conversion rate 5.25 5.75 The regular cost for the main US schemes in 2004 was 51 million, which decreased to an accounting cost of 28 million after allowance was made for the spreading of the surplus over the expected future working lifetime of current employees in the schemes.
The latest valuation was carried out at 1st January 2004 and at that date the actuarial value of scheme assets represented 110 per cent of the actuarial value of the accrued service liabilities.
The market value of assets held by the scheme at 1st January 2004 was 1,593 million.
Post-retirement healthcare The Group operates a number of post-retirement healthcare schemes, the principal one of which is in the USA.
The cost of the US scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical ination of 10 per cent reducing by one per cent per year to five per cent.
The total provision for post-retirement benets at 31st December 2004 amounted to 594 million 2003 569 million.

The dened benefit sections of the UK schemes have been closed to new members and, under the projected unit method of valuing the pension scheme liabilities, the current service cost will increase as a percentage of payroll as the members of the schemes approach retirement.
The deficits under FRS 17 reect the different basis for valuing liabilities compared with SSAP 24.
The liability under FRS 17 for the US post-retirement healthcare scheme has been assessed using the same assumptions as for the US pension scheme, together with the assumption for future medical ination of 9 per cent, reducing by one per cent per year to five per cent.
On this basis the liability for the US scheme has been assessed at 895 million 2003 908 million: 2002 766 million, which reduced to 564 million 2003 590 million: 2002 475 million after taking account of deferred tax.

Group operates share option schemes, whereby options are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at the grant price, and share award schemes, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost, subject to the achievement of performance targets.
In 2004, the Group introduced a new share award scheme, the Restricted Share Plan, whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares or ADSs in GlaxoSmithKline plc at no cost after a three year period.
The granting of restricted share awards has replaced the granting of options to certain employees as the cost of the scheme more readily equates to the potential gain to be made by the employee.
The Group operates share option schemes and savings-related share option schemes.
Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between three and ten years from the date of grant.
Grants under savings-related share option schemes are normally exercisable after three years saving.
Options under the share option schemes are normally granted at the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with UK practice, the majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are granted at a price 20 per cent below the market price ruling at the date of grant.
In accordance with the exemption granted in UITF 17 revised no charge to the profit and loss account is made in relation to these savings-related share option schemes.

The performance conditions consist of two parts, each of which applies to 50 per cent of the award.
For awards granted in 2002 and 2003, the first part of the condition compares GlaxoSmithKlines Total Shareholder Return TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the UK FTSE 100 Index over the same period.
For awards granted in 2004 the first part of the condition compares GlaxoSmithKlines TSR over the period with TSR of 13 pharmaceutical companies in the comparator group over the same period.
The second part of the performance condition compares GlaxoSmithKlines earnings per share growth to the increase in the UK Retail Prices Index over the three year performance period.
Awards granted to Directors and members of the CET from 15th December 2003 are subject to a single performance condition which compares GlaxoSmithKlines TSR over the period with the TSR of companies in the comparator group over the same period.

which are capitalised under UK GAAP but charged directly to research and development expense under US GAAP, and 37 million 2003 and 2002 nil in respect of disposals of product rights which have a higher carrying value under US GAAP than under UK GAAP.

In 2003, impairments of 658 million were recorded, of which 633 million related to Paxil which was impaired following the launch in the USA of a generic Paxil product.
Fair values are determined using a discounted cash ow model.
As discussed in Note 30 Legal proceedings, a number of distributors of generic drugs have led applications to market generic versions of a number of the Groups products prior to the expiration of the Groups patents.
If generic versions of products are launched in future periods at earlier dates than the Group currently expects, impairments of the carrying value of the products may arise.
The estimated future amortisation expense for the next five years for intangible assets subject to amortisation as of 31st December 2004 is as follows: Year m 2005 1,528 2006 1,487 2007 1,473 2008 1,472 2009 756 Total 6,716 Intangible assets which are not subject to amortisation include a pension asset of 102 million at 31st December 2004 128 million at 31st December 2003 and certain product rights.

c Theravance In May 2004, the Group formed a strategic alliance with Theravance Inc. to develop and commercialise novel medicines across a variety of important therapeutic areas.
Under the terms of the alliance, Theravance received $129 million, a significant part of which related to the Groups purchase of Theravance shares.
The Group has a call option in 2007 to further increase its ownership to over 50 per cent at a significant premium to the price paid in the 2004 transaction.
Theravances shareholders have a put option at a lower exercise price to cause GlaxoSmithKline to acquire up to half of their outstanding stock in 2007.
Given the maximum number of shares subject to the put option, the Groups obligation is capped at $525 million.
The Group has an exclusive option to license potential new medicines from all of Theravances programmes until August 2007.
Upon exercising its option over a Theravance programme, the Group will be responsible for the relevant development, manufacturing and commercialisation activities.
Depending on the success of such programmes, Theravance will receive clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments and royalties on the subsequent sales of medicines.
Based on the assessment performed, the Group is the primary beneciary of Theravance, as dened by FIN 46R, and as a result Theravance has been consolidated into the Groups US GAAP financial statements from May 2004.
The net assets acquired were measured at fair value.
The principal adjustment to the carrying value of the net assets in Theravances balance sheet prior to the acquisition was recognition of in-process research and development IPR&D at a valuation of 273 million.
The IPR&D was written-off immediately after the acquisition in accordance with US GAAP purchase accounting.
The effect of consolidating Theravance has been to decrease shareholders equity and net income by 60 million.
Additionally, the Group has accounted for the Theravance put option discussed above in accordance with SFAS 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which requires the Group to record the fair value of the put option as a liability.
The fair value of the Theravance put option at 31st December 2004 is 69 million: as at the initial consolidation of Theravance, the value of the put option was 86 million.
In accordance with SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities the call option is not recognised in the financial statements as it is not readily convertible into cash.
