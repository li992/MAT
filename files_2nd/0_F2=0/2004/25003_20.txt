The relevant prices on The London Stock Exchange on 17 November 1998 were ICAP 217p: United 638p.
To take into account the consolidation of the Companys shares on a one for ten basis i. e. one ICAP share for every ten United shares held, the first part of the calculation is to be made, as follows: 21.7 x 100 3.29% 21.7 638 Next, the figure of 3.29% should be applied to the base cost of United shares.
The resultant amount should then be multiplied by ten to reflect the consolidation of the Companys shares.
Therefore, the base cost for one Company share received on Demerger following consolidation will be equivalent to 32.9% of the original base cost of one United share.
Following the share split effective 9 February 2004, 32.9% will be equivalent to 6.58%.
The new base cost for United shares held will be 96.71% of their original base cost.
Capital gains tax base cost of ICAP shares received by Intercapital shareholders at the time of the Merger For the purposes of UK capital gains tax, former Intercapital shareholders who acquired shares in the Company by means of the Merger, 9 September 1999, will be treated as having acquired those shares for the same consideration and at the same time as their Intercapital shares.
When an original Intercapital shareholder has to account for UK capital gains tax upon a subsequent disposal of the Companys shares acquired by means of the Merger, then the base cost of each ICAP share will be 8.12 times the consideration attributable to one original Intercapital share.
Following the share split effective 9 February 2004, 8.12 times will be equivalent to 1.62 times the consideration attributable to one original Intercapital share.
