Notes to the Accounts 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of investment properties and in accordance with all applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
The financial statements are in compliance with the Companies Act 1985 except that, as explained below, investment properties are not depreciated.
In addition, the groups treatment of negative goodwill represents a departure from Financial Reporting Standard 10, Goodwill and intangible assets as described in note 20.
Basis of Consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and all its subsidiaries, together with the groups share of results, assets, liabilities and cash flows arising from investments and developments which are under the joint control of the group and its partners.
Foreign Currencies All assets, liabilities and results denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year end.
The principal foreign currency used is the euro and the exchange rate ruling at 31 December 2004 was 1 1.41 31 December 2003: 1 1.42.
Differences arising from the translation of the net equity investment in overseas subsidiaries and currency loans for such investments are dealt with through reserves.
Differences arising on the revaluation surplus are accounted for in the revaluation reserve.
Other differences resulting from the conversion of one currency into another are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Net Rental Income Rent increases arising from rent reviews are taken into account when such reviews have been agreed with tenants.
Where a lease incentive does not enhance the property, it is amortised over the period to the earlier of the first rent review, the first break option, or the end of the lease term.
On new leases with rent free periods, rental income is allocated evenly over the period from the date of lease commencement to the date of the first rent review.
Differences between property operating expenditure incurred and that recovered from tenants through service charges are included in net rental income.
Profits on Sale of Properties Profits on sale of properties are taken into account on the completion of contract.
Profits arising from the sale of trading properties acquired with a view to resale are included in the profit and loss account as part of the operating profit of the group.
Profits or losses arising from the sale of investment properties are calculated by reference to book value at the end of the previous year, adjusted for subsequent capital expenditure, and treated as exceptional items.
Cost of Properties The net development outgoings, including interest, attributable to properties held for development or resale are added to the cost of such properties.
Lease incentives which enhance the property are added to the cost of properties.
A property is regarded as being in the course of development until ready for its intended use.
For buildings that are let this will be when construction and fitting out are complete, whilst for unlet buildings this will be at the end of the construction period.
Valuation of Properties Properties held for the long term are valued at the balance sheet date at market value.
Surpluses and deficits arising from revaluation are taken to the revaluation reserve.
Properties held for resale are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where properties held for resale are transferred to or from the investment portfolio, they are transferred at market value.
24 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued Depreciation In accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
19 Accounting for investment properties, no depreciation is provided in respect of freehold properties or leasehold properties with over 20 years to expiry.
This is a departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 which requires all properties to be depreciated.
Such properties are not held for consumption but for investment and the directors consider that to depreciate them would not give a true and fair view.
Depreciation is only one of many factors reflected in the annual valuation of properties and accordingly the amount of depreciation which might otherwise have been charged cannot be separately identified or quantified.
The directors consider that this policy results in the accounts giving a true and fair view.
Depreciation is provided on fixtures, fittings and equipment on a straight line basis having regard to their estimated useful lives of between three and five years.
Borrowing Expenses All costs incurred directly in connection with the issue of debt are deducted from the proceeds and the net amount included in liabilities.
The costs, together with any discount on issue, are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant return on the carrying amount of the liability.
Financial Derivatives The group currently uses forward rate agreements and interest rate and currency swaps to help manage its exposures to movements in interest and exchange rates.
Differences between interest payable and receivable on interest rate swaps are dealt with, on an accruals basis, within the groups cost of finance.
In the case of currency swaps, which are used to hedge foreign currency assets, any differences arising on translation at the balance sheet date are taken to reserves.
Tax The tax charge on disposals is allocated between the current element, which is included in the profit and loss account and the element relating to prior years revaluation gains, which is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Deferred Tax Deferred tax is provided on all timing differences and is reduced by available tax losses.
Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
No provision is made for tax that may arise on the future disposal of the groups properties.
Pensions The costs of the groups defined benefit pension schemes are spread over the remaining service lives of participants of the schemes.
Profit before tax has not been analysed by sector or geographical segment as administration expenses and net cost of finance cannot be allocated to these segments.

The Scheme was closed to new entrants with effect from 1 January 2003 and a Group Personal Pension Plan has been established for new employees.
The pension cost has been assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the Attained Age method.
The most recent actuarial investigation was carried out at 31 December 2003.
Principal actuarial assumptions 31 December 2003 Rate of investment return 7.0% Increase in pensionable salaries 3.0% Increase in retail price index 3.0% Increase in pensions in payment 3.0% Valuation of investments Market values At the date of this actuarial investigation, the market value of the assets was 21.5 million, and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover 81% of the benefits that had accrued to members after fully allowing for future salary increases.
In calculating the net pension expense the deficit is amortised over the remaining expected service lives of the employees on a percentage of salary basis.
As far as cash payments are concerned, the deficit is being recovered over a ten year period to January 2015 by fixed monetary amounts.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits FRS 17 The full requirements of FRS 17 must be adopted for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The following information is disclosed for the Scheme in line with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17: Principal actuarial assumptions for FRS 17 2004 2003 2002 Discount rate for scheme liabilities 5.8% 6.0% 5.5% Increase in pensionable salaries 3.0% 3.0% 4.0% Increase in retail price index 2.5% 2.5% 2.0% Increase in pensions in payment 2.5% 2.5% 2.0% For the purposes of FRS 17 the actuary has derived the present value of liabilities at 31 December 2004 by updating the results of a full actuarial valuation carried out at 31 December 2003.

The value of the unfunded commitment at 31 December 2004 amounted to 1.5 million 2003: 1.0 million.
This liability has been included in creditors on the groups balance sheet.
The assumptions used for the purposes of the FRS 17 valuation of the scheme are the same as those used for the Hammerson Group Management Pension & Life Assurance Scheme.
The liability under the scheme was 1.5 million at 31 December 2004 2003: 1.0 million.
US unfunded unapproved scheme The US unfunded pension commitment relates to obligations to five former employees or their spouses.
The value of the liability has been calculated by a qualified actuary using the Attained Age method.
An actuarial investigation was carried out at 31 December 2003 with the principal actuarial assumptions being a rate of investment return of 6.5% and an increase in pensions in payment of 5.0%.
At the date of this actuarial investigation the present value of the pension commitment was 4.4 million.
A liability of 3.3 million is included in creditors on the groups balance sheet.
For the purpose of FRS 17 for both 2003 and 2004, the discount rate for scheme liabilities was 6.5% and the increase in pensions in payment was assumed to be 5.0%.
The present value of the liabilities at 31 December 2004 amounted to 4.4 million 2003: 4.1 million.

32 7 TAX continued f Effects of French SIIC elections In April 2004 the group elected for all its French business, with the exception of 9 place Vendme, to enter the French SIIC tax-exempt regime with effect from 1 January 2004.
Exit taxes totalling 70.8 million, equivalent to 25p per share on an adjusted net asset value basis, arose on the conversion and will be payable in four equal annual instalments with 17.7 million being paid in December 2004.
The part of the exit taxes relating to prior year revaluations, 27.2 million, is included in the statement of total recognised gains and losses with the balance of 43.6 million dealt with in the profit and loss account.
Deferred tax of 45.0 million has been written back and 121.0 million of contingent tax released.
The SIIC rules require Hammersons French subsidiaries to distribute a proportion of their profits to Hammerson plc and allowance is made within deferred tax and contingent tax for the UK tax that may arise when dividends are received.

The discount on West Quay Shopping Centre Limited relates principally to contingent tax.
This accounting treatment does not comply with Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets, which requires that negative goodwill be recognised in the balance sheet as a fixed asset.
However, in accordance with a ruling made in February 2002 by the Financial Reporting Review Panel over a similar issue, the directors consider that the accounting treatment adopted is necessary in order for the financial statements to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the group.
