60 Alliance UniChem Plc Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2004 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles and applicable accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies adopted within that convention are set out below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
An unaudited memorandum disclosure has been made on the face of the primary financial statements to show the Euro equivalents, using the average exchange rate for the Group profit and loss account and Group cash flow statement, and the closing exchange rate for the Group balance sheet as disclosed in note 2.
In addition, profit on ordinary activities before taxation, amortisation of intangible assets and exceptional items has been disclosed on the face of the Group profit and loss account to assist understanding.
Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings and the Groups shares of the results and net assets of associated undertakings and joint ventures.
The results of undertakings acquired or disposed of during the year are consolidated in the Group financial statements for the period that the Group has control.
All material undertakings within the Group make up their accounts to 31 December.
Acquisitions Businesses acquired are accounted for using the acquisition method.
On the acquisition of a business, or an interest in an associate, fair values reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition are attributed to the net assets including retail pharmacy licences acquired.
Adjustments are also made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the Group.
Where statutory merger relief is applicable, the difference between the fair value of the business acquired and the nominal value of shares issued as purchase consideration is treated as a merger reserve.
Goodwill The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets including retail pharmacy licences of businesses acquired in the year is capitalised and amortised over its useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
Goodwill acquired prior to 1998 was written off against reserves, and will be charged through the profit and loss account in the event of subsequent disposal.
Retail pharmacy licences Retail pharmacy licences, being the exclusive right to be reimbursed for the dispensing of prescription medicines from a specified location, are capitalised where there is an asset that can be separated from the other identifiable assets that together form a retail pharmacy business.
Where they have a finite economic life they are amortised over that economic life.
Where they do not have a finite economic life they are not amortised and are subjected to an annual impairment test.
The cost of retail pharmacy licences less any impairment in value and any amortisation are included in intangible fixed assets.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost of these assets to their estimated residual values on a straight-line basis over the period of their estimated useful economic lives: Freehold buildings 50 years Long and short leasehold properties the shorter of the period of the lease and 50 years Furniture, fixtures and equipment between three and ten years Motor vehicles between three and ten years Freehold land is not depreciated.
Investments Investments are stated at cost less provisions for impairment.
Stocks Stocks consist of goods held for resale and are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Securitised receivables Where the Group has sold trade receivables and received an initial cash payment on a non-recourse basis in return, the gross amount of the trade receivables sold is disclosed on the face of the balance sheet as securitised receivables and the amounts received as non-recourse receipts.
The Group retains an interest in the receivables represented by the net of these two amounts.
Charges payable in respect of receivables so securitised that are fixed are included within administration expenses.
Costs that vary according to a principal amount, an interest rate and a time period are treated as net interest payable and similar charges.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law, at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from either the revaluation of fixed assets or rolled over gains where there is no commitment to sell the asset.
Deferred tax is only provided on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is a commitment to remit the earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as more likely than not to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
61 Alliance UniChem Plc 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs Assets and liabilities held by ESOPs are included in the balance sheet where the Group has fide facto control of the shares held by the ESOP Trust.
The shares of the Company held by the ESOP Trust are deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
Turnover Turnover is the amount derived from the sale of goods and services in the normal course of business outside the Group, net of trade discounts, value added tax and other sales-related taxes.
Turnover is recognised at the point at which title passes.
Pensions The Group accounts for pension schemes in accordance with FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
For defined contribution schemes, contributions are charged to operating profit as payable in respect of the accounting period.
For defined benefit schemes the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
They are included as part of staff costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period the vesting occurs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or credits adjacent to interest.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Where defined benefit schemes are funded, the assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group, in separate trustee administered funds.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated on the balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of the related deferred taxation, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange The profit and loss accounts and cash flows of undertakings with a reporting currency other than Sterling are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange, other than substantial exceptional items that are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
The adjustment to closing rates is taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Balance sheets are translated at closing rates.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation at closing rates of the opening balance sheets of undertakings with a reporting currency other than Sterling are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses, less exchange differences arising on related currency borrowings and financial instruments.
Tax charges and credits arising on such items are also taken to reserves.
Other currency translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The results, assets and liabilities of undertakings in hyper-inflationary economies are adjusted to reflect current price levels before translation, taking any gain or loss on the net monetary position through the profit and loss account.
Transactions in currencies other than the reporting currency of the undertaking are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related foreign currency contract.
Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element of the lease outstanding.
Costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
Derivatives and other financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are structured so as to reduce the market risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
If the underlying transaction to a hedge ceases to exist, the hedge is typically cancelled and the profit or loss recognised immediately.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
Foreign exchange contracts hedging balance sheet assets and liabilities are revalued at closing rates and exchange differences arising are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Gains and losses on contracts hedging forecast transactional cash flows, and on option instruments hedging the Sterling value of foreign currency denominated income, are recognised in the hedged periods.
Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are classified in the cash flow statement in a manner consistent with those of the transactions being hedged.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the issue.

Loan notes totalling 2.9 million falling due within one year can be redeemed by the holders giving one months notice before an interest payment date.
However, if no notice is given, these notes will fall due at their maturity dates, which are between 2006 and 2014.
At the year end these loan notes bore interest at floating rates of between 3.60% and 3.99% per annum.
The proceeds from the issue of Senior notes have been converted through cross-currency swaps into Euros, Swiss Francs, Sterling and Norwegian Kroner.
At the same time, the underlying fixed interest rates have been swapped into floating rates of the relevant currency for the duration of the Senior notes.
At year end, the Senior notes effectively bore interest at floating rates of between 2.11% and 6.42% per annum dependent upon currency.
The amount reported against each Senior note represents the translation of the swapped currencies at year end exchange rates.
Within cash at bank and in hand, cheques collected in relation to the UK securitised receivables programme totalling 32.5 million 2003 61.3 million were awaiting clearing before being transferred to Alliance No.

Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from this note other than the currency profile of monetary assets and liabilities.
a Book and fair value of financial instruments A comparison of book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is set out below: 2004 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value million million million million Primary financial instruments held to finance the Groups operations Cash at bank and in hand 100.9 100.9 117.2 117.2 Loans to associated undertakings 42.5 42.5 46.7 46.7 Other listed investments 40.8 44.7 55.8 57.6 Other unlisted investments 1.8 1.8 4.5 4.5 Debtors due after one year 40.2 40.2 41.0 41.0 Financial assets 226.2 230.1 265.2 267.0 Bank overdrafts 82.1 82.1 156.8 156.8 Bank loans 249.0 249.0 196.9 196.9 Loan notes 409.8 444.3 460.4 483.1 Obligations under finance leases 20.4 20.4 8.5 8.5 Total debt 761.3 795.8 822.6 845.3 Derivative financial instruments held to manage the interest rate and currency profile Interest rate derivatives 7.1 11.9 Cross currency derivatives 150.6 136.9 121.8 99.2 Financial liabilities 911.9 939.8 944.4 956.4 The fair values of fixed asset investments and interest rate and currency derivatives are based on market value.
The fair values of the Senior notes are calculated using discounted cash flow methodology, based on third party estimates of the Groups credit spread above the benchmark swap curve.
The fair value of all other financial instruments is approximately equal to book value due to either their short-term nature or their being at variable interest rates.
b Interest rate profile The interest rate profile of financial assets and liabilities, after taking into account interest rate and currency derivative contracts, was as follows: At fixed At floating Non-interest interest rates interest rates bearing Total million million million million 2004 financial assets Sterling 48.8 0.2 49.0 Euro 73.4 47.5 120.9 Other 2.3 52.5 1.5 56.3 2.3 174.7 49.2 226.2 2003 financial assets Sterling 59.1 0.7 59.8 Euro 79.2 59.0 138.2 Other 64.5 2.7 67.2 202.8 62.4 265.2 Floating rate financial assets mainly comprise bank deposits and loans to associated undertakings which bear interest based on London interbank reference rates.

In addition to the amounts detailed in the above table, the Group has Sterling denominated floating financial liabilities of 100.0 million 2003 100.0 million and Euro denominated floating financial liabilities of 300.8 million 2003 299.5 million relating to non-recourse receipts.
At the outset of the UK securitisation programme, the Group swapped the Sterling non-recourse receipts to repay Euro denominated debt.
These swaps and other short-term swaps used to convert Sterling cash to Euros to repay Euro denominated debt are shown in the table above.
They are all on a floating rate basis.
The Group has further Euro denominated derivative financial instruments to hedge securitisation costs that vary according to interest rates, totalling 98.8 million 2003 112.5 million.
These instruments have a weighted average interest rate of 3.9% which is fixed for a weighted average period of 1.8 years 2003 4.3% and 1.5 years.
Floating rate financial liabilities mainly comprise bank overdrafts, loans and loan notes predominantly bearing interest at margins over London interbank reference rates.
c Currency profile There are no significant unmatched currency exposures on monetary assets and liabilities after taking into account the effects of currency swaps and forward exchange contracts.
d Maturity profile of financial liabilities An analysis of financial liabilities, by due date of repayment, is as follows: Obligations Bank under finance overdrafts Bank loans Loan notes leases Total million million million million million 2004 Within one year 82.1 85.1 3.1 5.5 175.8 Between one and two years 63.3 1.3 64.6 Between two and five years 112.7 106.0 3.4 222.1 Over five years 2.4 436.8 10.2 449.4 82.1 263.5 545.9 20.4 911.9 2003 Within one year 156.8 70.7 28.8 1.2 257.5 Between one and two years 12.4 1.4 13.8 Between two and five years 123.4 35.4 4.0 162.8 Over five years 4.4 504.0 1.9 510.3 156.8 210.9 568.2 8.5 944.4 73 Alliance UniChem Plc 19 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS CONTINUED e Undrawn committed borrowing facilities The maturity profile of the Groups undrawn committed facilities, where all conditions precedent had been met, at 31 December was: 2004 2003 million million Within one year 0.8 Between two and five years 126.6 172.9 Total 126.6 173.7 f Hedging Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

22 PENSIONS The Group operates several pension arrangements: the Groups total pension cost included within operating profit was 12.6 million 2003 13.0 million, being 5.7 million 2003 7.2 million in respect of its defined benefit pension arrangements and 6.9 million 2003 5.8 million in respect of its defined contribution arrangements.
UK scheme The Group operates a principal UK pension scheme which has two plans: the UK Benefit Plan which is a funded defined benefit arrangement, and the UK Contribution Plan, which is a funded defined contribution arrangement.
Both plans are administered by an independent company and their assets are held under trust separately from those of the Group.
The pension costs in respect of the UK benefit plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow, an independent firm of actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation used for this purpose was carried out as at 1 January 2003.
This has been updated by Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow to take account of the requirements of FRS 17, in order to assess the liabilities at 31 December 2004.
Following the valuation, it was agreed to adopt an employer contribution rate of 10.9% of pensionable pay, effective from 1 January 2004.
In addition annual payments of 5.5 million were agreed for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and further annual payments of 4.3 million for the subsequent 11 years.
Previously, the rate payable had been 13.3% of pensionable pay since 1 January 2001.
Other schemes The Group also sponsors a number of defined benefit plans outside of the UK, some of which are material.
In The Netherlands there is a defined benefit pension plan, which is administered by a separate pension fund.
In France there are insured arrangements providing retirement and termination benefits.
In Norway many employees participate in an industry-wide multi-employer scheme operated by a government agency.
During 2004, for the first time the agency provided an allocation of the assets and liabilities of the scheme to the participating members.
The allocation was based on the proportion of total member contributions to the scheme.
The Groups notional share of the surplus at 31 December 2004 calculated using this method was 2.1 million.
Over the next few years, the agency intends to identify the assets and liabilities of the scheme by individual participant based on their specific service, and allocate these to current members.
The results of this work may give a different allocation of the assets and liabilities from the notional allocation.
Until this work is completed the scheme will continue to be accounted for as a defined contribution plan in accordance with FRS 17.
In addition, in Norway there are two insured defined benefit schemes in place, which are accounted for as defined benefit schemes.
The costs of material defined benefit plans have been recognised in the Group financial statements in accordance with the requirements of FRS 17.
The financial assumptions for the non-UK plans are weighted averages of the assumptions used for the overseas plans included.
