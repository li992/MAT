SVG Capital plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 43 Notes to the accounts 1 Accounting policies A summary of the more important accounting policies is set out below: a These accounts have been prepared under the historical cost convention modified to include certain investments at valuation, and in accordance with accounting standards applicable in the United Kingdom and the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies.
The accounting policies used to prepare the accounts have no material variations from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and those required by SEC Regulation S-X.
b Tangible fixed assets The Groups tangible fixed assets, which include telecommunications, leasehold improvements, office equipment and computers, are included at cost and are depreciated over their useful lives on a straight line basis at rates varying between 20% and 33% per annum.
c Fixed asset investments Equity share investments, fixed income and loan investments, interests in partnerships and unit trusts, together with interests in any associated undertakings and the investments in the various Schroder Ventures and Permira funds, will be regarded as financial fixed assets as they are held for long term investment purposes.
The treatment of associated undertakings in the same way as other fixed asset investments is in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 9. d Valuation of investments The Companys investments in the various Schroder Ventures and Permira funds are valued by the Directors at the balance sheet date by valuing the underlying investments comprising the portfolios of the Schroder Ventures and Permira funds in accordance with the valuation policies, as adjusted, where appropriate, for other assets and liabilities of the Schroder Ventures and Permira funds.
The valuation policies of the Company are consistent with the current guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association BVCA, which came into effect on 1 August 2003.
In accordance with these guidelines where, in an exceptional case, the strict application of the valuation policies would not, in the opinion of the Directors, result in a fair value being ascribed to an investment, the Directors may adopt an alternative valuation in accordance with the overriding BVCA principle that the value should be a fair one.
Carried interest and management fees For the purpose of valuing the Companys holdings in the various Schroder Ventures and Permira funds, management fees due to Schroder Ventures or Permira will be accounted for on the accruals basis.
An estimate of Carried Interest, the allocation to Schroder Ventures or Permira of 20% of the profits arising in each Fund calculated by reference to the valuations of the underlying investments, will be deducted from the values of the Companys holdings.
Disclosed valuations of individual investee companies will, by necessity, be shown before deduction of Carried Interest.
e Income and capital gains recognition The Companys income and capital gains are expected to be derived primarily from future distributions in respect of its holdings in Schroder Ventures or Permira funds.
The Company will account for such distributions by reference to the underlying source of the distribution.
Revenue distributions receivable by the Company which arise from dividends, interest and other revenue items through the Schroder Ventures and Permira funds will be credited to the Companys revenue account when such income distributions are declared.
Investment income arising from directly held investments of the Company will, in the case of dividends, be included as revenue in the period in which they go exdividend, and, in the case of interest income which, together with interest payable and all other revenue expenses, will be treated on an accruals basis.
Realised profits on capital distributions receivable by the Company which arise from the realisation of investments within the Schroder Ventures and Permira funds will be credited to the Companys capital reserve when they are declared.
f Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies will be translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies will be translated into sterling at exchange rates at the date of the accounts.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investments will be taken to reserves and reported in the Consolidated and the Companys Statement of Total Return.
Foreign subsidiary financial statements are translated into sterling using the closing rate method with all exchange differences taken to reserves and reported in the Consolidated Statement of Total Return.
All other foreign exchange differences will be included as an exchange gain or loss in capital reserve or in the revenue account depending on whether the gain or loss is of a capital or revenue nature respectively.
g Finance costs All finance costs are charged directly to revenue.
h Taxation Deferred tax is provided in accordance with FRS19 on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that they are recoverable.
i Basis of consolidation The Consolidated Statement of Total Return and Balance Sheet include the financial statements of the company and its subsidiary undertakings made up to the balance sheet date using the purchase method.
Goodwill arising on consolidation is written off against reserves on acquisition.
In the Companys accounts, investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated in accordance with the policies outlined under c above.

Further details of the Scheme can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts of Schroders plc.
In particular, the Scheme had 612 active members in the defined benefit section at 31 December 2003 and the accounts of Schroders plc disclosed a net pension deficit in respect of the Scheme of 20.1 million, calculated under FRS 17 based on interim valuations prepared by independent qualified actuaries.

The capital return per ordinary share is based on the net return for the year of 115,411,000 year ended 31 December 2003: return of 22,954,000 and on 113,329,674 ordinary shares year ended 31 December 2003: 104,018,459, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The diluted revenue returns per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2004 have been calculated in accordance with FRS 14 under which the convertible bonds note 16 are regarded as dilutive if, on conversion, the increased returns attributable to equity shareholders arising from the interest saved less taxation, divided by the increased weighted average number of shares, are less than the basic returns per ordinary share.
These calculations assume that conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares takes place on 1 January 2003, at an exercise price of 480p for the 2013 Bonds.
As there are revenue losses, the convertible bonds do not have a dilutive effect on revenue returns in either year.
The diluted revenue returns per ordinary share have also been calculated assuming the exercise of all potential dilutive ordinary shares arising from the share options in issue see note 19.
As there are revenue losses, the options do not have a dilutive effect on revenue returns in either year.
The diluted capital returns are based on 116,370,467 2003: 105,858,888 ordinary shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year assuming conversion of the bonds and exercise of the options.

30 Risk The following disclosures relating to the risks faced by the Company are provided in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and other financial instruments disclosures.
Financial instruments and risk profile The Companys principal investment objective is to achieve capital appreciation by investing primarily in an international portfolio of buy-out and development capital funds, which are managed or advised by Schroder Ventures or Permira.
These investments are typically illiquid.
In addition, the Company holds money market instruments, cash and short-term deposits and various items such as debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations.
These financial instruments held by the Company are generally liquid.
The holding of securities, investing activities and associated financing undertaken pursuant to this objective involves certain inherent risks.
Events may occur that would result in either a reduction in the Companys net assets or a reduction of revenue profits available for dividend.
As an investment trust, the Company invests in securities for the long term.
The Company has not taken out any derivatives contracts to date.
Currency risk The Company is exposed to currency risk directly since the majority of its assets and liabilities are denominated in foreign currency and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Company does not normally hedge against foreign currency movements affecting the value of its investments, but takes account of this risk when making investment decisions.
The Company does have a 285m loan facility which, if drawn, would act as a hedge against the currency risk on the value of its euro-denominated assets.

The Company did not hold any fixed rate financial assets.
Financial liabilities of the Group The Company issued 49.0 million nominal of 10 year 4.5% Subordinated Convertible Bonds in the year ended 31 December 2003.
The Company does not have any other borrowings at the balance sheet date, although it does have in place a loan facility of 285 million with The Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The main risk arising from the Companys financial instruments is valuation risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policy for managing this risk as summarised below.
This policy has remained substantially unchanged since the launch of the Company.
Interest rate risk The Companys revenue will be affected by changes in prevailing interest rates since the majority of its income derives from money market instruments and bank deposit interest.
It also pays interest on short-term loans that may be taken out from time to time.
The effect of interest rate changes on the valuation of investments and debt forms part of valuation risk, which is considered separately below.
Valuation risk The Companys exposure to valuation risk comprises mainly movements in the value of its underlying investments.
A breakdown of the Fund portfolio is given on pages 20 to 23 and a detailed analysis of the 20 largest underlying companies is given on pages 12 to 17.
In accordance with the Companys accounting policies, set out on pages 43 to 44, all underlying investments are valued by the Directors in accordance with the current guidelines issued by the British Venture Capital Association BVCA, adopting the overriding BVCA principle that the value should be a fair one.
The Company does not hedge against movements in the value of these investments.
Uncertainty arises as a result of future changes in the valuation of the Companys underlying investments, the majority of which are unquoted, and the effect changes in exchange rates may have in the sterling value of these investments.
Development Stage Equity Investments and Early Stage Equity Investments, by their nature, involve uncertainty as to the ultimate value likely to be realised on the disposal of those investments, particularly as their unquoted nature means that a ready market may not exist for them.
The Companys sensitivity to valuation risk will be affected by changes in levels of borrowing and liquidity, as approved by the Board.
At 31 December 2004, a 10% movement in the valuation of the Groups Fund portfolio, including UK listed equity funds and co-investments, would result in a 10.4% change in net asset value per share.
The Directors believe that the diversified nature of the Companys portfolio and the number of underlying investments in the Funds significantly reduces the risks normally associated with making investments in the buy-out and development capital markets.
Holdings risk In certain circumstances, the Company may wish to transfer its holdings in particular Funds.
In a majority of the Funds in which the Company will invest, the general partner, trustee or manager has the ultimate right, similar to that exercisable by a board of a private company, to refuse to register the transfer of an interest.
While the Company has no reason to believe that any request for the transfer of an interest would be refused, it is of course conceivable that the general partners, trustees or managers overriding fiduciary duty could result in its refusing to register a particular transfer proposed by the Company.
If as a consequence of a failure to pay a call, the Company is treated as a defaulting investor under the relevant Fund, it will suffer a resultant dilution in interest and possibly the compulsory sale of its interest.
Commitment risk The nature of investing in buy-out and development capital funds entails making significant financial commitments, as shown in note 18.
At 31 December 2004, the Group had significant uncalled commitments of 464.5 million, compared to its consolidated net assets of 676.4 million.
It is anticipated that over the longer term, and in normal circumstances, commitments would be financed by distributions received on the realisation of existing investments.
In addition, the Group has a 285 million loan facility that could be drawn on to meet commitments as they fall due.
However, a residual risk remains that the Group could be unable to meet its future commitments in full.
