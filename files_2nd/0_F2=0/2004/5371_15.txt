Notes to the accounts continued 2 Segmental analysis Turnover and operating profit are reported for each of the Groups four operating divisions.
Analysis is reported for operating profit rather than profit before tax in order to reflect the fact that the following areas are managed by the corporate team and therefore not allocated to the divisions: share of operating profit of joint ventures and associated undertakings, profit on business disposals and net interest payable and other financing costs.
Proforma figures are also given for each media type to allow easier market and peer group comparisons.
The two analyses cross reference as follows: Emap Consumer Media comprises UK, US and International consumer magazines excluding France and automotive B2B activities.
Emap Communications comprises the majority of the Groups B2B activities plus healthcare related UK consumer magazines.
Emap Performance comprises all analogue and digital radio stations, music TV and music related consumer magazines and events.
Emap France comprises the Groups French consumer magazines.
The management of the Groups digital activities, previously reported as Emap Digital, has been the responsibility of the divisional management since January 2002.
However, the Group undertook to disclose separately the performance of its digital activities until 31 March 2003.
The segmental analysis is now presented with the digital activities within the four operating divisions and comparatives have been restated accordingly.
This reflects how the business and the digital activities are managed on a day-to-day basis.

During the year a common chart of accounts was introduced across all UK operations, and this has led to all costs and expenses in the current year being treated on a consistent basis.
Prior year costs and expenses have been restated, with certain salary costs being reclassified from cost of sales to administrative expenses.
Gross profit turnover less cost of sales amounted to 572m 2003 524m, all from continuing operations.

In all cases the assets of the schemes are held by independent custodians and are kept entirely separate from the assets of the Group.
No loans have been made by any scheme to any Group company and no shareholdings of the schemes have been used as security for any loans to any Group company.
i Defined contribution plan Flexiplan The pension charge for the year for Flexiplan represents contributions due from the employer and amounted to 4.7m 2003 3.4m with 0.4m 2003 0.3m outstanding at the year end.
ii Defined benefit plan Emap Earnings Related Pension Plan EERPP The pension charge for the year for EERPP was 3.5m 2003 0.5m.
Contributions are assessed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the staffs estimated remaining service lives within the Group.
The balance sheet contains a prepayment amounting to 5.3m 2003 4.4m.
The pension cost for the plan is assessed in accordance with the advice of an actuary.
For these purposes a valuation of the EERPP was carried out as at 5 April 2003 using the projected unit method.
In this valuation the assets were taken in at their market value of 66.6m.
A value was placed on the liabilities by discounting the anticipated future benefits, including allowances for future increases in plan pay and pensions in payment, using assumptions derived by reference to market conditions as at 5 April 2003.
The principal assumptions adopted were that existing investments would return 3.8% per annum in real terms ahead of price inflation assumed to be 2.6% per annum.
Furthermore, it was assumed that plan pay increases would exceed inflation by 1.5% per annum and Limited Price indexation increases awarded to pensions in payment would on average follow the rate of inflation.
The results of the valuation for funding purposes undertaken at 5 April 2003 were that the assets were sufficient to cover 64% of the plans liabilities.

Shares held in Trust in respect of Executive Share Schemes and in the Qualifying Employee Share Ownership Trust QUEST are excluded from the basic WANS but included in calculating the diluted WANS.
Earnings per share calculations are also presented below on a normalised basis.
Normalised earnings are calculated in accordance with the principles set out in Note 1 c.

In calculating profit into cash, operating cash flow, net of capital expenditure, is adjusted to exclude expenditure on non normalised transactions or events such as exceptional reorganisation and acquisition restructuring provisions and is then compared to normalised Group operating profit.

The proceeds have been used to repay existing debt.
Subsequently the Groups revolving credit facility has reduced from 650m to 525m.
13 Treasury information A discussion of the Groups treasury management policies can be found in the Finance Directors review on pages 10 and 11.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the following disclosures.
a Borrowing facilities The Groups borrowing limit at 31 March 2004 calculated in accordance with the Articles of Association was 1,625m 2003 1,283m.
At 31 March 2004, the Group had a 525m 2003 650m syndicated multi-currency revolving credit facility which matures in May 2006.
The Group had undrawn committed amounts under the 525m facility available at 31 March 2004 of 500m 2003 441m.
The Group also has short-term uncommitted credit facilities.
All of these facilities bear margins at market rates.
b Currency exposures The table below shows the extent to which Group companies have net monetary assets liabilities in currencies other than their functional currency at 31 March.
Net foreign exchange gains and losses arising on these assets liabilities are recognised in the profit and loss account of the individual companies and the Group.

i Borrowings The maturity profile of borrowings is provided in Note 22.
The currency and interest rate profile of the Groups borrowings, taking into account the effect of interest rate and cross currency swaps, is as follows: Fixed rate borrowings Fixed rate weighted borrowings average weighted interest average rate at time for Non-interest 31 March which rate 1 2 3 Floating rate Fixed rate bearing Total 2004 is fixed Note m m m m % Years Sterling 125 4 121 Euros 32 153 185 5.3 1.8 At 31 March 2004 157 153 4 306 1 Bank loans 52 2 50 2 Sterling Eurobond and related swaps 90 153 2 241 Loan notes 4 4 Amounts owed to associated undertakings 31 11 11 At 31 March 2004 157 153 4 306 At 31 March 2003 119 122 4 237 1 Bank loans and amounts owed to associated undertakings bear interest at rates fixed in advance for periods up to six months by reference to LIBOR.
2 The Sterling Eurobond has been swapped into floating rates of interest until its maturity in 2013.
A proportion of this floating rate debt has been swapped into Euro using foreign exchange swaps and the resulting Euro floating rate debt has been swapped to a fixed rate of interest using interest rate swaps.
In the previous year, fixed rate debt related to floating rate bank loans which had been swapped to a fixed rate of interest using interest rate swaps.
3 Non-interest bearing borrowings comprise unamortised arrangement fees.
Arrangement fees are amortised and charged in the Consolidated profit and loss account over the expected term of the related bank facility expiring in May 2006 and the Sterling Eurobond maturing in 2013. ii Onerous operating leases Property provisions at 31 March 2004 of 4m relate to onerous operating lease commitments: see Note 23 a.
The maturity profile of these leases is 1m falling due within one year, 2m falling due between two and five years and 1m after more than five years.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
This is because in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised at each half yearly reporting date to ensure that it reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.

Where available, third party market values have been used to determine fair values, otherwise fair values have been calculated by discounting expected cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

As such, any change in the value of the hedge will be generally offset by a change in the value of the underlying asset or liability.
f Hedges The table below shows the extent to which the Group has unrecognised or off balance sheet gains losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges, which principally comprise interest rate swaps.
All gains losses arising on these hedging instruments are expected to be matched by losses gains on the underlying assets or liabilities.

Valuations have been measured by reference to the greater of net realisable value and value in use.
Value in use has been calculated with reference to future expected pre-tax cash flows, discounted at a rate of 13.0%, the Groups pre-tax weighted average cost of capital.

This amounted to a total consideration of 92m, including 1m of acquisition costs, which was paid in cash.
On 15 March 2004 SRH completed the acquisition of Capital Radio Productions Limited and issued shares to settle a portion of the acquisition consideration.
This resulted in a dilution of the Groups shareholding in SRH from 27.8% to 27.1% which has been treated as a deemed disposal by the Group.
As a result, a write off of goodwill of 2m was recorded with a corresponding increase in post acquisition reserves: there was no profit or loss on the disposal.

A provision of 2m has been made relating to liabilities arising from the rights of journalists to take redundancy on the change of ownership.
A further 2m provision has been made relating to a deficit on the Companys funding of pension obligations.
