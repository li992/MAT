Under the SIP the company gives eligible employees free shares of up to 3,000 a year.
They can also purchase partnership shares for up to 1,500 a year that are matched 2 for 1 by the company.
The free and matching shares are purchased at fair value in the market and expensed at the time of allocation.

Both components have the same performance targets based on net asset value per share growth and a three year service period.
Performance shares are valued at the market value at the date of the award.
The options are valued using a Black-Scholes model adjusted for dividends according to the table below.
For both LTIP components the company estimates the number of shares or options likely to vest and expenses that value over the relevant period.
Volatility has been estimated by taking the historical volatility in the companys share price over a four year period and adjusting where there are known factors that may affect future volatility.
Vesting estimates take account of the companys high staff retention rate.
