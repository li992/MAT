ii The fair values of all quoted euro bonds are based on their closing clean market price converted at the spot rate of exchange as appropriate.
iii The fair values of the EIB loans have been calculated by discounting their future cash flows at market rates adjusted to reflect the redemption adjustments allowed under each agreement.
iv The fair values of unquoted debt have been calculated by discounting the estimated cash flows for each instrument at the appropriate market discount rate in the currency of issue in effect at the balance sheet date.
v The fair values of the sterling interest rate swaps and sterling forward rate agreements have been estimated by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows.
vi The fair values of the sterling interest rate swaptions are estimated using the sterling yield curve and implied volatilities as at 31 March.
vii The fair values of the cross-currency swaps have been estimated by adding the present values of the two sides of each swap.
The present value of each side of the swap is calculated by discounting the estimated future cash flows for that side, using the appropriate market discount rates for that currency in effect at the balance sheet date.
viii The fair values of the forward contracts are estimated using market forward exchange rates on 31 March.
ix The fair values of gas futures are the margin calls under those contracts.
x The fair values of weather derivatives have been estimated assuming for water related derivatives a normal water year in several water basins, and for temperature related derivatives a normal daily high temperature of certain cities in the US.

This does not include currency swaps used as part of the hedging of the US net investment.
Floating rate borrowings bear interest at rates based on LIBOR, certificate of deposit rates, interbank borrowing rates, prime rates or other short-term market rates.
The average interest rates on short-term borrowings as at 31 March 2004 were as follows: GBP 4.1%, USD 1.2% 2003 3.6% and 1.4% respectively.
Based on the floating rate debt of 1,559.7 million at 31 March 2004 2003 1,462.4 million, a 100 basis point change in interest rates would result in a 15.6 million change in profit before tax for the year 2003 14.6 million change.
Debt in the table above is reported by currency.
In the past it has been reported split by the location of issue, which has been the same as the currency split.
During the year the UK operations issued $700 million of convertible bonds which were not swapped into sterling.

The fair values of the financial assets are not materially different from their book values.
The group also has certain equity investments which have been excluded from the disclosures above because they have no maturity date.
As at 31 March 2004, the book value of these investments was 57.2 million 2003 68.9 million and the fair value was 55.2 million 2003 59.8 million.

The transactions included in the table above consist of forward purchase and sale contracts of electricity and forward purchase and sale contracts of gas and gas futures contracts.
These contracts are marked to market value using externally derived market prices and any gain or loss arising is recognised in the profit and loss account.
This is not in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 which requires that these contracts be stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value or that, if revalued, any revaluation difference be taken to revaluation reserve.
However, the directors consider that compliance with these requirements would lead to the Accounts failing to give a true and fair view of the results of the group since the marketability of energy trading contracts enables decisions to be made continually on whether to hold or sell them.
Accordingly, the measurement of profit in any period is properly made by reference to market values.
The effect of the departure on the Accounts is to increase the profit for the year by 4.6 million 2003 7.3 million and increase the groups net assets by 15.6 million 2003 11.0 million.
j Currency exposures As explained in the Financial Review on pages 33 to 61 the group uses forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and borrowings in foreign currencies to mitigate the currency exposures arising from its overseas net investments.
Gains and losses arising on overseas net investments and the forward contracts, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency borrowings used to hedge the currency exposures, are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.

The Special Share, which could be held only by one of the Secretaries of State or any other person acting on behalf of HM Government, did not carry rights to vote at the general or separate meetings but entitled the holder to attend and speak at such meetings.
Written consent of the Special Shareholder was required before certain provisions of the companys Articles of Association or certain rights attaching to the Special Share were varied.
This share conferred no rights to participate in the capital or profits of the company, except that in a winding up the Special Shareholder was entitled to repayment in priority to the other shareholders.
b Employee share schemes The group has six types of share based plans for employees.
Options have been granted and awards made to eligible employees to subscribe for ordinary shares or ADSs in Scottish Power plc in accordance with the rules of each plan.
The ScottishPower Sharesave Schemes are savings related and under normal circumstances share options are exercisable on completion of a three or five year save-as-you-earn contract as appropriate.
The Executive Share Option Scheme applied to executive directors and certain senior managers.
However, this Scheme was replaced with the Long Term Incentive Plan but options already granted were not affected.
The PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan PSIP relates to options over ScottishPower ADSs which vest over two or three years, as appropriate.
Awards granted under the Long Term Incentive Plan will vest only if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that certain performance measures related to the sustained underlying financial performance of the group and improvements in customer service standards are achieved over a period of three financial years commencing with the financial year preceding the date an award is made.
Options granted under the Executive Share Option Plan 2001 ExSOP to executive directors and certain senior managers in the UK are subject to the performance criterion that the percentage increase in the companys annualised earnings per share, excluding goodwill amortisation and exceptional items, be at least 3% adjusted for any increase in the RPI.
Options granted to US participants under the ExSOP, with the exception of the 2002 conditional award, are not subject to any performance criteria.
The 2002 conditional award is subject to the same performance criterion as awards to UK participants.
The Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP allows eligible employees to make contributions from pre-tax salary to buy shares in ScottishPower which are held in trust Partnership Shares.
These shares are matched by the company Matching Shares and are also held in trust.
At the launch of the ESOP, Free Shares were offered to employees.
The K Plus Plan consists of the K Plus Employee Savings Plan and the K Plus Employee Stock Ownership Plan.
The K Plan Employee Savings Plan is a 401 k based qualified retirement plan designed to provide income during employees retirement.
The K Plus Employee Stock Ownership Plan provides for matching contributions by PacifiCorp based on employees contributions, plus additional discretionary employer contributions made to all eligible employees.
## PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan are options over ScottishPower ADSs: for the purpose of the table above, ADSs have been converted to ScottishPower shares as follows: one ScottishPower ADS equals four ScottishPower ordinary shares.
Eligibility for participation in the ExSOP was extended during the previous year to certain senior managers in the US.
Consequently, no new options were granted in the prior year nor in the current year under the PSIP, nor is it intended to grant any new PSIP options in the future.
For the purpose of the table above, such options have been converted to ScotishPower ordinary shares as follows: one ScottishPower ADS equals four ScottishPower ordinary shares.
The US$ ADS option exercise price was converted so that it may be represented in terms of ScottishPower ordinary shares.
The price was further converted at the closing exchange rate on 31 March 2004 to be quoted in pence in the table above.
Eligibility for participation in the Executive Share Option Plan 2001 was extended during the prior year to executive directors and certain senior managers in the US.
Consequently, no new options were granted in the year under the PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan nor is it intended to grant any new PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan options in the future.
Options become exercisable in the following proportions: one third on the first anniversary of grant, a further one third on the second anniversary of grant, and the final one third on the third anniversary of grant.
Options became exercisable in the proportions 50% on 11 May 2000 and the remaining 50% on 11 May 2001.
Options became exercisable in the following proportions: one quarter after 1 September 2001, one quarter after 1 September 2002 and the remaining one half after 1 September 2003.
Where reference is made to PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan, this is to identify the plan under which the options over ScottishPower ADSs have been granted.
For the PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan, the date of grant refers to the date the original PacifiCorp Common Stock options were granted.
These options were exchanged for options over ScottishPower ADSs following the acquisition on 29 November 1999. iii Shares in the company held under trust during the year are as follows: Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at value at value at 1 April acquired transferred 31 March 31 March 31 March Dividends 2002 during year during year 2003 2003 2003 2002 03 Notes waived 000s 000s 000s 000s m m Long Term Incentive Plan a no 3,688 218 3,470 1.7 13.0 ScottishPower Sharesave Schemes b yes 8,323 2,064 6,259 3.1 23.5 Executive Share Option Plan 2001 c yes 2,360 7,387 9,747 4.9 36.6 PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan d no 160 54 106 0.1 0.4 Employee Share Ownership Plan e no 2,182 1,574 755 3,001 1.5 11.3 16,713 8,961 3,091 22,583 11.3 84.8 Shares Shares Nominal Market held at Shares Shares held at value at value at 1 April acquired transferred 31 March 31 March 31 March Dividends 2003 during year during year 2004 2004 2004 2003 04 Notes waived 000s 000s 000s 000s m m Long Term Incentive Plan a no 3,470 664 155 3,979 2.0 15.2 ScottishPower Sharesave Schemes b yes 6,259 16 6,243 3.1 23.8 Executive Share Option Plan 2001 c yes 9,747 5,901 102 15,546 7.8 59.2 PacifiCorp Stock Incentive Plan d no 106 47 59 0.2 Employee Share Ownership Plan e no 3,001 1,404 590 3,815 1.9 14.5 22,583 7,969 910 29,642 14.8 112.9 118 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 25 Share capital continued a Shares of the company are held under trust as part of the Long Term Incentive Plan for executive directors and other senior managers see Remuneration Report of the Directors on pages 72 to 83 for details of the Plan.

The new plans were a defined benefit plan Final Salary LifePlan which is open to continuous contract employees aged between 16 and 60, and a defined contribution plan Money Purchase LifePlan which was subsequently closed to new entrants with effect from 31 August 2003 and is currently in the process of being wound up with all assets and liabilities to be transferred to the Final Salary LifePlan.
The result of these changes in the UK pension arrangements is that the age profile of the two closed defined benefit schemes is expected to rise over time, due to the lack of new entrants.
This will in turn result in increasing service costs for these two schemes due to the method of actuarial valuation used the projected unit method.
However, the same method is also used for the Final Salary LifePlan, which is open to new members and whose age profile is not expected to rise significantly in the short to medium term.
Overall, the group believes that the projected unit method is appropriate when adopted across all schemes closed and open, and in aggregate provides a reasonable basis for assessing the group's pension costs.
Further details of the US arrangements are given in sub-note f below.
Each of the pension schemes are invested in an appropriately diversified range of equities, bonds, property and private markets.
The broad proportions of each asset class in which the schemes aim to be invested are as follows, however it is important to note that this may vary from time to time as markets change and as cash may be held for strategic reasons.
Private Equities Bonds Property markets Total %%%%% ScottishPower 65 29 6 100 Manweb 65 35 100 Final Salary LifePlan 100 100 PacifiCorp pension 55 34 11 100 PacifiCorp healthcare 63 35 2 100 In broad terms, the investment strategies adopted by the schemes aim to ensure that sufficient assets are available to meet scheme liabilities as they fall due.
The ScottishPower and Manweb schemes' investment strategies reflect the large and growing proportion of their liabilities which relate to pensions in payment, and therefore include a growing bond element.
A significant equity element is still retained, however, to provide potential for long-term outperformance relative to bonds and therefore to reduce the group's contribution requirements.
For the Final Salary LifePlan, the strategy remains 100% equities due to its young membership with on average over 20 years' duration until retirement: with such a long-term until liabilities fall due, the group and trustees have agreed that a fully equity-oriented strategy remains appropriate.
US arrangements are managed and invested in accordance with all applicable requirements, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act ERISA and the Internal Revenue Service IRS revenue code the ERISA is the US legislation which regulates pension institutions in a number of areas.
PacifiCorp employs an investment approach whereby a mix of equities and fixed income investments are used to maximise the long-term return of plan assets for a prudent level of risk.
Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, plan funded status, and corporate financial condition.
The investment portfolio contains a diversified blend of equity and fixed income investments.
Equity investments are diversified across US and non-US stocks, as well as growth, value, small and large capitalisation.
Fixed income investments are diversified across US and non-US bonds.
Other assets such as private equity are used judiciously to enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversification.
PacifiCorp primarily minimises the risk of large losses through diversification but also monitors and manages other aspects of risk through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset liability studies.
ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 121 Accounts 2003 04 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2004 28 Pensions and other post-retirement benefits continued b ScottishPower Scottish Power UK plc operates a funded pension scheme of the company providing defined retirement and death benefits based on final pensionable salary.
This scheme was open prior to 1 January 1999 to employees of ScottishPower.
Members are required to contribute to the Scheme at a rate of 5% of pensionable salary.
Scottish Power UK plc meets the balance of cost of providing benefits, and company contributions paid are based on the results of the formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme and are agreed by Scottish Power UK plc and the Scheme Trustees.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the company in a trustee administered fund.
Included in the Scheme assets are 116,797 ScottishPower shares 444,705, based on market value as at 31 March 2004, purchased only as part of a pooled strategy to match the relative weightings in the UK Stock Exchange index.
The pension charge for the year is based on the advice of the Schemes independent qualified actuary and is calculated using assumptions that were applied to a formal review of the Scheme at 30 September 2003.
The amount included in the balance sheet represents the difference between the accumulated excess of the actual contributions paid to the Scheme and the pension accounting charge.
The net pension charge is derived from a regular cost of 21.1% of salaries, offset by a variation credit of 6.1% of salaries.
The variation credit is calculated as the assessed surplus, as adjusted for the balance sheet amount, spread as a fixed percentage of pensionable salaries over 13 years.
Following the formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2003, employer contributions of 15% of pensionable salaries werereinstated from that date.
c Manweb Prior to 1 January 1999, most of the Manweb employees were entitled to join the Manweb Group of the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme, which provides pension and other related benefits based on final pensionable salary to employees throughout the Electricity Supply Industry in England & Wales.
The ongoing contributions to the Scheme are based on the results of the formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme and the advice of the Scheme Actuary.
The assets are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The Scheme assets no longer include any ScottishPower shares.
For funding and expensing purposes the Scheme assets are taken at market value plus a smoothing adjustment appropriate at the valuation date.
The pension charge for the year is based on advice from an independent qualified actuary and is calculated using assumptions that were applied to a formal review of the Scheme as at 30 September 2003.
The net pension charge is derived from a regular cost of 13.9% of salaries, increased by a variation cost of 8.1% of salaries.
The variation cost is calculated as the assessed deficit at the valuation date, spread as a fixed percentage of pensionable salaries over 13 years.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year ranged between 8.1% and 14.1% for different sections of membership but tending towards the higher rates, or other rates for particular groups or as required by a business transfer agreement.
The rates of contributions payable will be reviewed following the results of the formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme as at 31 March 2004. d Southern Water The sale of Southern Water to First Aqua Limited First Aqua was concluded on 23 April 2002.
The figures in this Note relate purely to the charge arising prior to this date.
There is no impact in respect of pensions on the groups balance sheet as a result of the sale of Southern Water, as the Southern Water Scheme had not given rise to any prepayment or provision at the time of the sale.
Southern Water operated a funded pension scheme.
Members were required to contribute to the Scheme at varying rates of pensionable salary depending upon category of membership.
The company met the balance of the cost of the accruing benefits.
Contributions paid were based on the results of the formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme and were agreed by the company and the Scheme Trustees.
The assets were held in a separate trustee administered fund.
For funding and expensing purposes, the Scheme assets were taken at market value.
The pension charge for the period prior to disposal on 23 April 2002, of 10% of pensionable salaries, plus employer augmentation costs, was based on the advice of the Schemes independent qualified actuary and was calculated using the same assumptions as at the last formal actuarial valuation of the Scheme.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers for the period were 10% of pensionable salaries, except where required by a business transfer agreement.
Following the sale of Southern Water on 23 April 2002, the sponsorship of the Southern Water Scheme passed to First Aqua, with no further payments due by ScottishPower after that date.
Therefore there are no consequent liabilities in respect of this Scheme.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 March 2004 was nil 2003 0.2 million, 2002 4.1 million.
The employer contribution for the year ended 31 March 2004 was nil 2003 0.2 million.
The provision as at 31 March 2004 was nil 2003 nil.
e Final Salary LifePlan The group operates a funded pension scheme providing defined retirement and death benefits based on final pensionable salary for eligible UK employees of the group.
The assets of the LifePlan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The pension charge for the year, of 11.4% of pensionable salaries, is based on the advice of the LifePlans independent qualified actuary, representing the assessed balance of cost of the accruing benefits after allowing for members contributions of 5% of pensionable salaries.
The same actuarial assumptions have been adopted for both funding and expensing purposes.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were 11.4% of pensionable salaries, except where required by a business transfer agreement.
There are no planned changes to employer contribution requirements.
f PacifiCorp PacifiCorp operates pension plans covering substantially all its employees.
Benefits are based on the employees years of service and final pensionable salary, adjusted to reflect estimated social security benefits.
Pension costs are funded annually by no more than the maximum amount of pension expense which can be deducted for federal income tax purposes.
The PacifiCorp pensions figures in these Accounts include the unfunded SERP.
PacifiCorp meets the entire cost of accruing benefits under PacifiCorp plans.
The assets for the funded Plan are held in a separate fund.
For funding and expensing purposes, the Plan assets are valued at market levels, and liabilities costed on financial assumptions in line with market return expectations.
The pension charge for the year is based on the advice of the Plans independent qualified actuary and is assessed on the results of the formal actuarial valuation carried out as at 1 January 2003.
Equity markets were much lower at the valuation date than at the previous valuation date 1 January 2002 used for the 2002 03 figures.
This has led to a significantly higher variation cost for the year ending 31 March 2004.
The two other components of the pension charge, namely the regular cost and the interest cost, are broadly similar for the previous year.
The net pension charge is derived from a regular cost of 6.9% of salaries, an interest cost of 2.4% of salaries, and a variation cost of 9.5% of salaries.
The variation cost is calculated as the assessed deficit, as adjusted for the balance sheet amount, spread as a fixed percentage of pensionable salaries over 11 years.
The actual contributions payable by participating employers during the year were 11.2% of pensionable earnings.
The employers planned contributions for 2004 05 are 16.7% of pensionable earnings.
PacifiCorp also provides other post-retirement benefits to certain employees.
The group has provided 48.6 million as at 31 March 2004 2003 55.0 million for these benefits.
The related charge for the year was 17.0 million 2003 14.3 million.
Further details of these benefits are disclosed in Note 34. g Additional pension arrangements Until 31 August 2003 the group operated an approved defined contribution pension scheme Money Purchase LifePlan for eligible employees.
Contributions were paid by the member and employer at fixed rates.
The benefits secured at retirement or death reflect each employees accumulated fund and the cost of purchasing benefits at that time.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee administered fund, although this is to be wound up with the assets and liabilities due to be transferred into the Final Salary LifePlan.
The pension charge for the year represents the defined employer contribution and amounted to nil 2003 0.1 million.
The group also operates pension arrangements for senior executives, namely the ScottishPower Executive Top-Up Plan for benefits which are held within UK Inland Revenue limits and the Unfunded Unapproved Retirement Benefit Scheme UURBS for benefits beyond these limits.
The UURBS has no invested assets and the group has provided 11.3 million as at 31 March 2004 2003 9.5 million for the benefit promises which will ultimately be paid by the group.
Further details of the groups pensions arrangements, as required under US GAAP, are disclosed in Note 34.

The UK pension arrangements net pension liability asset comprises assets net of deferred tax of 0.5 million 2003 nil, 2002 159.1 million and liabilities net of deferred tax of 120.9 million 2003 230.5 million, 2002 35.3 million.

For the UK pension arrangements, the long-term rates of return have been derived as follows: Equities: the long-term UK Government fixed interest stock yield, plus 3% p. a.
Bonds: an appropriate weighted average of long-term UK Government and UK corporate bond yields reflecting the actual split of holdings.
Property: the long-term equities rate of return less 1% p. a.
Cash: the current UK base rate of interest.
In all cases, for FRS17 reporting purposes the long-term rates of return have been reduced by 0.3% p. a.
2003 0.3% p. a. to reflect scheme expenses to arrive at the figures shown above.
For the US pension and other post-retirement healthcare arrangements, the long-term rates of return have been derived as follows: Equities: An expected real return of 6.25% plus 3% long-term inflation.
Bonds: An expected real return of 3.50% plus 3% long-term inflation.
Cash: An expected real return of 1% plus 3% long-term inflation.
Private markets: An expected real return of 11% plus 3% long-term inflation.
These return assumptions are based on both historical performance and independent advisors' forward-looking views of the financial markets.

This gave rise to a contingent liability to corporation tax on chargeable gains, estimated at amounts up to 570 million.
On 19 March 2002, the group demerged its residual holding in Thus Group plc the new holding company of Thus plc.
The charge referred to above could still arise, in certain circumstances, before 19 March 2007.
Members of the ScottishPower group have agreed to indemnify Thus Group plc for any such liability, except in circumstances arising without the consent of the ScottishPower group.
Legal proceedings In May 2004, PacifiCorp was served with a complaint filed in the US District Court for the District of Oregon by the Klamath Tribes of Oregon and certain of the KlamathTribes members.
The claim generally alleges that PacifiCorp and its predecessors affected the Klamath Tribes federal treaty rights to fish for salmon in the headwaters of the Klamath River in southern Oregon by building dams that blocked the passage of salmon upstream to the headwaters beginning in 1911.
The claim seeks in excess of $1.0 billion in damages.
PacifiCorp believes it has a number of defences and intends to vigorously defend any claim of liability for the matters alleged by the Klamath Tribes.
The groups businesses are parties to various other legal claims, actions and complaints, certain of which involve material amounts.
Although the group is unable to predict with certainty whether or not it will ultimately be successful in these legal proceedings or, if not, what the impact might be, the directors currently believe that disposition of these matters will not have a materially adverse effect on the groups consolidated Accounts.

As part of its UK energy resource portfolio, ScottishPower is committed under long-term purchase contracts to purchases of 1,180.7 million, 460.0 million, 223.3 million, 163.3 million and 103.2 million for the years 2005 to 2009 respectively and 245.3 million thereafter.
ii PacifiCorp contractual commitments Long-term wholesale sales and purchased power contracts In the US, PacifiCorp manages its energy resource requirements by integrating long-term firm, short-term and spot market purchases with its own generating resources to economically operate the system within the boundaries of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission requirements and meet commitments for wholesale sales and retail load growth.
The long-term wholesale sales commitments include contracts with minimum sales requirements of 145.1 million, 122.5 million, 102.3 million, 82.0 million and 74.2 million for the years 2005 to 2009 respectively and 0.5 billion thereafter.
As part of its energy resource portfolio, PacifiCorp acquires a portion of its power through long-term purchases and or exchange agreements which require minimum fixed payments of 232.2 million, 237.5 million, 217.7 million, 156.1 million and 140.5 million for the years 2005 to 2009 respectively, and 1.4 billion thereafter.
Excluded from the minimum fixed annual payments above are commitments to purchase power from several hydroelectric projects under long-term arrangements with public utility districts.
These purchases are made on a cost-of-service basis for a stated percentage of project output and for a like percentage of project annual costs operating expenses and debt service.
PacifiCorp is required to pay its portion of operating expenses and its portion of the debt service, whether or not any power is produced.
The arrangements provide for non-withdrawable power and the majority also provide for additional power, withdrawable by the public utility districts upon one to five years notice.
For 2004, these purchases represented approximately 2.3% of PacifiCorps energy requirements.
At 31 March 2004, PacifiCorps share of long-term arrangements with public utility districts were as follows: Annual Year contract Percentage costs Generating facility expires of output Capacity kW m Wanapum 2009 18.7% 155,444 3.9 Priest Rapids 2005 13.9% 109,602 2.4 Rocky Reach 2011 5.3% 64,297 2.2 Wells 2018 6.9% 59,617 1.3 Total 388,960 9.8 The annual costs include debt service costs of 3.8 million.
PacifiCorps minimum debt service obligation at 31 March 2004 was 3.3 million and for the years 2005 to 2009 are 3.5 million, 4.4 million, 6.1 million, 6.0 million and 6.6 million respectively.
Short-term wholesale sales and purchased power contracts At 31 March 2004, PacifiCorp had short-term wholesale forward sales commitments that included contracts with minimum sales requirements of 197.3 million, 91.6 million and 24.7 million for the years 2005 to 2007 respectively.
At 31 March 2004, short-term forward purchase agreements require minimum fixed payments of 152.0 million, 46.8 million and 8.3 million for the years 2005 to 2007 respectively.
Fuel contracts PacifiCorp has take or pay coal and natural gas contracts that require minimum fixed payments of 139.0 million, 196.0 million, 93.5 million, 88.8 million and 74.6 million for the years 2005 to 2009 respectively and 428.3 million thereafter.
iii PPM contractual commitments At 31 March 2004, PPM had purchase commitments of 475.3 million of which 251.1 million relates to the years 2005 to 2009.
PPMs contractual commitments primarily consist of electricity and gas purchases made to optimise returns from generation resources and commercial activities.

The net assets disposed of were as follows: Notes m Tangible fixed assets 16, i 2,474.7 Fixed asset investments 17 1.9 Current assets 193.1 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year Loans and other borrowings: Inter-company loan 756.4 Bank overdraft 6.2 Other creditors 291.2 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Loans and other borrowings 100.0 Provisions for liabilities and charges Deferred tax 22 361.0 Other provisions 23 5.6 Deferred income 24 37.4 Book value of Southern Water net assets disposed 1,111.9 Gain on disposal i Net disposal proceeds 1,111.9 Satisfied by: Cash received for net assets ii 1,187.3 Cash expenses 47.9 Net disposal cash proceeds 1,139.4 Accrued expenses 27.5 Net disposal proceeds 1,111.9 i In the year ended 31 March 2002, an exceptional impairment provision of 449.3 million was made to reduce the carrying value of Southern Waters net assets to their recoverable amount.
In addition, a further exceptional charge of 738.2 million was recognised representing the impairment of goodwill on the acquisition of Southern Water previously written off to reserves.
As a consequence of these charges to profits in the year ended 31 March 2002, there was no further gain or loss required to be recognised for the year ended 31 March 2003 on completion of the sale.

The demerger of Thus was preceded by an open offer of approximately 275 million of new equity shares in Thus which resulted in ScottishPowers equity interest in Thus temporarily increasing from 50.1% to 72.4%, and an increase in goodwill of 34.4 million.
Thus results for the period to 19 March 2002 were reported under discontinued operations in the ScottishPower Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2002.
The demerger of Thus was accounted for as a dividend in specie.

Additionally, UK GAAP requires that on subsequent disposal of these entities any goodwill previously taken directly to reserves is then charged in the profit and loss account against the profit or loss on disposal.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 31 March 1998 is capitalised and amortised through the profit and loss account over its useful economic life.
The goodwill adjustment is made to recognise goodwill previously written off to reserves under UK GAAP as an intangible asset under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, following the introduction of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No.
142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets FAS 142 which was effective for the group from 1 April 2002, goodwill arising from the purchase of operating entities should be held as an indefinite lived intangible asset in the balance sheet and is no longer amortised.
Instead goodwill is subject to an impairment test performed at least annually.
The adjustment Amortisation of goodwill for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 represents the reversal of amortisation of goodwill charged under UK GAAP.
The impact of reporting under FAS 142 for the year ended 31 March 2002 would have been to reduce the loss under US GAAP by 172.5 million to 714.5 million and to reduce the loss per share under US GAAP by 9.38 pence per share to 38.88 pence per share.
The group has completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis under FAS 142 as at 30 September 2003 and has concluded that goodwill is not impaired.
The following table provides an analysis of goodwill included in the balance sheet under US GAAP for the years ended 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003.
130 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued 2004 2003 Notes m m Net book value of goodwill capitalised under US GAAP: At 1 April 2,677.6 2,937.7 Acquisition 12.4 Business combinations i 36.7 Exchange 295.5 235.8 As at 31 March ii 2,382.1 2,677.6 i The Business combinations adjustment of 36.7 million related to deferred tax provisions recognised on the acquisition of PacifiCorp.
ii The net book value of goodwill capitalised under US GAAP is analysed by business segment in the table below: 31 March 31 March 2004 2003 Note m m UK Division Integrated Generation and Supply 562.9 562.9 PacifiCorp i 1,808.5 2,102.3 PPM i 10.7 12.4 United States total 1,819.2 2,114.7 Total 2,382.1 2,677.6 i Year-on-year movements on the net book value of goodwill capitalised for PacifiCorp of 293.8 million and PPM of 1.7 million relate solely to foreign exchange.
Business combinations In addition to re-instating the goodwill calculated under UK GAAP as described above, goodwill must also be recalculated in accordance with US GAAP.
This is required due to differences between UK GAAP and US GAAP in the determination of acquisition price and valuation of assets and liabilities at the acquisition date.
The adjustment referred to as Business combinations reflects principally the impact of recalculating the goodwill arising on the acquisitions of Manweb and PacifiCorp under US GAAP.
The Business combinations adjustment of 31.6 million 22.1 million net of tax reflected in the reconciliation of profit loss to US GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2003 represented the difference between UK GAAP and US GAAP in accounting for accruals recognised under UK GAAP when PacifiCorp was acquired.
In cases where traded equity securities are exchanged as consideration, UK GAAP requires the fair value of consideration to be determined at the date the transaction is completed, while US GAAP requires the fair value of such consideration to be determined at the date the acquisition is announced.
ii Disposal of businesses Under UK GAAP the loss on disposal of and withdrawal from Appliance Retailing and the provision for loss on disposal of Southern Water were calculated based on net asset value, together with the goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Under US GAAP the same methodology was applied, however the net asset value under US GAAP differed from that under UK GAAP.
The principal differences relate to the amortisation of goodwill which had been recognised as an intangible asset under US GAAP but had been written off to reserves under UK GAAP and the revaluation of certain tangible fixed assets, which is not permitted under US GAAP but is permitted under UK GAAP.
iii US regulatory net assets FAS 71 Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation establishes US GAAP for utilities in the US whose regulators have the power to approve and or regulate rates that may be charged to customers.
FAS 71 provides that regulatory assets may be capitalised if it is probable that future revenue in an amount at least equal to the capitalised costs will result from the inclusion of that cost in allowable costs for ratemaking purposes.
Due to the different regulatory environment, no equivalent GAAP applies in the UK.
Under UK GAAP, the groups policy is to recognise regulatory assets established in accordance with FAS 71 only where they comprise rights or other access to future economic benefits which have arisen as a result of past transactions or events which have created an obligation to transfer economic benefits to a third party.
Measurement of the past transaction or event and hence the regulatory asset, is determined in accordance with UK GAAP.
The impact of the application of different accounting policies is that US regulatory net assets amounting to 724.7 million 2003 1,007.9 million are not recognised under UK GAAP, including deferred excess power costs, certain FAS 133 regulatory balances and certain pension regulatory balances.
Profits under US GAAP are consequently decreased by 81.2 million in 2004 2003 121.6 million.
US regulatory net assets relating to the PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs are discussed in note viii below.
iv Pension costs The fundamental differences between UK GAAP as represented by SSAP 24 and US GAAP are as follows: a Under UK GAAP, the annual pension charge is determined so that it is a substantially level percentage of the current and expected future payroll.
Under US GAAP, the aim is to accrue the cost of providing pension benefits in the year in which the employee provides the related service in accordance with FAS 87, which requires re-adjustment of the significant actuarial assumptions annually to reflect current market and economic conditions.
b Under UK GAAP, pension liabilities are usually discounted using an interest rate that represents the expected long-term return on plan assets.
Under US GAAP, pension liabilities are discounted using the current rates at which the pension liability could be settled.
c Under UK GAAP, variations from plan can be aggregated and amortised over the remaining employee service lives.
Under US GAAP, variations from plan must be amortised separately over remaining service lives.
d Under UK GAAP, alternative bases can be used to value plan assets.
Under US GAAP, plan assets should be valued at market or at market related values and where the fair market value of the plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation a minimum pension liability is then recognised as a charge to other comprehensive income under the provisions of FAS 87 unless and to the extent that FAS 71 can be applied in which case a pension regulatory asset is recognised.
ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 131 Accounts 2003 04 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2004 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued v Impairment on demerger of Thus Under UK GAAP, the demerger dividend was calculated based on the book value of the net assets disposed of as a result of demerger.
Under US GAAP, the demerger dividend was calculated based on the market value of the shares at the demerger date and the difference between this and the book value of net assets disposed of was disclosed as an impairment charge under US GAAP.
vi Revaluation of fixed assets The revaluation of assets is not permitted under US GAAP.
The reconciliation therefore adjusts fixed assets to historical cost and the depreciation charge has been adjusted accordingly.
vii Decommissioning and mine reclamation liabilities Under UK GAAP, future decommissioning and mine reclamation costs are provided for on a discounted basis with a corresponding increase to the cost of the asset.
This increased cost is depreciated over the useful life of the asset.
Under US GAAP, legal obligations associated with decommissioning and mine reclamation costs are accounted for on a similar basis in accordance with FAS 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations FAS 143.
Details of the cumulative adjustment arising onthe implementation of FAS 143 are given in Note 34 g. For other decommissioning and mine reclamation costs, regulated industries rateably accrue these costs and include them within US regulatory net assets, as the costs are recovered in depreciation rates.
viii PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs Under UK GAAP, PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs were recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account at the date of the announcement of the Plan.
Costs were provided for in accordance with FRS 12 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Under US GAAP, PacifiCorp Transition Plan costs are accounted for as regulatory assets and are being amortised through the income statement.
Costs have been accounted for in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force No.
94-3 Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring and FAS 88 Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits.
ix FAS 133 derivative instruments and hedging activities Under UK GAAP derivatives designated as used for non-trading purposes are accounted for on a consistent basis with the asset, liability or position being hedged.
Under US GAAP, the group applies FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 138 Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities and FAS 149 Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and guidance issued by the Derivative Implementation Group.
The adjustments in the reconciliations of profit loss and equity shareholders funds to US GAAP described as FAS 133 comprise FAS 133 and subsequent revising standards, FAS 138 and FAS 149, together with guidance issued by the Derivatives Implementation Group.
Effective from 1 April 2002, the group adopted revised FAS 133 guidance issued by the Derivatives Implementation Group under Revised Issue C15 Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception for Certain Option-Type Contracts and Forward Contracts in Electricity and Issue C16 Applying the Normal Purchases and Normal Sales Exception to Contracts that Combine a Forward Contract and a Purchased Option Contract.
This new guidance had the effect of including an increased number of the groups contracts within the scope of FAS 133.
The cumulative adjustment to profit under US GAAP for the year ended 31 March 2003 as a result of adopting Revised Issue C15 and Issue C16 was an increase to profit of 228.6 million 141.1 million, net of tax.
FAS 133 requires recognition of all derivatives, as defined in the standard, on the balance sheet at fair value.
Derivatives, or any portion thereof, that are not an effective hedge, are adjusted to fair value through income.
If a derivative qualifies as an effective hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged asset, liability, or firm commitment recognised in income, or are recognised in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged items are recognised in earnings.
The effects of changes in fair value of certain derivative instruments entered into to hedge future retail resource requirements in the groups US regulated business are subject to regulation and therefore are deferred pursuant to FAS 71.
The FAS 133 adjustment included within equity shareholders funds at 31 March 2004 of 2.2 million includes a net liability of 229.7 million which is subject to regulation and is therefore offset by a US regulatory asset of 229.7 million.
Contracts that qualify as normal purchases and normal sales are excluded from the requirements of FAS 133.
The realised gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the income statement at the contract settlement date.
x Deferred tax Under UK GAAP, FRS 19 Deferred tax, requires full provision for deferred tax at future enacted rates.
Provision is only made in respect of assets revalued for accounting purposes where a commitment exists to sell the asset at the balance sheet date.
Under US GAAP, full provision for deferred tax is required to the extent that accounting profit differs from taxable profit due to temporary timing differences.
Provision is made based on enacted tax law.
The item Effect of US GAAP adjustments reflects the additional impact of making full provision for deferred tax in respect of adjustments made in restating the balance sheet to US GAAP.
The item Effect of differences in methodology reflects the impact of making full provision for deferred tax under US GAAP compared to UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP the group recognised a 48.0 million tax credit through reserves as tax on translation differences on foreign currency hedging as a result of the application of the transitional rules contained in the Finance Act 2002, Schedule 26.
Under US GAAP, this 48.0 million tax credit has been recognised within the income statement as required by FAS 109 Accounting for Income Taxes.
xi Cash dividends Under UK GAAP, final ordinary cash dividends are recognised in the financial year in respect of which they are proposed by the Board of Directors.
Under US GAAP, such dividends are not recognised until they are formally declared by the Board of Directors.
132 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued xii Earnings loss per share Earnings loss per ordinary share have been calculated by dividing the profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the financial year, based on the following information: 2004 2003 2002 Basic earnings loss per share Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 741.6 789.3 887.0 Basic weighted average share capital number of shares, millions 1,829.5 1,843.9 1,837.8 Earnings per share under US GAAP continuing operations 40.57p 35.76p 19.15p Loss per share under US GAAP discontinued operations 0.60 p 64.06 p Earnings loss per share under US GAAP before cumulative adjustment for FAS 143 2003 C15 and C16, 2002 FAS 133 40.57p 35.16p 44.91 p Loss earnings per share under US GAAP cumulative adjustment for FAS 143 2003 C15 and C16, 2002 FAS 133 0.03 p 7.65p 3.35 p Earnings loss per share under US GAAP 40.54p 42.81p 48.26 p Diluted earnings loss per share Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 740.7 789.3 887.0 Diluted weighted average share capital number of shares, millions 1,890.2 1,848.4 1,840.1 Diluted earnings per share under US GAAP continuing operations 39.22p 35.67p 19.15p Diluted loss per share under US GAAP discontinued operations 0.60 p 64.06 p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP before cumulative adjustment for FAS 143 2003 C15 and C16, 2002 FAS 133 39.22p 35.07p 44.91 p Diluted loss earnings per share under US GAAP cumulative adjustment for FAS 143 2003 C15 and C16, 2002 FAS 133 0.03 p 7.63p 3.35 p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 39.19p 42.70p 48.26 p The difference between the basic earnings loss for the financial year under US GAAP and the diluted earnings loss for the financial year under US GAAP is attributable to the interest charged on the convertible bonds of 7.1 million and the mark to market gain on the convertible bonds of 8.0 million.
The difference between the basic and the diluted weighted average share capital is wholly attributable to outstanding share options and shares held in trust for the groups employee share schemes and the convertible bonds.
In accordance with FAS 128 Earnings per share the diluted loss per share for the year ended 31 March 2002 does not assume the exercise of securities that have an antidilutive effect on the loss per share.
The loss per share for March 2003 and 2002 for discontinued operations have been calculated based on US GAAP earnings which are net of 3.0 million and 49.0 million, respectively of interest and similar charges and a tax credit charge of 4.6 million and 15.2 million, respectively.
The groups charge for interest and similar charges has been allocated between continuing and discontinued operations on the basis of external and internal borrowings of the respective operations.
As permitted under UK GAAP, earnings loss per share have been presented including and excluding the impact of exceptional items and goodwill amortisation to provide an additional measure of underlying performance.
UK GAAP permits the presentation of more than one measure of earnings loss per share provided that all such measures are clearly explained and given equal prominence on the face of the profit and loss account.
In accordance with US GAAP, earnings loss per share have been presented above based on US GAAP earnings loss, without adjustments for the impact of UK GAAP exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
Such additional measures of underlying performance are not permitted under US GAAP.
xiii ESOP shares held in trust In previous years UK GAAP required that shares held by employee share ownership trusts be recorded as fixed asset investments less amounts written off.
As a result of the implementation of UITF 38 this treatment has been revised as described in detail in Note 17.
Under US GAAP in previous years shares held in trust were recorded as a deduction from shareholders' funds to the extent that they had no performance conditions attached.
The US GAAP adjustment for ESOP shares held under trust is no longer required.
xiv Other Other differences between UK and US GAAP are not individually material and relate to post-retirement benefits other than pensions, capitalisation of finance costs, investment tax credits, available-for-sale securities and stock option compensation expense.
UK GAAP permits the use of long-term discount rates in determining the provision for post-retirement benefits other than pensions.
US GAAP requires the use of current market rates.
Under UK GAAP, only interest on debt funding may be capitalised during the period of construction.
Under US GAAP, as applied by regulated electricity utilities, both the cost of debt and the cost of equity applicable to domestic utility properties are capitalised during the period of construction.
Under US GAAP, investment tax credits for PacifiCorp are deferred and amortised to income over periods prescribed by PacifiCorps various regulatory jurisdictions.
Available-for-sale securities UK GAAP permits fixed asset investments to be valued at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
US GAAP requires that such investments, insofar as they are availablefor-sale securities, are marked to market with movements in market value being included in other comprehensive income.

As the group applies APB 25 in accounting for its plans, under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation FAS 123, it has adopted the disclosure only option in relation to its share option schemes.
Had the group determined compensation cost based on the fair value at the grant date for its share options under FAS 123, the groups profit loss for financial year under US GAAP and earnings loss per share under US GAAP would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts below: 2004 2003 2002 Profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 741.6 789.3 887.0 Reversal of APB 25 stock compensation expense included within the Other adjustment million 2.8 3.6 4.4 Stock compensation expense calculated under FAS 123 million 4.6 6.1 7.4 Pro forma profit loss for the financial year under US GAAP million 739.8 786.8 890.0 Basic earnings loss per share under US GAAP 40.54p 42.81p 48.26 p Pro forma basic earnings loss per share under US GAAP 40.44p 42.67p 48.43 p Diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 39.19p 42.70p 48.26 p Pro forma diluted earnings loss per share under US GAAP 39.09p 42.57p 48.43 p The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year was 6.0 million 2003 6.3 million, 2002 8.6 million.

There are other GAAP differences, not included in the reconciliations, which would affect the classification of assets and liabilities or of income and expenditure.
The principal items which would have such an effect are as follows: a under UK GAAP debt issue costs are deducted from the carrying value of the related debt instrument.
US GAAP requires such costs to be included as an asset b under UK GAAP customer contributions in respect of fixed assets are generally credited to a separate deferred income account.
Under US GAAP such contributions are netted off against the cost of the related fixed assets c under US GAAP, transmission and distribution costs would be included in cost of sales.
Under UK GAAP these are included as a separate line item within the income statement d under UK GAAP, the investors interest in the turnover and results of a joint venture or associate are disclosed gross.
The investors share of the interest and taxation are disclosed separately as a component of the group interest and taxation lines.
Under US GAAP, the investors interest in the net results of joint ventures and associates is disclosed as a single line in the income statement, net of interest and taxation e the group implemented EITF No.
03-11 Reporting Gains and Losses on Derivative Instruments that are Subject to FASB Statement No.
133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and Not Held for Trading Purposes EITF 03-11 on 1 January 2004.
EITF 03-11 addresses whether realised gains and losses should be shown gross or net in the income statement for contracts that are not held for trading purposes but are derivatives subject to FAS 133.
This issue led to a reduction in US GAAP reported turnover of 979.8 million 2003 660.6 million, 2002 948.6 million with an equivalent reduction in cost of goods sold as a result of the netting approach adopted for contracts within the scope of the Issue.
Under UK GAAP these items would be shown on a gross basis within the turnover and cost of sales line of the income statement f items included as exceptional items under UK GAAP were either classified as extraordinary items or operating items under US GAAP.
However, following the implementation of Financial Accounting Standard No.
145 Rescission of FASB Statements No.
4, 44 and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No.
13 and Technical Corrections FAS 145, on 1 April 2003 the classification of extraordinary items within the income statement under US GAAP has now been further restricted.
Accordingly the costs of early debt repayments recorded as an extraordinary item in the year ended 31 March 2002 are no longer classified as an extraordinary item.
This statement had no further impact on the groups results and financial position under US GAAP.
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income loss Under US GAAP, certain items shown as components of common equity must be more prominently reported in a separate statement as components of comprehensive income loss.
The statement of total recognised gains and losses, which is the equivalent UK GAAP primary statement, is set out on page 92.
Consolidated statement of cash flows The consolidated statement of cash flows prepared in accordance with FRS 1 Revised presents substantially the same information as that required under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, however, there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classification of items within the cash flow statement and with regard to the definition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash flows are presented separately for operating activities, dividends received from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, acquisitions and disposals, equity dividends paid, management of liquid resources, and financing.
Under US GAAP, only three categories of cash flow activity are reported: operating activities, investing activities and financing activities.
Cash flows from dividends received from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance and taxation would be included as operating activities under US GAAP.
Equity dividends paid would be included under financing activities under US GAAP.
Under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents are not offset by bank overdrafts repayable within 24 hours from the date of the advance, as is the case under UK GAAP and instead such bank overdrafts are classified within financing activities.
The consolidated cash flow statement prepared in conformity with UK GAAP is set out on page 93.
In this statement an additional measure, free cash flow, is included which is not an accepted measure under US GAAP.
This measure represents cash flow from operations after adjusting for dividends received from joint ventures, returns on investments and servicing of finance and taxation.
UK investors regard free cash flow as the money available to management annually to be allocated among a number of options including capital expenditure, payments of dividends and the financing of acquisitions.
The consolidated statement of cash flows under US GAAP is set out below: 2003 2002 2004 As restated Note 17 Note m m m Cash inflow from operating activities 1,364.0 1,412.9 1,248.4 Dividends received from joint ventures 0.5 0.9 0.3 Returns on investments and servicing of finance 210.0 297.0 377.8 Taxation 121.8 191.3 85.0 Net cash provided by operating activities 1,032.7 925.5 785.9 Capital expenditure and financial investment 831.2 675.1 1,142.5 Acquisitions and disposals 31.3 1,792.8 98.7 Net cash used provided in investing activities 862.5 1,117.7 1,043.8 Financing i 923.4 1,214.3 923.3 Movement in bank overdrafts 1.5 4.9 17.8 Equity dividends paid 394.4 523.4 496.8 Net cash provided required by financing activities 530.5 1,742.6 408.7 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 700.7 300.6 150.8 Exchange movement on cash and cash equivalents 18.0 16.8 0.2 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of financial year 664.6 380.8 230.2 Cash and cash equivalents at end of financial year 1,347.3 664.6 380.8 All liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition are considered to be cash equivalents.

ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 135 Accounts 2003 04 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2004 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued Additional information required under US GAAP a Infrastructure accounting The groups accounting policy in respect of Southern Waters infrastructure assets and related maintenance and renewals expenditure, prior to the disposal of Southern Water, was not generally accepted under US GAAP which required historical cost depreciation accounting for these assets.
The difference between the infrastructure renewals depreciation charge and depreciation accounting under US GAAP was not material to profit and equity shareholders funds.
This difference no longer exists following the disposal of Southern Water in April 2002. b Doubtful debts The group estimates its provision for doubtful debts relating to trade debtors by a combination of two methods.
Specific amounts are evaluated where information is available that a customer may be unable to meet its financial obligations.
In these circumstances, assessment is made based on available information to record a specific provision against the amount receivable from that customer to adjust the carrying value of the debtor to the amount expected to be collected.
In addition, a provision for doubtful debts within the portfolio of other debtors is made using historical experience and ageing analysis to estimate the provision required to reduce the carrying value of trade debtors to their estimated recoverable amounts.
This process involves the use of assumptions and estimates which may differ from actual experience.
The group provided 26.8 million, 36.8 million and 57.5 million for doubtful debts in 2003 04, 2002 03 and 2001 02 respectively.
Write-offs against the provision for doubtful debts for uncollectable amounts were 45.6 million, 61.2 million and 36.6 million in 2003 04, 2002 03 and 2001 02 respectively.
c Deferred tax The additional components of the estimated net deferred tax liability that would be recognised under US GAAP are as follows: 2004 2003 m m Deferred tax liabilities: Excess of book value over taxation value of fixed assets 152.0 83.6 Other temporary differences 139.5 99.3 291.5 182.9 Deferred tax assets: Other temporary differences 31.0 4.1 Net deferred tax liability 260.5 178.8 Analysed as follows: Current 5.6 4.1 Non-current 254.9 182.9 260.5 178.8 The deferred tax balance in respect of leveraged leases at the year end is 81.8 million 2003 101.1 million.
d Pensions At 31 March 2004, ScottishPower had six statutorily approved defined benefit pension schemes, one statutorily approved defined contribution scheme and one unapproved scheme.
Further details of the arrangements are given in Note 28.
Benefits under the UK defined benefit plans reflect each employees basic earnings, years of service and age at retirement.
Funding of the defined benefit plans is based upon actuarially determined contributions, with members paying contributions at fixed rates and the employers meeting the balance of cost as determined by the scheme actuaries.
Reconciliations of the beginning and ending balances of the projected pension benefit obligation and the funded status of these plans for the years ending 31 March 2004, 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2002 are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Change in projected benefit obligation m m m Projected benefit obligation at beginning of year 2,831.0 3,112.2 3,051.0 Service cost excluding plan participants contributions 45.0 52.6 62.2 Interest cost 154.8 168.6 182.5 ii Plan amendments 12.6 i iii Special termination benefits 2.5 0.6 Plan participants contributions 8.1 8.1 11.9 Actuarial loss 172.6 69.7 29.0 Benefits paid 179.2 191.5 209.5 iv Settlements 0.3 317.9 29.0 Exchange 105.6 68.3 0.9 Projected benefit obligation at end of year 2,926.4 2,831.0 3,112.2 i The period to commence the enhanced early retirement benefits under the Workforce Transition Retirement Program WTRP ended on 31 December 2002.
A credit adjustment of 2.5 million for prior special termination benefits was necessary to reflect the impact of those participants who did not commence their WTRP benefits by 31 December 2002 because they revoked their earlier election.
ii Ad hoc cost of living benefit increase for certain retired employees that was approved on 13 March 2002. iii The acquisition of PacifiCorp by ScottishPower triggered special termination benefits from the SERP during 2002. iv Assets and liabilities were transferred in 2004 and in 2002 to the PacifiCorp IBEW Local Union 57 Retirement Trust Fund and in 2003 in relation to the sale of Southern Water.

Under FAS 87 a minimum pension liability is then recognised.
This liability was recorded as a non-cash increase of 123.1 million 2003 148.4 million to regulatory assets and 71.6 million 2003 67.1 million to accumulated other comprehensive loss.
Accounting orders were received from the regulatory commissions in Utah, Oregon and Wyoming to classify most of this charge as a regulatory asset instead of a charge to other comprehensive income.
The group also filed for similar treatment with the regulatory commission in Washington during the year ended 31 March 2004.
This increase to regulatory assets will be adjusted in future periods as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation changes.
The value of plan assets relative to the accumulated benefit obligation at the year end were as follows: Value of Value of Accumulated Accumulated plan assets plan assets benefit obligation benefit obligation at 31 March 2004 at 31 March 2003 at 31 March 2004 at 31 March 2003 m m m m ScottishPower 1,538.9 1,310.5 1,535.2 1,438.4 Manweb 529.2 449.2 612.4 563.0 Final Salary LifePlan 16.0 12.8 12.7 11.3 PacifiCorp 398.9 430.9 595.0 672.2 The value of plan assets relative to the projected benefit obligation at the year end were as follows: Value of Value of Projected Projected plan assets plan assets benefit obligation benefit obligation at 31 March 2004 at 31 March 2003 at 31 March 2004 at 31 March 2003 m m m m ScottishPower 1,538.9 1,310.5 1,587.5 1,487.3 Manweb 529.2 449.2 641.8 591.0 Final Salary LifePlan 16.0 12.8 15.3 13.5 PacifiCorp 398.9 430.9 669.1 728.4 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 137 Accounts 2003 04 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2004 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued The components of pension benefit costs for the years ended 31 March 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 31 March 31 March 31 March 2004 2003 2002 m m m i i Service cost 48.1 55.7 62.2 ii Curtailment settlement cost 26.3 Interest cost 154.8 168.6 182.5 Expected return on plans assets 165.3 232.2 261.2 Amortisation of experience losses gains 26.3 0.1 5.8 Amortisation of prior service cost 0.2 1.1 Amortisation of transition obligation asset 0.9 0.7 0.9 Net periodic benefit cost credit 62.8 17.8 24.3 i Includes the contribution of 3.1 million 2003 3.1 million to the PacifiCorp IBEW Local Union 57 Retirement Trust Fund.

The group expects to contribute 23.3 million to the UK pension schemes and 36.9 million $67.8 million to the PacifiCorp pension scheme in the year ending 31 March 2005.
The actuarial assumptions adopted in arriving at the above figures are as follows: 31 March 31 March 31 March UK arrangements assumptions at: 2004 2003 2002 Expected return on plans assets 6.75% p. a.
Rate of earnings increase 4.3% p. a.

For the US arrangements the measurement dates for the years ended 31 March 2004, 2003 and 2002 are 31 December 2003, 2002 and 2001 respectively.
The measurement dates for the UK arrangements are as at each respective year end.
e Other post-retirement benefits PacifiCorp provides healthcare and life insurance benefits through various plans for eligible retirees.
The cost of other post-retirement benefits is accrued over the active service period of employees.
The transition obligation represents the unrecognised prior service cost and is being amortised over a period of 20 years.
PacifiCorp funds other post-retirement benefit expense through a combination of funding vehicles.
Over the period from 1 April 2003 to 31 March 2004, PacifiCorp made contributions totalling 16.5 million in respect of these arrangements.
These funds are invested in common stocks, bonds and US government obligations.
The net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost and significant assumptions are summarised as follows: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Service cost 4.4 3.6 3.6 Interest cost 20.2 22.1 20.0 Expected return on plan assets 15.7 18.5 20.4 Amortisation of experience losses 3.9 1.3 Net periodic other post-retirement benefit cost 12.8 8.5 3.2 The change in the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation, change in plan assets and funded status are as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Change in accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation m m m Accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation at beginning of year 330.4 331.3 268.0 Service cost 4.4 3.6 3.6 Interest cost 20.2 22.1 20.0 Plan participants contributions 4.0 3.9 3.8 i Special termination benefit gain 0.6 Plan amendment 0.4 Actuarial loss 12.7 26.4 53.8 Benefits paid 22.3 21.8 18.8 Exchange 47.7 34.5 0.9 Accumulated other post-retirement obligation at end of year 302.1 330.4 331.3 i The period to commence the enhanced early retirement benefits under the WTRP ended on 31 December 2002.

The measurement dates for the years ended 31 March 2004, 2003 and 2002 are 31 December 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.
The healthcare cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
"Increasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have increased the accumulated other post-retirement benefit obligation the ""APBO"" as at 31 March 2004 by 17.4 million 2003 16.4 million, 2002 18.5 million and the annual net periodic other post-retirement benefit costs by 1.5 million 2003 1.4 million, 2002 1.3 million."
Decreasing the assumed healthcare cost trend rate by one percentage point would have reduced the APBO as at 31 March 2004 by 14.7 million 2003 14.3 million, 2002 17.1 million, and the annual net periodic other post-retirement benefit costs by 1.3 million 2003 1.2 million, 2002 1.2 million.
Employee savings and stock ownership plan PacifiCorp has an employee savings and stock ownership plan that qualifies as a tax-deferred arrangement under Section 401 a, 401 k, and 401 m of the Internal Revenue Code.
Participating US employees may defer up to 25% of their compensation, subject to certain regulatory limitations.
This limit was raised to 50% in February 2004.
Employees can select a variety of investment options including ScottishPower American Depository Shares formerly PacifiCorp shares.
PacifiCorp matches 50% of employee contributions on amounts deferred up to 6% of total compensation with that portion vesting over the initial five years of an employees participation in the Plan.
Thereafter, PacifiCorp contributions vest immediately.
PacifiCorps matching contribution is allocated based on the employees investment selections.
PacifiCorps additional contribution is allocated based on the employees investment selections or to the money market fund if the employee has made no selections.
PacifiCorp makes an additional contribution equal to a percentage of the employee's eligible earnings.
These contributions are immediately vested.
Employer contributions to the savings plan were 10.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2004 2003 10.0 million, 2002 14.7 million.
f Southern Water disposal On 23 April 2002, the group completed the sale of Aspen 4 Limited the holding company of Southern Water plc to First Aqua Limited.
A summary of the net assets disposed of calculated under US GAAP are detailed in the table below: m Tangible fixed assets 2,474.7 Fixed asset investments 1.9 Current assets 193.1 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year 1,053.8 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Loans and other borrowings 100.0 Provisions for liabilities and charges 366.6 Deferred income 37.4 Net assets 1,111.9 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 139 Accounts 2003 04 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2004 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued g Asset retirement obligations and accrued environmental costs i Asset retirement obligations In June 2001, the FASB issued FAS 143 'Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations' FAS 143 which became effective for the group on 1 April 2003.
The group recorded asset retirement obligations for generation plants, landfills and coal mines which qualified as legal obligations under FAS 143.
Under the requirements of the statement the group estimates its asset retirement obligations liabilities based upon detailed engineering calculations of the amount and timing of the future cash spending for a third party to perform the required work.
Spending estimates are escalated for inflation and then discounted at the appropriate rate.
The group then records an asset retirement obligations asset associated with the liability.
The asset is depreciated over its expected life and the liability is accreted to the projected spending date.
Changes in estimates could occur due to plan revisions, changes in estimated costs and changes in timing of the performance of reclamation activities.
In addition, under US regulatory accounting requirements the group records removal costs as part of depreciation expense.
Therefore, as a consequence of adopting FAS 143, the net difference between the previously recorded amounts that qualify as asset retirement obligations for regulatory purposes and the fair value amounts determined under FAS 143 have been recognised as a non-cash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle.
The cumulative adjustment to US GAAP profits was 0.6 million net of tax.
Similarly, the groups US business recovers asset retirement costs through the rate making process and records a regulatory asset or liability on the balance sheet to account for the difference between asset retirement costs as currently approved in rates and costs under FAS 143.
As at 31 March 2004 a regulatory asset of 2.1 million had been recorded for this purpose.
The following table details the movements on the groups asset retirement obligation liability for the year ended 31 March 2004: m Asset retirement obligation recognised at adoption on 1 April 2003 132.3 New liabilities 11.4 Obligations utilised 10.8 Accretion expense 5.4 Exchange 17.1 Asset retirement obligation as at 31 March 2004 121.2 The current portion of the asset retirement obligation as at 31 March 2004 was 7.5 million.
The pro forma asset retirement obligation liability balances that would have been reported assuming FAS 143 had been adopted on 1 April 2001 rather than 1 April 2003 are as follows: m Pro forma asset retirement obligation liability as at 1 April 2001 152.3 Pro forma asset retirement obligation liability as at 31 March 2002 148.1 The adoption of FAS 143 would have had no material impact on US GAAP net income or reported cash flows for the pro forma periods listed above.
The group had trust fund assets of 47.6 million at 31 March 2004 2003 43.3 million, relating to mine reclamation, including joint owners portions.
ii Accrued environmental costs Estimates of environmental liabilities are principally based on reports prepared by external consultants.
The ultimate cost of environmental disturbance is uncertain and there may be variances from these cost estimates, which could affect future results.
Environmental liabilities are generally recorded on an undiscounted basis.
These liabilities are recorded in the UK GAAP balance sheet within Provisions for liabilities and charges other provisions and the US GAAP liability as at 31 March 2004 was 20.3 million 2003 35.7 million.
h Leveraged leases The pre-tax income loss from leveraged leases during the year was 2.9 million 2003 27.8 million, the tax charge credit on the pre-tax income loss was 0.9 million 2003 10.7 million and the investment tax credit recognised in the income statement was 0.8 million 2003 0.9 million.
i Commitments and contingencies i Environmental issues UK businesses The groups UK businesses are subject to numerous regulatory requirements with respect to the protection of the environment, including environmental laws which regulate the construction, operation and decommissioning of power stations, pursuant to legislation implementing environmental directives adopted by the EU and protocols agreed under the auspices of international bodies such as the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.
The group believes that it has taken and continues to take measures to comply with applicable laws and regulations for the protection of the environment.
Applicable regulations and requirements pertaining to the environment change frequently, however, with the result that continued compliance may require material investments, or that the groups costs and results of operation are less favourable than anticipated.
PacifiCorp PacifiCorp is subject to numerous environmental laws including: the Federal Clean Air Act, as enforced by the Environmental Protection Agency and various state agencies: the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments: the Endangered Species Act of 1973, particularly as it relates to certain potentially endangered species of fish: the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, relating to environmental cleanups: along with the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 and Clean Water Act relating to water quality.
These laws could potentially impact future operations.
For those contingencies identified at 31 March 2004, principally Clean Air matters, which are the subject of discussions with the United States Environmental Protection Agency and state regulatory authorities, future costs relating to these matters may be significant and consist primarily of capital expenditures.
However, PacifiCorp expects these costs will be included within rates and, therefore, are not expected to have a material impact on the groups results and financial position.
ii Hydroelectric relicensing PacifiCorp Approximately 97% of the installed capacity of PacifiCorps hydroelectric portfolio is regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission through 20 individual licences.
Nearly all of PacifiCorps hydroelectric projects are at some stage of relicensing under the Federal Power Act.
Hydroelectric relicensing and the related environmental compliance requirements are subject to uncertainties.
PacifiCorp expects that future costs relating to these matters may be significant and consist primarily of additional relicensing costs, operations and maintenance expense and capital expenditures.
PacifiCorp expects future costs relating to these matters may be significant and consist primarily of additional environmental requirements.
The group has accumulated approximately 7.6 million in costs for ongoing hydroelectric relicensing and it is expected that these and other future costs will be included in rates, and as such, will not have a material adverse impact on the groups results and financial position under US GAAP.
j Mine reclamation PacifiCorp All of PacifiCorps mining operations are subject to reclamation and closure requirements.
Compliance with these requirements could result in higher expenditures for both capital improvements and operating costs.
140 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued k Deferred net power costs PacifiCorp At 31 March 2004, PacifiCorp had deferred net power costs for the states of Utah, Oregon and Idaho.
While PacifiCorp is pursuing full recovery of these costs, there can be no assurance that this will be achieved.
Denial of recovery would result in the write-off of 31.4 million of deferred net power costs net of amortisation, under US GAAP, reported under US regulatory assets in the UK US GAAP reconciliation of equity shareholders funds.
l Regulation PacifiCorp The Emerging Issues Task Force EITF of the FASB concluded in 1997 that FAS 71 should be discontinued when detailed legislation or regulatory orders regarding competition are issued.
Additionally, the EITF concluded that regulatory assets and liabilities applicable to businesses being deregulated should be written-off unless their recovery is provided through future regulated cash flows.
PacifiCorp continuously evaluates the appropriateness of applying FAS 71 to each of its jurisdictions.
At 31 March 2004, the group concluded that FAS 71 was appropriate.
However, if efforts to deregulate progress, the group may in the future be required to discontinue its application of FAS 71 to all or a portion of its business.
Based on the groups US regulatory net asset balance under US GAAP at 31 March 2004, if the group stopped applying FAS 71 to its remaining regulated US operations, it would have recorded an after tax loss of 445.0 million under US GAAP.
m Guarantees In accordance with FASB Interpretation No.
45 FIN 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others: an Interpretation of FASB Statements No.
5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No.
34, the group is required to disclose certain guarantees as defined in FIN 45.
These guarantees principally relate to the groups disposal of its former operations and are typical of these types of transactions.
Furthermore, disclosure is required under FIN 45 of guarantees even where the likelihood that a liability will crystallise is remote.
FIN 45 also requires recognition of liabilities under US GAAP of the fair value of certain guarantees issued or modified after 31 December 2002.
No such guarantees have been identified.
The disclosures required to be made under FIN 45 are detailed below: The group has entered into a number of transactions involving the sale of parts of its business and the purchase of certain businesses and assets in accordance with overall group strategy.
These transactions include the disposal of Southern Water, the demerger of Thus plc, the sale and disposal of the groups Appliance Retailing business and the disposal of other non-core activities.
It is standard practice in such transactions to obtain or grant contractual assurances, including in the form of warranties and indemnities.
In conducting merger, disposal or acquisition transactions the group takes significant steps to quantify and mitigate risk at the outset of any transaction and as the transaction progresses.
Steps include carrying out, or granting the facility for the conduct of, a thorough due diligence exercise to ascertain any likely liabilities and, where the group is the vendor, the use of caps and threshold levels for liability, inserting time limits on claim periods and detailed disclosure.
Under certain of the business disposals, indemnities under the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 1981 the Regulations are still outstanding.
These indemnities relate to potential liabilities with respect to former employees of the group in relation to their period of employment in the group.
Typically there is no maximum limit on claims under these indemnities.
Recourse via tax warranties and indemnities remains outstanding on the same basis as stated above and in relation to the disposal of ScottishPower Telecommunications Services Limited, a former subsidiary of Thus plc.
The maximum financial exposure under these arrangements is 7.5 million.
No claims have been intimated in relation to this arrangement and the directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under this arrangement.
On 23 April 2002, the group sold Aspen 4 Limited, the owner of the Southern Water group of companies.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give assurances, in the form of warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
In relation to this transaction the warranty liability period commenced on 23 April 2002 and ends on 23 April 2007 for environmental warranties and on 23 April 2009 for tax warranties.
The warranty liability period for all other warranties expired on 23 April 2004.
The sale and purchase agreement contains a number of limitations to and exclusions of liability and maximum financial exposure for breach of the warranties apart from tax warranties is capped at 900.0 million.
For the tax warranties the maximum exposure is approximately 1,950.0 million.
There are also minimum threshold claim levels to be reached before a potential claim arises at all and thereafter as to whether it can be made.
The directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements as a detailed due diligence exercise was carried out pre-disposal and detailed disclosures were made to the purchaser so as to make them aware of all relevant information concerning the business and, consequentially, to reduce the likelihood of claims being made against the group.
On 8 October 2001, certain business and assets of the groups former Appliance Retailing business were sold and the remainder of the business was closed.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give assurances in the form of certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
In relation to this transaction the warranty liability period commenced on 8 October 2001 and ended on 8 October 2003 with the exception of taxation and pensions warranties which end on October 2007.
Protection relating to the sale of the groups former subsidiary, Domestic Appliance Insurance Limited DAIL was given in relation to any shortfall in the provisions for claims for which DAIL was liable, if any, under the Cashback warranty scheme.
The stated limit for all warranty claims was 75.0 million.
Although a potential claim was received prior to the deadline with respect to the adequacy of the cashback provisions in the DAIL accounts and discussions have taken place with respect to such a claim the directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements.
Under the transaction a number of properties were also assigned to the purchaser.
The purchaser became insolvent in August 2003.
By operation of law and through the putting in place of standard agreements at the time of the sale, the liability for rent and certain other items due under some of these lease arrangements have reverted to the group.
The maximum liability to the group for rental payments in the event of insolvency of the purchaser was estimated at approximately 9.0 million per annum.
Steps have been and are still being taken to mitigate the liability that arises from this, including surrendering leases to landlords and putting in place new tenants to take over the liability.
It is thus extremely unlikely that the group will ultimately become liable to this extent.
On 3 August 2000, the group agreed to sell Powercor Australia Ltd.
In such transactions it is standard practice for the vendor to give certain warranties and indemnities to the purchaser.
The group agreed to indemnify the purchaser for any breaches of representations relating to tax warranties or tax claims as defined therein until August 2005.
The indemnity is limited by a AUD$15.0 million 6.2 million basket, with the group liable for the excess over this amount only and an overall cap of AUD$300.0 million 124.6 million.
No claims have been intimated in relation to the above noted arrangements and the directors consider it extremely unlikely that there will be any material financial exposure to the group under these arrangements.
To the extent that claims based upon the arrangements below are limited by applicable statutes, the limitation periods generally vary from three to six years, depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the claim.
In connection with the sale of PacifiCorp's Montana service territory, PacifiCorp entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Flathead Electric Cooperative Flathead dated 9 October 1998.
Under the agreement, PacifiCorp indemnified Flathead for losses, if any, occurring after the closing date and arising as a result of certain breaches of warranty or covenants.
The indemnification has a cap of $10.1 million 5.5 million until October 2008 and a cap of $5.1 million 2.8 million thereafter less expended costs to date.
Two indemnity claims relating to environmental issues have been tendered, but remediation costs for this claim, if any, are not expected to create a material financial exposure for the group.
ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 141 Accounts 2003 04 Notes to the Group Accounts continued for the year ended 31 March 2004 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued On 15 October 2001, the group sold its synthetic fuels operation.
The group agreed to indemnify the purchaser from losses suffered as a result of fraud or breach of representation or warranty, within 30 days of the expiration of the applicable statutory period of limitations.
The established basket and cap do not apply to the surviving representations and warranties.
The group also agreed to indemnify the purchaser for tax liabilities up to the closing date: this indemnity also expires within 30 days of the expiration of the statutory period of limitations.
On 9 February 1999, PacifiCorp Group Holdings Company agreed to sell TPC Corporation.
The group provided indemnification to the purchaser for breaches of representations and warranties relating to environmental matters, tax matters and employee benefits for a limited period with regard to the environmental matters which ended on 9 February 2004, and through the applicable statute of limitations on tax and employee benefit matters.
The indemnification is limited to a $1.0 million 0.5 million basket, with the group liable for the excess over this amount only and an overall $10.0 million 5.4 million cap.
In addition, certain special indemnities were provided with respect to certain specified matters.
PacifiCorp and its subsidiaries have made certain commitments related to the decommissioning or reclamation of certain jointly-owned facilities and mine sites.
The decommissioning guarantees require such companies to pay a proportionate share of the decommissioning costs based upon percentage of ownership.
The mine reclamation obligations require such companies to pay the mining entity a proportionate share of the mines reclamation costs based on the amount of coal purchased by PacifiCorp and its subsidiaries.
In the event of default by any of the other joint participants, such companies are potentially obliged to absorb, directly or by paying additional sums to the project entity, a share, or all, of the defaulting partys liability.
The group has recorded its estimated share of the decommissioning and reclamation obligations.
ScottishPower Energy Retail Limited SPERL has entered into an agreement with Lloyds TSB in relation to energy marketing and services.
This agreement contains indemnities in relation to transfer of staff by operation of the Regulations from SPERL to Lloyds TSB.
The maximum liability is limited to 5.0 million.
No claims have been intimated.
Under certain cash collateral agreements, Automated Power Exchange UK Limited, UK Power Exchange and Elexon can draw down and use cash collateral in event of default situations including upon a change in credit rating.
The maximum financial exposure under these arrangements is 13.4 million.
Under the groups arrangements carried out in accordance with the standard terms and conditions of the International Swap Dealers Association, Inc. ISDA Master Agreement there is a provision that the group will indemnify the counter-party for certain withholding taxes incurred under relevant tax laws.
A liability under this indemnification will only arise on the occurrence of certain changes to tax laws in the jurisdiction of a relevant counterparty.
The directors are not aware of any such contemplated changes.
n Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities The group uses derivative instruments in the normal course of business, to offset fluctuations in earnings, cash flows and equity associated with movements in exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
FAS 133 Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 138, was adopted by the group with effect from 1 April 2001.
In April 2003, the FASB issued FAS No.
149 Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, FAS 149.
This statement amends and clarifies financial reporting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities.
This statement was effective for contracts entered into or modified after 30 June 2003.
In applying this statement, the group began marking-to-market certain transactions that were entered into after 30 June 2003 that, prior to the implementation of FAS 149, would have qualified for the normal purchase and normal sales exemption under FAS 133.
FAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives and for hedging activities.
FAS 133 requires that an entity recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet and measure those instruments at fair value.
FAS 133 prescribes requirements for designation and documentation of hedging relationships and ongoing assessments of effectiveness in order to qualify for hedge accounting.
Hedge effectiveness is assessed consistently with the method and risk management strategy documented for each hedging relationship.
On at least a quarterly basis, the group assesses the effectiveness of each hedging relationship retrospectively and prospectively to ensure that hedge accounting was appropriate for the prior period and continues to be appropriate for future periods.
The group applies the short cut method of assessing effectiveness when possible.
The group considers hedge accounting to be appropriate if the assessment of hedge effectiveness indicates that the change in fair value of the designated hedging instrument is 80% to 125% effective at offsetting the change in fair value arising on the hedged risk of the hedged item or transaction.
The effect of changes in fair value of certain derivative instruments entered into to hedge PacifiCorps future retail resource requirements are subject to regulation in the US and therefore are deferred pursuant to FAS 71.
PacifiCorp requested and received deferred accounting orders for the effects of FAS 133 as it relates to the change in value of certain long-term wholesale electricity contracts not meeting the definition of normal purchases and normal sales contracts.
Categories of derivatives Derivatives are classified into four categories: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges, overseas net investment hedges and trading.
If a derivative instrument qualifies as a fair value hedge the change in the fair value of the derivative and the change in the fair value of hedged risk arising on the hedged item is recorded in earnings.
The corresponding change is recorded against the book values of the derivative and hedged item on the balance sheet.
If a derivative instrument qualifies as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the hedging instruments gain or loss is reported in shareholders funds under US GAAP as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognised in earnings in the period during which the transaction being hedged affects earnings.
The ineffective portion of the derivatives fair value change is recorded in earnings.
For derivative instruments designated as a hedge of the foreign currency risk in an overseas net investment, gains or losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates are recorded in the cumulative translation adjustment within shareholders funds under US GAAP as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.
If a derivative instrument does not qualify as either a net investment hedge or a cash flow hedge under the applicable guidance, the change in the fair value of the derivative is immediately recognised in earnings or as an adjustment to the FAS 71 regulatory asset as appropriate.
Derivative instruments are not generally held by the company for speculative trading purposes.
To the extent such instruments are held they are measured at fair value with gains or losses recorded in earnings.
The net fair value of trading derivatives at 31 March 2004 was 0.6 million.
142 ScottishPower Annual Report and Accounts 2003 04 34 Summary of differences between UK and US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles GAAP continued Certain contracts that meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133 may qualify as a normal purchase or a normal sale and be excluded from the scope of FAS 133.
Specific criteria must be met in order for a contract that would otherwise be regarded as a derivative to qualify as a normal purchase or a normal sale.
The group has evaluated all commodity contracts to determine if they meet the definition of a derivative and qualify as a normal purchase or a normal sale.
The group also evaluates contracts for embedded derivatives, and considers whether any embedded derivatives have to be separated from the underlying host contract and accounted for separately in accordance with FAS 133 requirements.
Where embedded derivatives have terms that are not clearly and closely related to the terms of the host contract in which they are included, they are accounted for separately from the host contract as derivatives, with changes in the fair value recorded in earnings, to the extent that the hybrid instrument is not already accounted for at fair value.
Discontinued hedge accounting When hedge accounting is discontinued due to the groups determination that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge, the group will continue to carry the derivative on the balance sheet at its fair value.
The related hedged asset or liability will cease to be adjusted for changes in fair value relating to the previously hedged risk.
When the group discontinues hedge accounting in a cash flow hedge because it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur in the expected period, the gain or loss on the derivative remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings.
However, if it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two-month period of time thereafter, the gains and losses that were accumulated in other comprehensive income will be recognised in earnings.
Where a derivative instrument ceases to meet the criteria for hedge accounting, any subsequent gains and losses are recognised in earnings.
Fair value hedges The group seeks to maintain a desired level of floating rate debt, and uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to manage interest rate and foreign currency risk arising from long-term debt obligations denominated in sterling and foreign currencies.
The group does not exclude any component of derivative gains and losses from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
The ineffective portion of fair value hedges as at 31 March 2004 resulted in a loss of 0.7 million recorded for the year ended 31 March 2004.
Cash flow hedges A desired level of fixed rate debt is maintained through the use of interest rate and cross-currency swaps.
Foreign currency forward contracts are used to fix the exchange rate on future contracted purchases of assets.
These transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
The group does not exclude any component of derivative gains and losses from the assessment of ineffectiveness.
The amount of ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges recorded for the year ended 31 March 2004 was nil.
Net realised losses on cash flow hedges totalling 2.5 million were transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income into income during the year to match the underlying hedged items recognised in the income statement.
The group estimates that losses of 6.3 million on cash flow hedges in place at the year end will be transferred from accumulated other comprehensive income into income during 2004 05.
Net investment hedges The group uses foreign currency forwards and cross-currency swaps to protect the value of its investments in operations denominated in foreign currencies.
The group excludes the spot-forward difference from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
In the year ended 31 March 2004 the group recorded a 295.9 million translation adjustment gain related to net investment hedges.
o Recent US accounting pronouncements In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No.
46, Consolidation of Variable-Interest Entities, an interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No.
51 FIN 46, which was subsequently revised and became effective for the group on 1 April 2004.
FIN 46 requires existing unconsolidated variable-interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved.
The group has considered the application of this standard to its operations and has completed an assessment of the impact of this standard.
Following this review the group identified one variable interest entity which would be required to be consolidated and the necessary disclosures are given below.
PacifiCorp holds an undivided interest in 50.0% of the 474 MW Hermiston plant, procures 100.0% of the fuel input into the plant and subsequently acquires 100.0% of the generated electricity.
Since PacifiCorp owns only 50.0% of the plant, it is required to purchase 50.0% of the generated electricity from the joint owner in which PacifiCorp holds no equity interest through a long-term purchase power agreement.
As a result, PacifiCorp holds a variable-interest in the joint owner of theremaining 50.0% of the plant and is the primary beneficiary.
However, PacifiCorp was unable to obtain the information necessary to consolidate the entity as the entity did not agree to supply the information due to the lack of a contractual obligation to do so.
Electricity purchased from the joint owner for the year ended 31 March 2004 was 19.9 million 2003 22.0 million, 2002 23.1 million.
The entity is operated by the equity owners and PacifiCorp has no risk of loss in relation to the entity in the event of a disaster.
In January and May 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No.
106-1 and FASB Staff Positon No.
106-2 Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 FASB SP No.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Medicare Act was signed into law in December 2003 and establishes a prescription drug benefit, as well as a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a prescription drug benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicares prescription drug coverage.
106-2 provides guidance on the accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act for employers that sponsor post-retirement healthcare plans that provide prescription drug benefits and requires those employers to provide certain disclosures regarding the effect of the federal subsidy provided by the Medicare Act.
106-1, the group elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Medicare Act.
This deferral remains in effect until the appropriate effective date of FASB SP No.
For entities that elected deferral and for which the impact is significant, FASB SP No.
106-2 is effective for the first interim or annual period beginning after 15 June 2004.
For entities that will not recognise a significant impact, delayed recognition of the effects of the Medicare Act until the next regularly scheduled measurement date following issuance of FASB SP No.
The group is still evaluating the impact of the Medicare Act.
Accordingly, the groups Accounts do not reflect the effects that may result from the Medicare Act.
