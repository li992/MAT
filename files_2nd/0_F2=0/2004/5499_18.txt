Enodis et al.
In the case, the bankruptcy trustee sought to hold Enodis Corporation liable as the alter ego of its former subsidiary, Consolidated Industries Corporation Consolidated, for the debts and other liabilities of Consolidated.
Enodis Corporation sold Consolidated to an unrelated party in 1998.
Shortly after the sale, Consolidated commenced bankruptcy proceedings.
In addition to the alter ego claim, the trustee asserted a variety of bankruptcy and equitable claims seeking to recover up to $37m paid by Consolidated to Enodis Group between 1988 and 1998.
On 28 July 2004, the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Indiana issued an opinion dismissing all claims against all defendants other than Enodis Corporation, and held that the trustee was not entitled to assert the alter ego claims against Enodis Corporation.
However, the Court also held that the Trustee was entitled to recover $30m paid by Consolidated, plus prejudgement interest, for a total of approximately $43m.
This judgement is in addition to the summary judgement issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana previously discussed in our 2003 Annual Report in the amount of approximately $8.6m.
Enodis Group has appealed the adverse portion of the decision of the Bankruptcy Court and will appeal the previous adverse decision of the District Court when it is appropriate to do so.
The Directors, having considered advice from external legal counsel, believe the adverse portion of the decision of the Bankruptcy Court and the decision of the District Court to be in error, and based on said advice further believe it is probable that Enodis appeals will be successful.
As a result of the decision to appeal, the Group has reassessed its accruals for legal costs for defending the claims and has provided a further 3.2m 2003: 3.1m.
The Groups view of the outcome of the Consolidated Industries litigation remains unchanged see note 24.
2003 On 8 April 2003, the Group announced a restructuring and cost reduction programme including salaried headcount reduction and the relocation of the CEOs office to Tampa, Florida.
Subsequently, further restructuring programmes were announced in Europe.
46 Enodis annual report accounts 2004 Notes to the accounts 4 Exceptional items continued In addition, as a result of a slowdown in the property market, 3.3m was recognised in respect of vacant leasehold properties.
In FY04 an increase in vacant leasehold provisions of 0.9m has been charged to pre-exceptional operating profit see note 19.
Following the adverse summary judgement on certain of the claims totalling $8.6m referred to above, the Group provided 3.1m in respect of additional legal costs to be incurred in defending the claims.

As a result, excess provisions of 0.9m and 1.3m have been credited to the profit and loss account.
2003 In February 2003, the Group paid 1.3m to release it from the majority of the warranties and indemnities that were given at the time of the disposal of one of its subsidiaries.
As a result, excess accruals of 2.5m, along with 0.8m from other disposals, were credited to the profit and loss account.

On 17 September 2004, the Group entered into a new five year unsecured revolving credit agreement The Facility replacing the existing senior secured credit facility.
The new Facility comprises a $225.0m multi-currency revolving credit facility provided by a small syndicate of banks.
Drawings under the Facility bear interest at between 0.75% and 1.50% above LIBOR as periodically determined by reference to certain agreed financial ratios.
Current drawings bear interest at LIBOR 0.95%.
Most of our significant subsidiaries are guarantors under the Facility and have unconditionally guaranteed all of the outstanding obligations under the Facility Agreement.
3 The 100.0m senior subordinated notes bear interest at 10 8% and mature in April 2012.
The Group has entered into cross-currency swaps to change part of the underlying currency profile of this debt.
Two contracts have been entered into to exchange an aggregate of 60.0m for US dollars and Euros, such that the currency profile of the debt more closely matches the currency profile of the Groups assets.
The Group may from time to time use interest rate swap or forward rate agreements to change a portion of its debt between fixed and floating rates, to manage the impact of changes in interest rates on the Groups interest charge.
At 2 October 2004, the Group had no interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements outstanding.
Other loans consist primarily of 9.3m of Industrial Revenue Bonds IRB 2003: 10.0m off-set by a favourable revaluation of cross-currency swaps used to hedge debt of 4.2m 2003: 1.8m.
The IRB are either at fixed rates of interest or are at rates of interest set periodically by reference to market rates.
These bonds incurred rates of interest between 1.8% and 6.1% during the period.

The fair value of the senior subordinated notes is the closing mid-price on the close of business on the balance sheet date.
The fair value of short-term deposits and borrowings approximates the carrying amount because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.
The fair value of the long-term borrowings approximates the carrying value due to the debt being subject to floating rates or short-term fixed rates.
e Hedging As explained in the Financial review on pages 18 to 22, the Groups policy is to hedge the following exposures: Interest rate risk using interest rate swaps, caps and collars and forward rate agreements.
Balance sheet translation risk using cross currency swaps and borrowings in functional currencies.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is likely to be recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are as follows: Gains Losses 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Forward foreign currency contracts 1.8 0.1 2.6 f Currency profileThe main functional currencies of the Group are Sterling and US$.
The following analysis of net monetary assets and liabilities shows the Groups currency exposures after the effects of forward contracts used to manage currency exposure.
The amounts shown represent the transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating units involved.

The defined benefit scheme in the UK is the Berisford 1948 Pension Scheme the Berisford Scheme.
A valuation was carried out by a qualified independent actuary at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit method.
Following the valuation it was agreed that the employer would pay contributions at the rate of 30% of pensionable salaries.
The main financial assumptions used in the valuation are set out below: Investment returns 5.5% p. a.
Present and future pensions 5.0% p. a.
The total market value of the Berisford Schemes assets at the last valuation date was 77.7m.
The funding level after allowing for future increases in earnings, and using a market value of assets, was 99%.
b Enodis Corporation maintains a 401 k plan which covers most of its employees.
This is a defined contribution arrangement.
c Scotsman Industries maintains a pension plan which covers certain of its employees with frozen accrued benefits.
Benefits under defined benefit plans for hourly paid employees are based on a fixed multiple of the length of service and for salaried employees are based on a percentage of earnings during the period of their employment.
All pension plans have been funded in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.
The last valuation of the main defined benefit plan was as at 1 January 2004.
No employer contributions are currently being paid to this plan.
The following main assumptions were used to develop net pension costs for pension plans in the USA in the 53 weeks ended 2 October 2004: Discount rate 5.8% p. a.

In the case, the bankruptcy trustee sought to hold Enodis Corporation liable as the alter ego of its former subsidiary Consolidated Industries Corporation Consolidated, for the debts and other liabilities of Consolidated.
As previously discussed in our 2003 Annual Report, on 7 January 2003, the Indiana District Court entered a partial summary judgement for $8.6m against Enodis Corporation in relation to the complaint by the Trustee that the purchase price paid to Enodis for the share capital of Consolidated was a fraudulent transfer under US bankruptcy law.
On 28 July 2004, the Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion dismissing all claims against all defendants other than Enodis Corporation, and held that the trustee was not entitled to assert the alter ego claims against Enodis Corporation.
However, the Court also held that the trustee was entitled to recover $30m paid by Consolidated, plus prejudgement interest, for a total of approximately $43m.
This judgement is in addition to the summary judgement issued by the United States District Court in 2003.
The Group also involved in other Consolidated lawsuits involving $3.25m of specified claims as well as other claims for unspecified damages.
These claims are currently pending and we continue to defend them vigorously.
Other parties in cases pending against Consolidated have threatened to sue Enodis Corporation as Consolidated's alter ego.
Currently, however, no party other than the Trustee is actively pursuing this theory against Enodis Corporation.
