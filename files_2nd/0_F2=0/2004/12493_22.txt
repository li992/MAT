NOTE 31 CONTINUED Under UK GAAP, costs relating to the preference share conversion are charged against share premium: whereas, under US GAAP, such costs are charged in arriving at net income.
Under UK GAAP, the cost of repurchasing preference shares is treated as a movement in the profit and loss reserve.
On cancellation of the shares a non-distributable reserve is created equivalent to the nominal value of the shares cancelled.
Under US GAAP, as the cumulative convertible redeemable preference shares are considered to closely resemble debt, the transaction is considered to be an early extinguishment of debt and the difference between the cost of repurchasing the shares and the book value of the debt is recorded as a gain.
Ordinary Dividends Under UK GAAP, provision is made for dividends in the year in respect of which they are proposed by the Directors: whereas, under US GAAP, provision for dividends is not made until they are formally declared by the Directors.
