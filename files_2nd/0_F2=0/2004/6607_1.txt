The results of the Group, as reported in sterling, are therefore affected by movements in exchange rates between sterling and overseas currencies.
Average exchange rates prevailing during the period are used to translate the results and cash ows of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings and joint ventures into sterling.
Period end rates are used to translate the net assets of those undertakings.
The currencies which most inuence these translations are the US dollar, the Euro and the Japanese Yen.
In order to illustrate underlying performance, it is the Groups practice to discuss its results in terms of constant exchange rate CER growth.
This represents growth calculated as if the exchange rates used to determine the results of overseas companies in sterling had remained unchanged from those used in the previous year.
CER% represents growth at constant exchange rates.
% represents growth at actual exchange rates.
During the years 2000 to 2003, business performance was the primary performance measure used by management and was presented after excluding merger items, integration and restructuring costs and disposals of businesses.
Management believes that exclusion of these items provides a better comparison of the way in which the business was managed and gives an indication of the performance of the Group in terms of those elements of revenue and expenditure which local management was able to inuence.
For 2004, with the completion of these programmes, the Group is reporting results on a statutory basis only.
Growth rates are presented comparing 2004 results both with 2003 business performance results and 2003 statutory results.
Management considers that the comparison of 2004 statutory results with 2003 business performance results gives the most appropriate indication of the Groups performance for the period under review and therefore commentaries are presented on this basis unless otherwise stated.
