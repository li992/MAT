Pensions The Group operates two funded schemes, which provide benets based on the final pensionable pay of participating employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group, being invested with independent fund managers.
Contributions are charged to the consolidated profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The charges are determined by a qualied actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method.
The most recent valuations of the schemes were at 6 April 2002.
The valuation of the MFI Group Pension Plan, the principal scheme at that date, showed that the scheme had a market value of assets of 253m at that time and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 95% of the benets that had accrued to the members, after allowing for agreed changes to members benets and for future expected increases in earnings.
This deficit will have increased by 25 December 2004, as a result of movements in investment markets in the last three years, changes in actuarial assumptions and the additional obligations relating to the normal retirement date issue NRD issue identied in May 2004.
The principal actuarial assumptions used are an investment return of 6.75% per annum, rates of salary increase of 3.75% per annum and rates of 2.5% per annum for pensions in payment in excess of the Guaranteed Minimum Pension accrued pre and post 6 April 1988 respectively.
The total pension charge for the period was 16.0m 2003 12.5m.
The increase of 3.5m relates to the charge in relation to the additional NRD issue liability.
Additional disclosures regarding the Groups dened benefit pension schemes are required under the transitional provisions of FRS17 Retirement benets and these are set out below.
The disclosures relate to the second year of the transitional provisions.

Pensions continued The actuarial valuation of the schemes as at 6 April 2002 was updated to 31 December 2004 by an independent qualied actuary on a basis consistent with the requirements of FRS 17 and is reported below.
It showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 316m and that the actuarial value of these assets represented 52% of the benets that had accrued to members.
The weighted average major assumptions used for this update were: 31 Dec 2004 31 Dec 2003 31 Dec 2002 Rate of increase in salaries 3.9% 3.0% 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment pre 6 April 1997 3.0% 3.0% 3.0% Rate of increase in pensions in payment post 6 April 1997 2.9% 2.5% 2.0% Discount rate 5.4% 5.5% 5.5% Ination assumption 2.9% 2.5% 2.0% As the NRD issue liability relates to additional pensions obligations arising from the failure in 1994 to properly equalise the pension age for men and women, we have restated the 2002 and 2003 comparative disclosures to reect the additional NRD issue liability.
The 2002 and 2003 pre-tax deficits have increased by 34m and 44m respectively.

Should the assignees fail to full any obligations in respect of these leases, members of the Group may be liable for those defaults.
The number of such claims arising to date has been small and the cost, which is charged to profit and loss as it arises, has not been material.
HM Customs & Excise claim In August 2001 the Group introduced an optional insurance-backed structural guarantee on certain items of furniture sold in its UK retail stores.
Value Added Tax VAT on the furniture element of the transaction and Insurance Premium Tax IPT is paid on the sale of these warranties.
An assessment has been raised on the VAT on the sale of the warranties and the relevant tax has been paid to HM Customs & Excise.
The directors have taken extensive legal and taxation advice and this action is being contested vigorously.
The relevant tax, which has been paid, is carried on the balance sheet as a debtor without any provision on the basis that this amount is recoverable.
To date, the following amounts have been recorded: Cumulative 2004 2003 2002 2001 m m m m m Reduction in VAT 60.5 10.5 20.7 22.0 7.3 IPT paid 15.3 2.3 5.3 5.6 2.1 External insurance premium expenses 7.7 1.2 2.5 2.8 1.2 Reinsurance premium to Group company 12.5 2.1 4.2 4.5 1.7 Underwriting profit recognised by Group company 2.9 1.9 1.0 profit taken to profit and loss account 27.9 6.8 9.7 9.1 2.3 80% of the insurance has been reinsured by the external insurer through the Groups captive insurance company, Southon Insurance Company Limited.

HM Customs & Excise claim continued The maximum potential exposure, if the Group were to lose its case, is 60.5m at the year-end, but this would be expected to be offset by the recovery of approximately 15.3m of insurance premium tax paid on the sale of extended structural guarantees.
All of the 60.5m had been paid to HM Customs & Excise by the year-end.
