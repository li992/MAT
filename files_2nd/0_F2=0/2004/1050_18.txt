Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies a Basis of accounting and functional currency The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets as described in Note 11 and in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
The functional reporting currency of the Group is US dollars, the principal currency in which the Group operates and in which assets and liabilities are held.
Share capital is denominated in sterling and, for the purposes of reporting in US dollars, share capital and share premium are translated at the period end rate of exchange.
As explained in Note 7, dividends are paid in either US dollars or sterling.
b Change in presentation of turnover Los Pelambres produces copper and molybdenum concentrates, which are sold to smelters and roasting plants respectively for further processing.
Previously, turnover was measured based on the metallic content of the copper or molybdenum contained in the concentrate sold, and tolling charges representing the margin earned by the smelter or roasting plant in processing the concentrate sold were included in cost of sales.
As Los Pelambres does not retain any interest in the concentrate when sold, turnover has been restated by deducting tolling charges, previously included in cost of sales, to present the selling arrangements more appropriately.
The effect of this restatement on Group turnover is as follows: 2004 2003 US$m US$m Group turnover previous basis 2,037.1 1,076.2 Tolling charges previously included in cost of sales 128.4 98.2 Group turnover revised basis 1,908.7 978.0 The change in presentation has no effect on EBITDA, operating profit, profit before tax, net assets or shareholders funds in either year.
c Group financial statements and basis of consolidation The financial statements of the Group incorporate the consolidated assets, liabilities and results of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of are included in the financial statements from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.
73 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies continued d Currency translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into US dollars at year end rates of exchange.
Results denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into US dollars at the average rate for each year.
As explained in the Report of the Directors on page 46, the interim dividend was converted at US$1.8151 1, and the final dividend was converted at US$1.9183 1.
Year end rates Average rates 2004 US$1.9257 1: US$1 Ch$557 US$1.8457 1: US$1 Ch$607 2003 US$1.7727 1: US$1 Ch$594 US$1.6321 1: US$1 Ch$692 Exchange gains or losses principally arising from the translation of branch and subsidiary balances, hedging foreign currency denominated investments, and the restatement of results at the average rate, are taken directly to the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
e Goodwill Purchased goodwill is the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the aggregate fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired.
Any purchased goodwill is capitalised in the balance sheet at cost and amortised through the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
The gain or loss on subsequent disposal will include any attributable goodwill.
Internally generated goodwill is not capitalised.
Prior to 1998, purchased goodwill was eliminated against the profit and loss reserve and negative goodwill was credited to a separate capital reserve account.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets adopted in the 1998 financial statements, such amounts previously written off or credited to reserves were not reinstated as an asset, but will be charged or credited to the profit and loss account on disposal of the business to which they relate.
f Intangible fixed assets In 2003, the Groups wholly owned subsidiary, Aguas fide Antofagasta S. A. was awarded a 30 year concession to operate the water rights and facilities in the Antofagasta Region of Chile previously controlled by Empresa fide Servicios Sanitarios fide Antofagasta S. A. ESSAN.
An intangible fixed asset a concession right has been recognised in respect of the right to use those assets transferred by way of concession whose useful lives extend substantially beyond the period of the concession.
The concession right was measured as the difference between the cost of the concession and the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised on acquisition.
The concession right is amortised on a straight-line basis over the life of the concession.
g Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Fixed assets are stated at cost or, where previously revalued prior to the implementation of FRS 15, Tangible Fixed Assets, at the revalued book amount as permitted under the transitional provisions of FRS 15.
In determining cost, only costs directly attributable to bringing a fixed asset into working condition are capitalised.
Such costs include financing costs and the costs associated with a commissioning period until commercial levels of production have been achieved.
74 Non-incremental costs, including overhead costs incurred during a start-up period, are expensed.
ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 1 Accounting Policies continued Depreciation is provided on the following bases: i Land and mining properties mining properties including capitalised costs are depreciated in proportion to the volume of ore extracted in the year compared with total proven, probable and possible reserves.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
ii Buildings and infrastructure straight-line basis over 10 to 25 years.
iii Rail track and trackside equipment straight-line basis over 20 to 25 years.
iv Locomotives and rolling stock straight-line basis over 10 to 20 years.
v Machinery, equipment and other assets straight-line basis over 5 to 10 years.
vi Assets under construction no depreciation until asset is available for use.
h Associates Associated undertakings associates are accounted for under the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses include the Groups share of its associates results and share of its associates other recognised gains and losses respectively.
The consolidated balance sheet includes the Groups share of the net assets of its associates, as adjusted for any goodwill and fair values on acquisition.
i Other investments Other investments are stated at cost unless, in the opinion of the Directors, there has been a permanent impairment in value.
Income from other investments is recognised on a dividends received basis.
j Turnover Turnover represents the value of goods and services supplied during the year.
As explained in Note 1 b, turnover in respect of concentrate sales is stated net of tolling charges and comparatives have been restated to reflect the change in presentation.
In line with industry practice, copper concentrate sales agreements generally provide for provisional pricing of sales at the time of shipment with final pricing settlement based on the average LME copper price for specified future periods.
Sales which remain open to final pricing at the year-end are valued in aggregate at the lower of provisional invoice prices and mark-to-market forward prices at the balance sheet date.
Sales are subsequently adjusted for final pricing settlement when closed out the following year.
Details are given in Note 2 b iii.
Molybdenum concentrate sales are normally also priced on a similar basis, and a similar accounting policy is adopted except that spot prices are used in place of forward prices at the balance sheet date due to the absence of a futures market.
75 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements 1 Accounting Policies continued k Exploration expenditure Exploration is expensed in the year in which it is incurred.
When a decision is taken that a mining project is capable of production normally when the project has reached the pre-feasibility stage all further directly attributable pre-production expenditure is capitalised.
As explained in 1 g above, capitalisation of pre-production expenditure ceases when commercial levels of production are achieved.
l Stocks Stocks are included at the lower of cost or net realisable value.
The replacement cost of stocks is not considered to be materially in excess of book value.
m Pensions The Group makes payments into private pension plans for a limited number of employees.
These pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account in accordance with the contributions payable in the year.
The Group does not provide any other post-retirement benefits.
n Provision for severance indemnities Provision is made for severance indemnities which are payable on termination of employment or on the eventual closure of an operation with a finite life, based on the net present value of estimated future costs.
The release of the discount applied in establishing the net present value of future costs is charged to the profit and loss account in each accounting period and is disclosed as a financing cost.
o Provision for decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs Provision is made for decommissioning and site rehabilitation costs in the accounting period when the related environmental impact occurs, based on the net present value of estimated future costs to rectify the environmental impact.
Where an obligation is incurred in the course of acquiring or constructing tangible fixed assets, the discounted amount of the provision is capitalised and depreciated over the life of that asset.
p Provision for termination of water concession A provision for the termination of the water concession has been created for the fixed assets and working capital items under Aguas fide Antofagastas ownership to be transferred to the previous state-owned operator ESSAN at the end of the concession period.
The provision is based on the net present value of the estimated value of these assets and liabilities in existence at the end of the concession.
q Deferred tax Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current legislation.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations 76 in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 1 Accounting Policies continued No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of Chilean and other overseas subsidiaries, except to the extent that it is expected that any tax will become payable in the foreseeable future.
r Cash and net liquid resources Cash at bank and in hand includes amounts held in current accounts and demand deposits.
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, liquid resources include cash on deposit maturing within twelve months.
s Leases Tangible fixed assets acquired under finance leases are included in the balance sheet at their equivalent capital value and depreciated over their useful lives.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as a loan creditor and the interest element of the finance lease rentals is charged to the profit and loss account in proportion to the amounts outstanding.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease terms.
t Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative instruments to reduce exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and commodity price movements.
Derivative instruments are entered into for hedging purposes only.
i Commodity instruments: each hedging instrument is allocated against future production at the time of entering into the hedging instrument.
All gains and losses on hedging instruments are included in turnover when designated production is sold.
Premiums paid for individual options used to hedge future production are recognised as a deduction from turnover when the designated production is sold.
If the option lapses or is exercised and immediately settled, the premium paid is recognised as an expense on the option expiry date.
ii Financial instruments: interest rate swap agreements are used to fix or limit variations in interest rates on borrowings.
The differential payments made under such swaps are recognised by an adjustment to interest payable.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge transaction exposures.
These instruments are revalued at the balance sheet date with net unrealised losses and gains included in other debtors and other creditors and allocated against the underlying transaction when the hedged transactions occurs.
Gains and losses arising from instruments in respect of construction projects have been capitalised.

6 Tax on Profit on Ordinary Activities a Analysis of tax charge for the year The Company and all its subsidiaries are tax resident outside the United Kingdom and accordingly the Group is not subject to United Kingdom corporation tax.
Subsidiaries incorporated in Chile are liable to Chilean corporation tax at the rate of 17% 2003 16.5%, with further tax of 18% 2003 18.5% payable on profits distributed outside Chile.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates expected to apply in the period in which timing differences are expected to reverse.
The Group tax charge for the year comprises current and deferred tax as set out below.
2004 2003 US$m US$m Current tax charge for the year Chilean corporation tax 183.9 9.6 Deferred tax charge for the year origination and reversal of timing differences 54.8 54.8 Tax charge for the year 238.7 64.4 Other overseas corporation tax amounted to less than US$0.1 million in both years.
b Analysis of deferred tax provision at the end of the year The deferred tax provision at the end of the year is analysed below between its main components.
The movement in the deferred tax provision during the year is analysed in Note 20 together with provisions for other liabilities and charges.
No deferred tax has been provided on gains recognised on the revaluation of freehold land and railway track as it is not envisaged that any tax will be payable in the foreseeable future.
If these assets were sold at their revalued amounts, additional tax of US$2.8 million 2003 US$2.6 million could become payable.
Further details of the revaluation are given in Note 11.
The deferred tax charge for the year includes US$36.0 million for withholding taxes relating to profits earned in Chile which are expected to be remitted abroad.
This is the principal reason the effective tax rate for the year is 20.5% compared to the Chilean statutory tax rate of 17%.
During 2003, withholding taxes provided amounted to US$8.6 million of which US$7.5 million was included in current tax and US$1.1 million included in deferred tax.
This was the principal reason for an effective tax rate of 18.0% compared with the Chilean statutory rate that year of 16.5%.
84 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 6 Tax on Profit on Ordinary Activities continued b Analysis of deferred tax provision at the end of the year continued Up to and including 2003, tax at Los Pelambres and El Tesoro was provided mainly on a deferred basis due to the absorption of tax losses.
Under Chilean tax legislation, full relief is given for pre-operational costs on the start-up of a mining project, and capital allowances are available on an accelerated basis for expenditure relating to the construction or purchase of tangible fixed assets.
These factors resulted in a large deferred tax liability between 2000 and 2003 when these initial costs were deducted for tax purposes but were not fully depreciated through the financial accounts.
The tax losses arising on the relief on pre-operational costs and capital allowances were absorbed in early 2004, resulting in a significantly larger current tax charge and lower deferred tax charge at these operations compared with previous years.
Current tax due at the end of 2004 is expected to be paid during the first half of 2005.

All other shareholders are paid by cheque in dollars, unless they have previously instructed the Companys registrar to pay dividends by bank transfer to a sterling bank account, or they elect for payment by cheque in sterling.
The Companys registrar must receive any such election before the record date of 13 May 2005.
The Board has recommended a final dividend of 64 cents per ordinary share 2003 24 cents, which comprises an ordinary dividend of 24 cents and a special dividend of 40 cents.
The final dividend will be paid on 15 June 2005 to shareholders on the Register at the close of business on 13 May 2005.
Dividends are declared and paid gross.
The exchange rate to be applied for the conversion of the final dividend will be 1 US$1.9183, giving a final dividend to those shareholders paid in sterling of 33.3629 pence per ordinary share 2003 12.8404 pence.
An interim dividend of 15 cents per ordinary share 2003 11 cents was paid on 8 October 2004.
The exchange rate applied to the conversion of the ordinary dividend was 1 US$1.8151, giving an interim dividend to those shareholders paid in sterling of 8.2640 pence per ordinary share 2003 6.8966 pence.
In October 2003, the Group made a dividend in specie of shares in Andsberg Limited the demerger dividend, which was recorded in the profit and loss account at the book value of the assets demerged i. e. US$181.5 million in the consolidated financial statements and US$16.0 million in the parent company financial statements.
No comparable transaction occurred in 2004.

A. ATI, a company incorporated in Chile which operates the sole concession to manage installations in the port of Antofagasta.
The investment, acquired at a cost of US$2.9 million, has been accounted for as an interest in associate and did not have any material effect on the Groups earnings or operating cash flows in the year.
Joint Venture Agreement The Group has a joint venture agreement, entered into during 2002, with Companhia Vale do Rio Doce CVRD of Brazil, with the objective of developing mineral exploration activities in a defined area of interest in Southern Peru.
Under the 91 ANTOFAGASTA PLC Annual Report and Financial Statements 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements 13 Investment in Associate and Joint Ventures continued Joint Venture Agreement continued joint venture agreement, the Group transferred its mining rights in the area of interest into Cordillera fide Las Minas S. A. CVRD committed to invest US$6.7 million over a three-year period in mineral exploration in the area of interest, and in exchange the Group granted CVRD an option to increase its interest to 50% by completing the agreed investment.
The joint venture agreement also provides for equal participation by the Group and CVRD in its management and operation.
As explained in Note 1 k, the Groups policy is to expense and not capitalise exploration as incurred, and therefore the contribution of mining properties under the joint venture agreement by the Group, the contribution of funds by CVRD and subsequent exploration expenditure under the joint venture agreement has no effect on the Groups profit and loss, cash flows or balance sheet.
