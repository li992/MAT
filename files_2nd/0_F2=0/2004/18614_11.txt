Details of the effect of the prior year Derivative financial instruments adjustment are shown in note 21.
The group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
For an interest rate swap to be treated as a hedge the instrument must be related to actual assets or liabilities or a probable commitment and must change the nature of the interest rate by converting a fixed rate to a variable rate or vice versa.
Interest differentials under these swaps are recognised by adjusting net interest payable over the periods of the contracts.
If an instrument ceases to be accounted for as a hedge, for example because the underlying hedged position is eliminated, the instrument is marked to market and any resulting profit or loss recognised at that time.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is measured at the rate expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all evidence available, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred taxation is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless by the balance sheet date there is a binding agreement to sell the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on the sale has been recognised in the financial statements.
