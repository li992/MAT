b Ore resources refer to material of intrinsic economic interest occurring in such form and quantity that there are reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction.
Ore reserves refer to that part of a resource for which appropriate assessments have been carried out to demonstrate at a given date that extraction could be reasonably justified and which include consideration of and modification by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social and governmental factors.
Resources are stated inclusive of reserves.
c The operations at Michilla comprise an open pit mine, an underground mine and other workings.
A cut off grade of 0.5% was applied to the open pit mine, a cut off grade of 1.5% to the underground mine and a cut off grade of 1.0% to the other workings to determine the reserve and resource calculations.
d The individual reserves and resources figures are sometimes more specific than the rounded numbers shown: hence small differences may appear in totals.
