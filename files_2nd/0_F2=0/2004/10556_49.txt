This has resulted in the reclassification of own shares held in employee trusts from investments to shareholders funds and has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment, 0.7 million.
These shares will be used to satisfy awards granted under share or share option schemes.
During the year the shares with a nominal value of 3.4 million purchased to satisfy awards granted under the new long-term incentive plan, the 2004 LTIP, have also been recognised as a deduction from shareholders funds.
The shares are held in a trust administered by Bermuda Trust Jersey Limited and are distributed by them in a discretionary settlement governed by the rules of the 2004 LTIP and the Trust deed dated 1 March 1996.
The total number of own shares held by the Trust at 4 January 2005 is 2,720,080 2003: 336,064 and at that date had a market value of 4,705,738.
The Group has adopted UITF Abstract 17 Revised Employee share schemes.
At the Annual General Meeting in 2004, shareholders approved the introduction of a new long-term incentive plan the 2004 LTIP and a new executive share option scheme the 2004 ESOS.
Participation in the 2004 LTIP is offered to the executive Directors and other key executives.
In 2004, awards were made to 57 employees round the world, including the executive Directors.
Participation in the 2004 ESOS is generally offered to other senior executives.
In 2004, options were granted to 113 employees round the world.
Mr M Robertshaw received grants under both plans shortly after joining the Company, as is common market practice.
Awards under both the 2004 LTIP and the 2004 ESOS will vest on the third anniversary of the date of grant, but only to the extent that the Companys total shareholder return TSR can be viewed favourably when compared with the TSR of a group of comparator companies.
For the grants made in 2004, the comparator group is the companies which made up the FTSE 350 Index at the date of grant.
If the Companys TSR over the three financial years 20042006 places it at the median of the comparator group, 30% of an award will vest and an award will only vest in full if the Companys TSR places it in the upper quartile of the comparator group.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that the Companys underlying financial performance over the period justifies vesting.
A Special Resolution to cancel the Share Premium Account was passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 11 June 1993.
This cancellation was confirmed by an Order of the High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, on 14 July 1993.
The amount of 88.9 million standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 14 July 1993 was transferred to the Special reserve against which goodwill on consolidation can be written off.
This reserve, together with the amounts standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account on 12 October 1990 of 71.5 million, on 19 June 1987 of 38.9 million and on 27 July 1989 of 12.3 million which were transferred following previous Orders of the High Court, becomes distributable to the extent of subsequent increases in issued share capital and Share Premium Account.
The amount of reserves of The Morgan Crucible Company plc that may not be distributed under Section 264 3 of the Companies Act l985 is 205.4 million 2003: 207.5 million.
The cumulative amount of goodwill eliminated against reserves in respect of subsidiary undertakings continuing to trade as members of the Group and which has not subsequently been written off through the profit and loss account is 188.9 million 2003: 205.0 million.
The 188.9 million has been debited against the Merger reserve 77.7 million and the Special reserve 111.2 million.
