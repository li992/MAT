A separate Company profit and Loss Account dealing with the results of Woolworths Group plc the Company has not been presented, as permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
Accounting Policies Accounting Conventions The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are prepared under the historical cost convention, except for certain land and buildings that are included in the financial statements at valuation, and are prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom and Companies Act 1985.
These financial statements reect the adoption of the amendment to Financial Reporting Standard 5 FRS 5 Application note G on Reporting the Substance of Transactions.
Prior year numbers have been restated, details of which are included within note 3.
Basis for Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures and associated undertakings.
Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase consideration over the fair value of attributable net assets at the date of acquisition.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method.
Turnover Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards of the underlying products and services have been substantially transferred to the customer.
Foreign Currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at contracted rates or, where no contract exists, at average monthly rates.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies which are held at the year-end are translated into sterling at year-end exchange rates.
Exchange differences on monetary items are taken to the profit and Loss Account.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets Intangible assets, which comprise goodwill arising on acquisitions and acquired licences and copyrights, are stated at cost less amortisation.
Purchased goodwill arising on acquisitions is treated as an asset on the Balance Sheet and is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life not exceeding 20 years.
In estimating the useful economic life of goodwill arising, account is taken of the nature of the business acquired, the stability of the industry, the extent of continuing barriers to market entry and expected future impact of competition.
With the exception of Streets Online Limited which has been fully provided for, all acquisitions are considered by the Directors to have an estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
Acquired licences and copyrights are amortised over the period of the underlying legal agreements, which do not exceed 20 years.
Depreciation Tangible xed assets are stated at cost valuation less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is provided where it is necessary to reect a reduction from book value to estimated residual value over the estimated useful life of the asset to the Group.
Depreciation of tangible xed assets is calculated by the straight-line method and the annual rates applicable to the principal categories are: Freeholds 2 per cent Long leaseholds 5 per cent Short leaseholds over the life of the lease Tenants improvements shorter of the estimated useful life and the remaining life of the store lease Fixtures and ttings between 10 per cent and 15 per cent Computers and electronic equipment between 20 per cent and 50 per cent Motor cars 25 per cent 1 Commercial vehicles 33 3 per cent As permitted by Financial Reporting Standard 15 Tangible Fixed Assets the Group has adopted a policy of not revaluing freehold properties and previously revalued freehold properties are included at their valuation less accumulated depreciation.
30 Woolworths Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 Notes to the Accounts continued Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill When a review for impairment is conducted, the recoverable amount is assessed by comparison of the carrying value of the asset against the higher of net realisable value or value in use.
The value in use is determined from estimated discounted future cash ows.
Discount rates used are based on the circumstances of the individual businesses.
Disposal of Land and Buildings profits and losses on disposal of land and buildings represent the difference between the net proceeds and the net carrying value at the date of sale.
Sales are accounted for when there is an unconditional exchange of contracts or where the completion cannot be unreasonably withheld.
Operating Leases All operating lease payments are charged to the profit and Loss Account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Stocks Stocks, which solely comprise nished goods, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes appropriate attributable overheads.
Provisions are made for obsolescence, mark-down and shrinkage.
Rebates Receivable from Suppliers Volume related rebates receivable from suppliers are credited to the carrying value of the stock to which they relate.
Where a rebate agreement with a supplier covers more than one year the rebates are recognised in the period in which they are earned.
Pensions Companies within the Group offer either a dened benefit scheme or facilitate a Stakeholder arrangement for employees.
The dened benefit scheme is a separate fund and is being held in a separately administered trust to meet the actuarial liabilities.
The estimated costs of pensions in respect of the dened benefit scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so that they are spread over the working lives of employees.
Variations to pension costs arising at each actuarial valuation date caused by differences between the assumptions used and actual experience are spread over the average future working lifetime of employees.
Further details which also include the Groups adoption of the transitional arrangements for Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benets are provided in note 30.
Deferred Taxation Provision is made for deferred taxation using the full provision method in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 19 Deferred Taxation.
A deferred tax asset is only recognised when it is more likely than not that the asset will be recoverable in the foreseeable future out of suitable taxable profits from which the underlying timing difference can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not discounted.
Derivative Financial Instruments Financial assets are recognised on the Balance Sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Discounts and premia are charged or credited to the profit and Loss Account over the life of the asset or liability to which they relate.
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for by using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability.
Where such instruments do not hedge an underlying asset or liability, they are accounted for using fair value accounting.
When a financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the instrument will thereafter be marked to its fair value in the financial statements.
Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments for hedging purposes is recognised on an accruals basis, and credited or charged to the profit and Loss Account in the financial period in which it arises.
Gains or losses on financial instruments accounted for on a fair value basis are reected in the profit and Loss Account as they arise.
ESOP The Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP is a separately administered trust.
Liabilities of the ESOP are guaranteed by the Company and the assets of the ESOP mainly comprise shares in the Company.
In accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 13 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, the assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOP have been included in the accounts of the Company.

Segmental Analysis The Group changed the basis of its segmental reporting during the year.
Retail and Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing segments have been introduced to provide a better understanding of the Groups business and as a result a better indication of past and future performance.
Accordingly, Woolworths, MVC and Streets Online are included within the Retail segment with Entertainment UK and VCI making up Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing.
Turnover Turnover arises in the UK only and represents retail and wholesale distribution sales and other services.
Turnover excludes Value Added Tax.
The analysis of turnover by destination is not materially different to the analysis of turnover by origin.
Restated 2004 2003 m m a Turnover by origin continuing operations Retail 2,284.9 2,293.7 Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing 1,165.2 1,055.4 Intergroup 675.4 658.6 Group Turnover 2,774.7 2,690.5 Intergroup turnover wholly relates to Entertainment Wholesale and Publishing.
VCI plc, one of the Groups principal subsidiaries, sold the trade and assets of its distribution business, Disc Distribution Limited, on 31 May 2002.
This business reported sales for the five months to 31 May 2002 of 17.5 million and an operating loss of 2.5 million.
In October 2003 Woolworths outsourced its in-store caf operation.
In accordance with FRS 5, gross sales are shown up to the date of transfer and the commission earned since that date is included within other operating income.
The introduction of electronic top-up for mobile phones has progressively replaced the use of phone vouchers in the past year.
Woolworths acts as principal in the selling of mobile phone card vouchers and consequently includes gross sales as turnover.
However, where Woolworths provides a facility for electronic top-up, it acts as an agent and commissions arising are shown as other operating income.
The Group has adopted the Amendment to Financial Reporting Standard 5 FRS 5 Reporting the Substance of Transactions Application note G Revenue Recognition which was issued in November 2003.
The main impact of changes arising from the change in accounting policy are as follows: 1.
The removal of agency sales from the reported turnover.
The derecognition of expected sales returns for sales made on a sale or return basis which had previously been provided for on a net basis.
Turnover is now stated at fair value of the right to consideration which is net of all discounts.
Customer rebates and staff discounts are now treated as a reduction in turnover rather than as a cost of sale.
2004 2003 m m Turnover as previously disclosed 2,717.4 Restated for FRS 5 26.9 Group Turnover 2,774.7 2,690.5 The adoption of FRS 5 Application note G has resulted in the restatement of prior year turnover with a corresponding reduction to cost of sales of 26.1 million and an increase to other operating income of 0.8 million.
There is no impact on the prior year profit before taxation or the taxation charge.
The impact on the prior year balance sheet has been a reclassication between stock and debtors of 8.7 million.
There has been no impact on current year profit before taxation or the taxation charge.
Classication of the items referred to above is in line with the prior year.
In addition there has been a reclassication of advertising contributions from suppliers between cost of sales and selling expenses.

Pension Costs During the year the Group announced changes to the Woolworths Group Pension Scheme a funded dened benefit scheme and the Woolworths Group Retirement Trust a dened contribution scheme.
These were aimed at providing appropriate arrangements with secure funding for the Group.
Woolworths Group Retirement Trust WGRT Colleagues who joined after 3 June 2003 are no longer eligible to join the WGRT although existing membership is allowed to continue.
Payments to the WGRT are charged against profits as incurred.
The pension cost for this scheme, charged to the profit and loss account, is 0.6 million, reecting contributions paid to the WGRT 2003: ten months 0.6 million.
Woolworths Group Pension Scheme WGPS Colleagues who joined after 3 June 2003 are now subject to different eligibility conditions and terms within the WGPS.
Actuarial valuation Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs The pension cost calculated in accordance with the SSAP 24 accounting standard has been assessed by independent actuaries, based on a valuation of the WGPS as at 1 April 2002 using the projected unit method and the following principal financial assumptions.
Price ination 2.8 Pay increases 3.8 Pension increases 2.7 Discount rate before retirement 7.25 Discount rate after retirement 6.0 Assets were taken at market value, 165.2 million, and represented 94.7 per cent of the value of the schemes liabilities after allowing for future pay increases.
The past service deficit on the SSAP 24 assumptions therefore amounted to 9.3 million.
This deficit has been amortised over the average future working lifetime of the schemes active members 8.4 years using the percentage of payroll method.
The Group has continued to contribute to the WGPS at the rate of 13.5 per cent of pensionable pay.
The Groups contribution rate will be reviewed at the next formal valuation, due no later than 1 April 2005.
Under SSAP 24 the pension cost for the year to 31 January 2004 is 16.2 million 2003: 17.0 million, which is split into a regular cost of 15.0 million 2003: 15.7 million and a variation of 1.2 million 2003: 1.3 million.
This includes 0.4 million in respect of contributions from companies who are participating in the WGPS in respect of outsourced areas of the business.
The Groups funding policy differs from the accounting policy to the extent that different assumptions are used in setting the funding policy of the scheme.
The funding policy has been set using the following assumptions per annum : a discount rate for past service benets of 6.25 per cent, a discount rate for future service benets of 6.5 per cent, pay increases of 4.0 per cent, and price ination and pension increases of 2.5 per cent.
