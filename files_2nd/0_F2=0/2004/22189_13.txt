The sale of Cattles Commercial Finance Limited and its subsidiary, Cattles Commercial Leasing Limited, on 14 January 2005 does not represent a material reduction in the groups turnover or have a material effect on the nature and focus of the groups operations, therefore the results of these businesses are included above within continuing operations.
The only recognised gains and losses for the year are those dealt with in the profit and loss account above.
There is no material difference between the profit before taxation and the retained profit for the year as shown above and their historical cost equivalents.
