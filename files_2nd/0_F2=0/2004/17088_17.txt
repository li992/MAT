Notes to the accounts 1 Changes to accounting policies The Urgent Issues Task Force abstracts 17 as amended Employee share schemes and 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts have been adopted in the current year.
The comparatives have been restated to comply with these abstracts.
Operating profit has been reduced by 1.2m 2002 3 0.4m as a consequence of changes in the basis of calculating the charges to the profit and loss account and the timing of their recognition.
Other investments and reserves have been reduced by 6.7m 2003 6.7m as a result of these changes and the requirement to deduct the cost of the Whitbread shares held to satisfy share based payments from reserves.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in UITF 17 as amended and has not applied the abstract to Inland Revenue approved SAYE option schemes.
The analysis in the profit and loss detail in note 3 has been adjusted to reflect the current profile of the groups businesses, which are predominantly retail businesses.
The major change is that costs of operating outlets are now classified as distribution costs, whereas previously they were classified as cost of sales.
Comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
The effect on the 2002 3 numbers has been to: reduce cost of sales by 814.3m: increase distribution to customers by 834.1m: and to reduce administration and other costs by 19.8m.
There is no effect on group operating profit.
Although the third stage of the FRS 17 Retirement Benefits transitional arrangements has been adopted there have been no changes to the reported figures which continue to be prepared on the basis of SSAP 24.
The disclosures required under this stage of the transitional arrangements are included in note 7 to the accounts.

page 60 Whitbread PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2003 4 7 Pensions The defined benefit final salary section of the principal group pension scheme, the Whitbread Group Pension Fund, which was available to eligible UK full-time and part-time employees, was closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
There was also a defined contribution scheme available to employees which was also closed to new members on 31 December 2001.
Both schemes are funded and contributions by both employees and group companies are held in externally invested trustee-administered funds.
Members of these schemes are contracted out of the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme.
A replacement, contracted-in, defined contribution arrangement was established as a section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund with effect from 1 April 2002.
The total non government pension cost for the group, including directors, is analysed below: 2003 4 2002 3 m m Funded schemes 8.8 10.5 Unfunded scheme 0.4 0.5 Overseas schemes 0.1 9.3 11.0 The pension cost relating to the defined benefit section of the Whitbread Group Pension Fund is assessed in accordance with actuarial advice from Hewitt, Bacon & Woodrow, using the projected unit credit valuation basis.
As the scheme is now closed to new members the current service cost, under the projected unit credit valuation basis, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement although the overall cost will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The pension cost for the year has been based on the latest actuarial valuation which was carried out as at 31 March 2002.
The assumptions were derived from market yields.
Separate assumptions were made for the discount rate used to value liabilities and the return expected on the assets.
The value of the assets was calculated as an average of the market values over the past 3 years.
The main valuation assumptions were that the return on investments would be 4.9% per annum above inflation, that the discount rate would be 3.4% per annum above inflation until retirement and 2.9% per annum above inflation thereafter, that the annual increase in pensionable salaries including promotional increases would be 2.0% above inflation and that the annual increase in pensions in payment would average 0.1% per annum below inflation.
The regular cost is derived as the service cost calculated using the real discount rates set out above less an adjustment reflecting the excess of the expected return on the assets over interest on the liabilities.
The average expected remaining service life of current employees is 8 years.
Since the valuation date, the value of the assets of the Fund has fallen in line with investment markets generally.
If the value of investments does not recover, pension cost is likely to rise following the next valuation of the Fund due as at 31 March 2005.
Membership of the defined benefit section of the fund at 4 March 2004 was 4,598 2003 6,079.
The increase in the pension prepayment included in debtors note 20 represents funding paid to Whitbread Group Pension Fund in excess of the pension cost.
The Board announced in April 2003 that the company had signed an agreement with Whitbread Pension Trustees Limited.
Under that agreement, the company has undertaken to fund the pension scheme for a period of up to 15 years and given undertakings to the trustees similar to some of the covenants provided in respect of its banking agreements.
As a consequence of this agreement, payments are being made into the fund for each of the next three years starting in 2003 4, at a rate of 15m above the anticipated SSAP 24 charge.
There will be no change to the charge to the profit and loss account, as a consequence of this agreement, before the next triennial valuation in March 2005.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits will change fundamentally the calculation and reporting of the cost of retirement benefits.
