Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and company law except as set out below in respect of intangible fixed assets.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to the same period end as the Group.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold are consolidated for the periods from or to the date on which control passed.
Acquisitions On the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, the excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair value of tangible fixed assets, other assets and liabilities acquired, represents goodwill, which is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out under intangible fixed assets.
Intangible fixed assets The Groups intangible assets represent licence value, goodwill and brand value.
Intangible assets such as licences and brands that are purchased as part of a business cannot be measured reliably and are therefore subsumed within purchased goodwill in accordance with paragraph 13 of FRS10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
The Companies Act 1985 requires goodwill and intangible assets to be amortised over a finite period.
The directors consider that the Groups intangible assets have an indefinite life due to: the fact that the Group is a significant operator in a well established market: the proven and sustained demand for bookmaking services and greyhound racing: the operation of current law that acts as a barrier to entry for new entrants: and the Groups track record of successfully renewing its betting permits and licences.
Consequently, the directors consider that to amortise these assets would not provide a true and fair view and so the financial statements depart from this specific requirement of the Companies Act 1985.
If this departure from the Companies Act 1985 had not been made, the profit for the financial period would have been reduced by amortisation.
The amount of this amortisation cannot be quantified because of the indefinite life of these assets.
The non-amortisation of the intangible assets means that they are subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with FRS10 and FRS11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated in the consolidated balance sheet at cost, less provision, if any, for impairment together with additions at cost, less cumulative depreciation.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life, as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Long leasehold properties 50 years Short leasehold properties over the unexpired period of the lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment and motor vehicles at variable rates between 3 and 10 years Web site development costs Design and content development costs are capitalised only to the extent that they lead to the creation of an enduring asset delivering benefits at least as great as the amount capitalised.
If there is insufficient evidence on which to base reasonable estimates of the economic benefits that will be generated in the period until the design and content are next updated, the costs of developing the design and content are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Investments Fixed asset investments are shown at cost less provision, if any, for impairment.
In the Company balance sheet, cost is measured by reference to the nominal value only of the shares issued for investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration that includes the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief.
40 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Statement of Accounting Policies Associates Shares in associated undertakings are accounted for using the equity method.
The consolidated profit and loss account includes the Groups share of profit on ordinary activities before finance charges, attributable finance charges and attributable taxation of associated undertakings.
In the consolidated balance sheet, the investment in associated undertakings is shown as the Groups share of net assets or liabilities of associated undertakings and the unamortised element of goodwill relating to the acquisition of associated undertakings.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out under intangible fixed assets.
Stocks Stocks represent stocks of consumables in stores and goods for resale within the greyhound stadia.
They are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Tax Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the Groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only if and when the replacement assets are sold.
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
Revenue recognition and turnover In accordance with Application Note G to Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions, revenue is recognised under an exchange transaction with a customer, when, and to the extent that, the Group obtains the right to consideration in exchange for its performance.
Turnover is the revenue resulting from exchange transactions under which the Group supplies to customers the services that it is in business to provide as set out below.
In the case of the LBO, telephone and interactive sportsbook businesses including FOBTs, games on the online arcade and other numbers bets, turnover represents the gross takings receivable from customers in respect of individual bets placed, on events that have occurred by the period end.
In the case of AWPs and the online casino operation, turnover represents the net winnings excluding VAT from customers on gaming activity completed by the period end.
Turnover from the online poker business reflects the net income rake earned from poker games completed by the period end.
In the case of the greyhound stadia, turnover represents income arising from the operation of the greyhound stadia in the period, including sales of refreshments and tote income.
Leases Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account in equal amounts over the periods of the leases.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to sign an operating lease are similarly spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where the period to the review date on which the rent is first expected to be adjusted to the prevailing market rate is shorter than the full lease term, in which case the shorter period is used.
41 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Statement of Accounting Policies Statement of Accounting Policies Pensions The Group operates a defined contribution scheme and a defined benefit scheme open to eligible employees in the Group.
The assets of the schemes are held and managed separately from those of the Group.
For the defined contribution scheme the amount charged to the profit and loss account in respect of pension costs and other post-retirement benefits represents the contributions payable in the period.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
For the defined benefit scheme the Group has adopted the provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits in that the amounts charged to operating profit are the current service costs and gains and losses on settlements and curtailments.
They are included as part of staff costs.
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account if the benefits have vested.
If the benefits have not vested immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting occurs.
The interest cost and the expected return on assets are shown as a net amount of other finance costs or income.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and term to the scheme liabilities.
The actuarial valuations are obtained at least triennially and are updated at each balance sheet date.
The resulting defined benefit asset or liability, net of the related deferred tax, is presented separately after other net assets on the face of the balance sheet.
Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction or at an average rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences arising are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
The results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the average rates of exchange and the assets and liabilities at closing rates of exchange.
Differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets and from translating results at average rates and assets and liabilities at closing rates are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of that debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is reduced by payments made in the period.
Accrued finance costs are included within accruals and deferred income.
Derivative financial instruments Derivative instruments utilised by the Group are interest rate swaps.
The Group does not enter into speculative derivative contracts.
All such instruments are used for hedging purposes to alter the risk profile of an existing underlying exposure of the Group in line with the Groups risk management policies.
Amounts payable or receivable in respect of interest rate swaps are recognised as adjustments to interest expense over the period of the contracts.
Termination payments made or received are spread over the life of the underlying exposure in cases where the underlying exposure continues to exist.
In other cases termination payments are taken to the profit and loss account.
Own shares held Own shares held in treasury and held in employment benefit trusts are included within reserves.
Share based payments The minimum expense recognised in respect of discretionary share awards and options is the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of award and the amount that an employee may be required to pay for the shares.
No expense is recognised in respect of the Groups Save As You Earn schemes.
42 William Hill PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements Notes to the Financial Statements 1.
Changes in accounting policies and restatement of comparatives The Group has adopted Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and the related amendments to Abstract 17 Employee share schemes issued by the Urgent Issues Task Force in December 2003.
The provisions of Abstract 38 change the presentation of an entitys own shares held in trust from requiring them to be recognised as assets within investments, to requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholders funds.
As a result of the change in accounting policy in respect of Abstract 38, the comparatives have been restated as follows: 30 December 2003 m Investments As previously reported 3.6 Reclassification of own shares held 2.8 As restated 0.8 Shareholders funds As previously reported 320.2 Reclassification of own shares held 2.8 As restated 317.4 The amount representing own shares held was 4.4m at 31 December 2002.
Amended Abstract 17 requires that the minimum expense recognised in respect of share awards and options should be the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of award and the amount that an employee may be required to pay for the shares the intrinsic value.
The expense was previously determined either as the intrinsic value or, where purchases of shares had been made by a trust at fair value, by reference to the cost of shares that were available for the award.
The impact of adopting the amended Abstract 17 amounted to an additional charge of 1.0m against profit before tax in the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 1.3m.
In addition to the 1.3m charged in 2003, 0.6m was charged in periods prior to this, giving a total prior period adjustment of 1.9m reported in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.

Other activities include oncourse betting and greyhound stadia operations.
The directors believe that gross win and operating profit are more important performance metrics than turnover.
Net assets liabilities have been allocated by segment where assets and liabilities can be identified with a particular channel.
Corporate net assets include goodwill, corporation and deferred tax, borrowings net of cash balances, pension liability and dividends payable as well as any assets and liabilities that cannot be allocated to a particular channel other than on a relatively arbitrary basis.
Turnover of 3.3m and a small operating loss of 0.1m has been consolidated into these results in respect of the acquisitions made by the Group as detailed in note 17.

Tax on profit on ordinary activities The tax charge comprises: 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004 30 December 2003 m m UK corporation tax at 30% 57.4 50.3 UK corporation tax prior periods 1.7 0.8 Consortium relief receivable prior periods 1.1 Overseas tax 0.3 0.2 Share of associated undertaking tax charge 1.0 0.8 Total current tax charge 57.0 49.0 Deferred tax origination and reversal of timing differences 3.8 Total tax on profit on ordinary activities 57.0 45.2 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004 30 December 2003 % % Effective tax rate 27.8 26.7 The effective tax rate is lower than the statutory tax rate of 30% mainly due to relief for brought forward losses for which deferred tax was not previously recognised and prior year adjustments.
The differences between the total current tax shown above and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK corporation tax to the profit before tax is as follows: 52 weeks ended 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004 30 December 2003 restated m m Profit on ordinary activities before taxation 205.3 169.5 Tax on Group profit on ordinary activities at standard UK corporation tax rate of 30% 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 30% 61.6 50.9 Accelerated capital allowances 2.2 0.2 Adjustment in respect of prior periods 1.7 2.3 Other short term timing differences 1.3 0.5 Permanent differences 0.5 1.1 Held over gains crystallising 0.5 0.7 Utilisation of tax losses 3.0 1.7 Total current tax charge 57.0 49.0 The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for UK corporation tax, currently 30%.

Tax on profit on ordinary activities continued The elements of deferred tax assets liabilities shown on the balance sheet are as follows: 28 December 2004 30 December 2003 m m Accelerated capital allowances 1.2 1.0 Held over gains 0.1 0.6 Other short term timing differences 1.3 Tax losses to be recovered 6.5 5.8 Deferred tax asset shown in debtors note 19 6.5 6.2 Deferred tax on pension liability note 24 16.5 13.6 23.0 19.8 Movement in the period: Asset at beginning of period 19.8 14.9 Amount credited to profit and loss account 3.8 Amount credited to statement of total recognised gains and losses 3.2 1.1 Asset at end of period 23.0 19.8 The current rate of corporation tax of 30% has been used to calculate the amount of deferred tax.
Provision has been made for all deferred tax assets and liabilities in respect of accelerated capital allowances, held over capital gains, short term timing differences and tax losses arising from transactions recognised in the financial statements of the current and previous periods.
The Group had the following unprovided deferred tax liabilities assets : 28 December 2004 30 December 2003 m m Rollover gains 3.2 2.5 Capital losses 1.7 Tax losses 10.1 13.4 8.6 10.9 No provision has been made for the deferred tax liability of 3.2m 30 December 2003 2.5m in respect of capital gains rolled over into nondepreciating assets as it is the intention to retain these assets for the foreseeable future.
Tax on these rolled over gains would only become payable if the assets were sold without further rollover relief.
Deferred tax assets of 11.8m 30 December 2003 13.4m in respect of carried forward tax losses have not been recognised, as it is not expected that suitable taxable profits will arise in the foreseeable future to utilise these losses.
The Company has no provided or unprovided deferred tax assets or liabilities.
Profit attributable to William Hill PLC The profit after tax for the period, dealt with in the financial statements of the parent company William Hill PLC, was 198.4m 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 308.1m.

The proposed final dividend of 11.0p 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 9.0p will be paid on 2 June 2005 to all shareholders on the register on 6 May 2005.
Under an agreement signed in November 2002, The William Hill Holdings 2001 Employee Benefit Trust agreed to waive all dividends.
As at 28 December 2004, the trust held 2.8m ordinary shares.
In addition, the Company has not provided for dividends on the 10.5m shares held in Treasury.
The Company estimates that 391.6m shares will qualify for the final dividend.

The investment has been accounted for as an associated undertaking using the net equity method and the change in the Groups share of its net assets is shown above.
The SIS group of companies provides real time preevent information and results, as well as live coverage of horse racing, greyhound racing and certain numbers draws, via satellite.
The statutory financial statements of SIS are prepared to the year ending 31 March.
The consolidated figures above are based on management accounts for the calendar year 2004.
A provision was made in 1999 against goodwill relating to the acquisition of shares in SIS to recognise impairment in the carrying value.
William Hill Organization Limited holds directly or indirectly 33% of the entire share capital of Lucky Choice Limited and of 49s Limited.
These companies were formed for the purpose of promoting and publicising certain numbers betting formats.
In the opinion of the directors, the results of these companies are not material to the results of the Group.
Consequently, the investments have been stated at cost and have not been accounted for under the net equity method, which would normally be appropriate for an associated undertaking.

Pro forma financial information for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004 The Group is preparing for the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards as its primary accounting basis for the period ending 26 December 2006.
The Groups date of adoption and transition will therefore be the 29 December 2004 as comparative information will be prepared for the accounting period beginning on this date.
The pro forma financial information for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004 has been prepared for illustrative purposes only.
It has been prepared on the basis that the IFRS transition date is 30 December 2003.
The actual transition date will be 29 December 2004.
The proforma financial information has been extracted from the audited IFRS financial statements.
These extracts do not contain sufficient information to allow a full understanding of the results and state of affairs of the Group in accordance with IFRS.
The full IFRS financial statements are published on William Hill PLCs corporate information web site www.
Basis of accounting The financial information presented in this document has been prepared on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, including International Accounting Standards IAS and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and its committees, and as interpreted by any regulatory bodies applicable to the Group.
These are subject to ongoing amendment by the IASB and subsequent endorsement by the European Commission and are therefore subject to possible change.
As a result, information contained within the pro-forma IFRS financial statements will require updating for any subsequent amendment to IFRS required for first time adoption or those new standards that the Group may elect to adopt early.
In preparing this financial information, the Group has assumed that the European Commission will endorse the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits Actuarial Gains and Losses, Group Plans and Disclosures.
On 19 November 2004, the European Commission endorsed an amended version of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement rather than the full version as previously published by the IASB.
In accordance with guidance issued by the UK Accounting Standards Board, the full version of IAS 39, as issued by the IASB, has been adopted in the preparation of this financial information.
First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS for the first time.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in note 5.
IFRS 1 sets out the procedures that the Group must follow when it adopts IFRS for the first time as the basis for preparing its consolidated financial statements.
Under IFRS 1 the Group will be required to establish its IFRS accounting policies as at 26 December 2006 and, in general, apply these retrospectively to determine the IFRS opening balance sheet at its date of transition, 29 December 2004.
IFRS 1 provides a number of optional exceptions to this general principle.
The most significant of these are set out below, together with a description in each case of whether an exception has been adopted by the Group.
Business combinations The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the 30 December 2003.
As a result, in the opening balance sheet, goodwill arising from past business combinations amounting to 732.3m, remains as stated under UK GAAP at 30 December 2003.
Employee benefits The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes at 30 December 2003.
The Group has recognised actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur in the statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with the amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits, issued on 16 December 2004.
Share-based payments The Group has elected to apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payment to all relevant share based payment transactions granted but not fully vested at 29 December 2004.
Financial instruments The Group has applied IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement for all periods presented and has therefore not taken advantage of the exemption in IFRS 1 that would enable the Group to only apply these standards from 28 December 2005.
General The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.

Explanation of transition to IFRSs This is the first year that the Group has presented its financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.
The following disclosures are required in the year of transition.
For the purposes of preparing this pro-forma information, the last financial statements prepared under UK GAAP were for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2003 and the date of transition to IFRS was taken to be 31 December 2003.

Explanation of transition to IFRS continued Notes to the reconciliation of equity a Software classification application software, which can be run independently from any specific hardware configuration, is typically included within other intangibles under IFRS rather than tangible assets as is the norm under UK GAAP.
The effect of this is to reclassify software of 14.8m 30 December 2003 2.8m from tangible assets to intangible assets.
Total net assets are not affected by this adjustment.
b Deferred tax associated with pension liabilities under IFRS deferred tax relating to the pension scheme cannot be netted off against the pension liability as it is under UK GAAP.
This has the effect of increasing the Groups deferred tax asset by 16.5m 30 December 2003 13.6m with a consequent increase in the net pension liability presented.
Net assets are not affected by this adjustment.
c Deferred tax on rolled over gains under IFRS deferred tax on rolled over capital gains must be provided for, while under UK GAAP this is not necessary if the intention is to retain for the foreseeable future the assets into which the capital gains have been rolled.
The effect of this is an increase of 1.5m 30 December 2003 0.7m in recognised deferred tax liabilities.
In addition, due to more restrictive rules on the ability to offset deferred tax liabilities and assets, the deferred tax liabilities and assets are grossed up by 1.3m 30 December 2003 0.6m.
d Financial instruments all derivative instruments are required by IFRS to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value.
Under IFRS, hedge accounting for derivatives is only allowed where detailed documentation in accordance with IAS 39 is in place.
This allows the movements in fair values of the relevant derivative instrument but not the related borrowings to be recognised directly in reserves and therefore not impact earnings.
This issue will have no impact on the Groups earnings as acceptable hedge accounting documentation has been in place since 30 December 2003.
However the balance sheet does reflect a financial liability of 2.5m 30 December 2003 4.8m representing the fair value of the relevant derivatives, as well as a related deferred tax asset of 0.8m 30 December 2003 1.4m offset by corresponding entries in a new hedging reserve.
e Dividends under IFRS dividends payable may only be recorded as a liability of the Group when a legal or constructive liability has been incurred.
This is likely to be when the dividend proposed by the Board is made public on the announcement of the Groups results.
Currently under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the period to which they relate, even if only proposed after the period end.
This has the effect of increasing the net assets of the Group by the amount of the proposed dividend of 43.1m 30 December 2003 37.6m.
f Holiday pay it is accepted practice under IFRS to provide for pay for holidays to which staff are entitled but which they have not yet taken.
This has resulted in the recognition of an accrual for holiday pay of 1.5m 30 December 2003 1.5m.
g Pensions a small difference arises in the valuation of the pension scheme assets under IFRS, because pension assets must be valued using bid prices rather than using mid-market prices as is the convention under UK GAAP.
This results in an increase in the pension scheme liability of 0.3m 30 December 2003 0.3m and a consequent adjustment to deferred tax assets of 0.1m 30 December 2003 0.1m.
h Acquisitions the Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the 30 December 2003.
The Group has adopted IFRS 3 Business combinations in full for the 52 weeks ended 28 December 2004.
This has resulted in the recognition of additional intangible fixed assets of 3.9m and related deferred tax liabilities of 1.0m.
Under UK GAAP the intangible fixed assets would have been recognised in goodwill and the deferred tax liability would not have arisen.
i Deferred tax assets have been reduced by 0.6m to reflect the reduced charge for share remuneration see IFRS income statement reconciliation.

In addition the costs of SAYE schemes are chargeable under IFRS whereas they are not chargeable under UK GAAP, and the IFRS transitional arrangements mean that options granted before 7 November 2002 do not attract a charge under IFRS although they were chargeable under UK GAAP.
The overall effect of these differences is a charge under IFRS that is 2.0m less in comparison with that reported under UK GAAP.
b Associate profit under IFRS, the share of the associates result included in the Groups operating profit is after a charge for interest and tax.
These items were shown within the Groups interest and tax charges under UK GAAP.
This has the effect of reducing operating profit by 1.0m, representing the tax charge of the associate.
