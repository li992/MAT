Notes to the Accounts 1 Accounting policies a Basis of preparation The accounts are prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting, modified to include the revaluation of investment properties and fixed asset investments.
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and with the Statement of Recommended Practice Financial Statements of Investment Trust Companies the SORP revised January 2003.
All of the Groups operations are of a continuing nature.
b Basis of consolidation The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings to 31 March 2004.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing 20% or more of the voting rights and over which it exerts significant influence, are treated as associated undertakings.
The Group accounts include the appropriate share of the results and reserves of these undertakings based on the latest available accounts.
Other undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing 20% or more of the voting rights but where the directors consider that the Group does not exert significant influence, are not treated as associated undertakings and are accounted for as investments.
c Properties Properties held by subsidiary undertakings for dealing are treated as current assets and are included in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and market value.
Properties held for long term investment are treated as follows: i they are revalued six-monthly and the aggregate surplus or deficit is transferred to from non-distributable reserves: and ii no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold investment properties and leasehold investment properties where the unexpired lease term is 20 years or more.
The directors consider that this accounting policy is necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view.
Depreciation is only one of the factors reflected in the valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be separately identified or quantified.
The purchase and sale of properties is recognised to be effected on the date unconditional contracts are exchanged.
d Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are valued at middle market prices.
Unlisted investments are included at directors valuation, which is based on current market prices, trading conditions and the general economic climate.
Where no active market exists for shares listed on inactive exchanges the directors valuation policy is used.
The Companys investments in subsidiary undertakings are revalued annually to the Companys share of the net assets of those undertakings.
e Capital gains and losses Realised and unrealised capital gains and losses on investments, together with exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities, are dealt with in the non-distributable reserves.
TR Property Investment Trust 33 Notes to the Accounts continued f Income Dividend income from equity shares is recognised on an ex-dividend basis and income from fixed interest debt securities and preference shares is recognised on a time apportionment basis and, if material, so as to reflect the effective yield on each such security.
Interest receivable is accounted for on an accruals basis.
g Expenses and interest payable On the basis of the Boards expected long-term split of returns in the form of capital gains and income in equal proportions, the Group charges 50% of its interest payable to capital.
One third of the management fees are deemed to relate to the administration of the Trust and are charged to revenue.
The remainder are split on the same basis as interest and 50% charged to capital.
The overall result is that two thirds of management fees are charged to revenue and one third to capital.
All performance fees are charged to capital.
The finance cost in respect of capital instruments other than equity shares is calculated so as to give a constant rate of return on the outstanding balance.
h Foreign currency Transactions denominated in overseas currencies during the year are translated into sterling at the appropriate daily exchange rate.
Assets and liabilities denominated in overseas currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the exchange rates ruling at that time.
i Taxation These accounts follow the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard FRS 16, Current Taxation, to show franked investment income net of the related tax credits.
The tax effect of different items of expenditure is allocated between capital and revenue using the Groups effective rate of tax for the year.
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Following the introduction of FRS 19, deferred taxation is provided using the liability method on all timing differences, calculated at the rate at which it is anticipated the timing differences will reverse.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only when, on the basis of available evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be taxable profits in the future against which the deferred tax asset can be offset.

These expenses will only be utilised if the Group has profits chargeable to corporation tax in future accounting periods.
It is considered too uncertain that the Group will generate such profits and, on this basis, the deferred tax asset in respect of these expenses has not been recognised.
Due to the Companys status as an Investment Trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
c Provision for deferred taxation The amounts of deferred taxation provided at 30% comprise: 2004 2003 000 000 Accelerated capital allowances 159 155 Unutilised losses carried forward 50 109 155 The movement in provision in the year is as follows: 000 Provision at the start of the year 155 Deferred tax charge in Statement of Total Return: Accelerated capital allowances 4 Unutilised losses carried forward 50 Provision at the end of the year 109 TR Property Investment Trust 37 Notes to the Accounts continued 10 Return per ordinary share Basic revenue return per ordinary share is based on the net revenue return on ordinary activities after taxation of 9,764,000 2003: 9,734,000 and on the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, being 388,831,553 2003: 422,633,986.
Basic capital return per ordinary share is based on net capital gains of 143,729,000 2003: 37,106,000 losses and on the same weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.

The Group has little exposure to credit and cash flow risk.
Unquoted investments in the portfolio are subject to liquidity risk.
This risk is taken into account by the directors when arriving at their valuation of these items.
The principal risks the Group faces in its portfolio management activities are: market price risk i. e. movements in the value of investment holdings caused by factors other than interest rate or currency movement : foreign currency risk: interest rate risk.
The Investment Managers policies for managing these risks are summarised below and have been applied throughout the year.
i Market Price Risk By the very nature of its activities, the Groups investments are exposed to market price fluctuations.
Further information on the investment portfolio and investment policy is set out in the Managers Report on pages 8 to 15. ii Foreign Currency Risk A proportion of the Groups portfolio is invested in overseas securities and their sterling value can be significantly affected by movements in foreign exchange rates.
The Group may hedge foreign currency movements outside the Eurozone by funding investments in overseas securities with unsecured loans denominated in the same currency.
iii Interest Rate Risk The majority of the Groups borrowings are at a fixed rate.
A proportion of term loans may be hedged by the use of interest rate swaps and cap contracts.
Short term borrowings are not hedged.
iv Use of Derivatives It is not the Groups policy to enter into derivative contracts other than for the purposes of hedging against price movements in the value of particular constituents of the portfolio or interest rate exposures.
