The F&C Asset Management plc Pension Schemes Following the merger of ISIS and F&C the enlarged F&C Group operates two core dened benefit pension schemes in the United Kingdom.
Both of these scheme are closed to new entrants.
All new UK F&C employees are eligible to benefit from dened contribution arrangements.
The Chairman of F&C Asset Management, Mr. R. W. Jenkins, was awarded pension benets by F&C Management Limited prior to completion of the merger between ISIS and F&C in respect of his past service to the F&C Group.
This is an unfunded pensions liability and therefore the F&C Group has made an appropriate provision in its accounts.
Employees of F&C in the Netherlands, Portugal and Ireland participate in multi-employer pension arrangements and, with the exception of Ireland, these schemes are open to new employees.
Plans are currently being initiated to set up separate dened benefit pension schemes in respect of employees in the Netherlands and Ireland.
These new arrangements will maintain the existing benets of current employees and will be funded by the transfer of assets from the current multi-employer schemes.
Where F&C Asset Management is unable to separately identify its share of assets and liabilities of overseas multi-employer dened benefit schemes, then these schemes are accounted for as dened contribution arrangements.
The details of the individual schemes in summary are as follows: F&C Netherlands B. V. Employees in the Netherlands participate in the Achmea Pension Plan.
At the end of 2004 the plan had a deficit of c349m.
F&C Netherlands BV contributed c0.3m to the Achmea Pension Plan for the period 11 October 2004 to 31 December 2004.
80 Friends Provident Notes to the Accounts continued 10.
Staff pension schemes continued F&C Ireland Limited Certain staff in Ireland participate in the Friends First Retirement and Death Benets Plan.
At the end of 2004 the plan had a deficit of c4.9m.
F&C Ireland Limited contributed c0.03m to the Friends First Plan for the period 11 October 2004 to 31 December 2004.
Certain staff in Portugal participate in the Fundo fide Penses do Grupo Banco Comercial Portugues Atlantico pension scheme.
At the end of 2004 the plan had a deficit of c1.38m.
F&C Portugal S. A. contributed c0.06m to this scheme for the period 11 October 2004 to 31 December 2004.
As a result of the merger of ISIS and F&C, F&C employees in the Netherlands and Ireland will no longer be able to continue to participate in the existing multi-employer plans.
It is expected that new pension arrangements will be set up in Ireland and the Netherlands during 2005.
When these new schemes are set up there will be a greater certainty in respect of the surpluses or deficits in these schemes attributable to the F&C Group.
Under the terms of the merger of F&C and ISIS, F&C Asset Management has a contractual protection such that the maximum pension deficit it could inherit upon the set-up of the above plans is c0.5m.
i. Summarised F&C Group Position on Dened benefit Obligations The following section provides summary analysis of all F&C dened benefit schemes which have been accounted for under FRS 17.
Further details on individual schemes can be obtained from Note 28 of F&C Asset Management plcs Report and Accounts.

These shares had a fair value of 187m resulting in a share premium of 176m.
The market price at issue was 1.65. i The share placing on 2 July 2004 raised net proceeds of 229m.
This sum was used to fund an initial payment of 250m in respect of the acquisition of F&C.
The shares were issued at 1.35 each, which was the market price.
ii Following demutualisation in 2001, share and cash entitlements that were not claimed were placed into two trusts.
On 9 July 2004 the trusts were wound up and 61.4m shares and 25m cash were transferred to the Company in exchange for it accepting liability for any future claims in respect of demutualisation entitlements which must be made by 9 July 2013 and a commitment to endow the Friends Provident Foundation, a registered charity, with cash or shares to a value of 20m.
The Company has set up a provision of 10m, based on a best estimate, in respect of possible future claims from policyholders which will only be paid out in cash.
To satisfy the commitment to the Charitable Trust, 14.9m shares with a fair value of 20m 1.35 a share were transferred to the Friends Provident Foundation.
The combined effect of these transactions resulted in an increase in the share premium of 15m.
The remaining 46.5m shares were designated as Treasury shares.
These shares do not carry any voting rights or entitlement to dividends and are available for use to settle liabilities in respect of share options for employee share schemes, at which point they are redesignated as ordinary shares.
iii The allotment of 92.4m shares on 11 October 2004 represents the balance of consideration in respect of the acquisition of F&C.
The shares had a fair value of 133m.
The shares were allocated at the market price of 1.44 each.

Therefore, in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 Section 275, certain losses on xed assets have been treated as unrealised losses.
In order to reect this, a transfer of 31m has been made to the profit and loss account from the revaluation reserve.
In 2003 a transfer of 76m was made to the revaluation reserve from the profit and loss account.

The Bonds were guaranteed on a subordinated basis by FPLO after the claims of FPLOs senior creditors, including all policyholder liabilities.
On 9 July 2001, under the demutualisation scheme, Friends Provident Life and Pensions Limited FPLP replaced FPLO as the guarantor.
The market value of the bonds at 31 December 2004 was 229m 2003: 232m.
ii On 21 November 2003, the Company issued 300m Step-up Tier One Insurance Capital Securities STICS which will bear interest from 21 November 2003 to 20 November 2019 at a rate of 6.875%.
The STICS have no maturity date but will be redeemable at the option of the Company on the 21 November 2019 and thereafter on the coupon payment date falling on or nearest to the successive fifth anniversaries of this date.
The STICS are perpetual securities and are not redeemable at the option of the Holders at any time.
The STICS are irrevocably guaranteed on a subordinated basis by FPLP.
The guarantee is intended to provide Holders with rights against FPLP in respect of the guaranteed payments which are as nearly as possible equivalent to those which they would have had if the STICS had been directly issued preference shares of FPLP.
The STICS are carried at 297m being the 300m less capitalised issue costs of 3m.
Interest is payable on the bonds in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on 21 May and 21 November in each year.
The market value of the STICS at 31 December 2004 amounted to 327m 2003: 313m.

Long-term business provision The long-term business provision is calculated on the basis of recognised actuarial methods with due regard to actuarial principles and best practice.
The methodology takes into account risks and uncertainties of the particular classes of long-term business written and the results are certied by the professionals undertaking the valuations.
Calculations are made on an individual policy basis, however where any global provisions are made these are calculated using statistical or mathematical methods.
These results are expected to be approximately the same as if an individual liability was calculated for each long-term contract.
There is inherent uncertainty in estimating all technical provisions but notably in respect of Guaranteed Annuity Options, where the option will only be of value to the policyholder depending on the economic and assumed future mortality experience at the time of retirement.
The key area of uncertainty is interest rates.
Where these are high at the time of retirement then market annuity rates will mean the value of the guarantee is reduced.
Similarly, low interest rates will increase the value of the guarantee.
Lesser areas of uncertainty relate to assumed mortality at the time of retirement and take up rates for tax free cash.
Improving mortality experience increases the value of the guarantees while increasing take up of the tax-free cash option reduces the value of the guarantees since no cost arises in respect of those funds taken as tax-free cash.
The provision for Guaranteed Annuity Options was estimated using a deterministic scenario based on prudent assumptions and the resulting provision is signicantly higher than that determined for the realistic balance sheet on a stochastic basis.
The long-term business provision is sensitive to the principal assumptions in respect of interest rates and mortality, although the relative sensitivity will vary depending on the class of long-term business.
92 Friends Provident Notes to the Accounts continued 26.
Long-term business provision continued The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the long-term business provision are set out below: Valuation interest rates 31 Dec 2004 31 Dec 2003 %% Class of Business Life Fund: Conventional With profit 3.2 3.2 Unitised With profit 3.2 3.2 Unit-linked 3.1 3.3 Term assurance 3.1 3.3 Income protection 3.9 4.2 Pension business and annuity funds: With profit deferred annuities for the self-employed 4.2 4.4 Deferred annuity under pension schemes: With profit main series 4.0 4.1 With profit UK Provident series 4.3 4.4 Unitised With profit 4.0 4.1 Annuities in payment 4.5 4.7 Valuation interest rates have generally reduced over the year reecting increased yields on underlying assets backing the liabilities.
The changes in principal assumptions can be derived from the table above.
The long-term business provision is sensitive to the change in interest rates, falling as interest rates rise and rising as interest rates fall.
The underlying assets are similarly sensitive and so the overall impact of any change is minimised.
The exception is for with profit benets where part of the underlying assets is invested in equities.
These have increased in value over the year, independent of the movement in interest rates, causing an increase in the Fund for Future Appropriations.
For Conventional With profits business reserves are calculated by carrying out cash ow projections on appropriate bases.
These cash ow projections include allowance for future expenses, but exclude explicit allowance for future bonuses.
The provision for linked contracts is equal to the value of units.
A non-unit liability, consisting mainly of sterling reserves, calculated by carrying out cash ow projections on appropriate bases, including allowance for future expenses, is included within The long-term business provision.
The non-unit liability makes prudent allowance for the cessation of premiums where such cessation would require an increased reserve.
Accumulating With profits business main series with profits deferred annuities and unitised with profits business is valued in a similar way to linked business and includes an allowance for surrender values.
The total cost of regular, interim and final bonuses attributable for the period ended 31 December 2004 was 244m 2003: 345m.
Cashable deferred annuities are valued at the greater of the value of the cash option or the annuity discounted at a rate based on the gilt futures curve 2003: 4.5% per annum in payment.
The interest rate underlying the calculation has been determined by reference to a portfolio of assets where the future cash ows match those arising from the guaranteed annuities.
Where a guaranteed annuity option is more valuable than the cash equivalent, it is assumed that 5% to 44% 2003:15% to 23% of the benefit is taken as tax-free cash, these rates being based on, but prudently below, recent experience.
Single premium income protection contracts have been valued as 90% of the last three years premiums plus an allowance for outstanding claims in respect of earlier premiums.

iii Plus additional 0.25% per annum and 0.5% per annum for individuals and group males only respectively from the valuation date onwards.
Income protection sickness rates are based on recent experience with a 10% margin for recoveries and a 16% margin for inceptions.
Rates differentiate by smoker status.
A 10% change in the inception rate changes reserves for in-force policies by the same amount.
The impact overall on the long-term business provision of a 10% change in the inception rate is 0.3%, reecting the relative size of income protection reserves to the total reserves.

Provisions for other risks and charges continued i The Group holds leases for a number of vacant and sub-let properties previously occupied by the Group.
Provision has been made for the residual lease commitments and for other outgoings where significant, after taking account of existing and expected sub-tenant arrangements.
The remaining terms of the leases are up to 12 years.
Assumptions as to whether each leasehold property may be sub-let or assigned in the future have been made.
The discount rate applied to expected future cash ows is 5%.
ii Provision has been made for complaints received by the Group, together with an estimate of complaints not yet received, in respect of the suitability of past sales of mortgage endowment policies.
The provision is based on the estimated likely cost of settling such complaints, based on recent Group and industry experience.
In addition to the accounting provision of 64m above, an actuarial reserve of 64m was held in the long-term business provision at 31 December 2004 in respect of endowment complaints see note 37. iii A review of some past sales by our direct sales force is being undertaken.
A provision of 22m has been established to cover the expected costs of redress, including administrative costs, arising from this review.
The provision has been established mainly in respect of inheritance tax planning policies see note 37. iv The Company provision of 17m includes 10m in respect of expected future claims on share entitlements not claimed following demutualisation see note 21b.
This provision also includes 7m in respect of losses in subsidiary undertakings.
Debenture loans 2004 2003 m m Floating rate secured notes i 377 Loan notes ii 8 10 Other debenture loan iii 51 385 61 i On 16 December 2004 Friends Provident Life and Pensions Limited FPLP raised 380m of core regulatory capital in the form of Floating Rate Secured Notes through a securitisation of the cash ows expected to emerge from a book of life insurance policies.
The total cost of funds is approximately 5.5% per annum.
The first repayment of principal on the notes is due on 15 April 2006 and every year thereafter, dependent on the surplus emerging from the book of life insurance policies.
For the purposes of the securitisation, two special purpose vehicles were established, namely Box Hill Life Finance plc and Box Hill Loan Finance Limited.
Both companies have been treated as Group companies for the purposes of the consolidated accounts.
On 16 December 2004 Box Hill Life Finance plc issued two classes of Floating Rate Secured Notes totalling 380m.
These were 280m Class A-1 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 15 April 2016 and 100m Class A-2 Floating Rate Secured Notes due 15 April 2019.
The Notes benefit from a financial guarantee provided by Ambac Assurance UK.
The Notes bear interest at a variable rate of 0.2% and 0.23% respectively above the 3 month London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR.
The Floating Rate Secured Notes are carried at 377m being the 380m less capitalised issue costs of 3m.
Interest is payable quarterly in arrears on 15 January, 15 April, 15 July and 15 October in each year.
Box Hill Life Finance plc and Box Hill Life Finance Limited have been treated as quasi-subsidiaries under Financial Reporting Standard 5.
The combined income, expenses and cashows of these companies are immaterial to the Group.
The summarised combined balance sheet at 31 December 2004 is set out below: 2004 m Investments 14 Current assets amounts due from group undertakings 382 Current liabilities amounts due to group undertakings 16 Net current assets 366 Total assets less current liabilities 380 Creditors due after more than one year Floating Rate Secured Note 380 Net assets Capital and reserves ii The Loan Notes issued by FP Business Holdings Limited were transferred on 13 April 2004 to Friends Provident Investment Holdings plc FPIH.

The Loan Notes are repayable at par in the year 2006 and may be redeemed at the holders request on set dates in any year until 2006.
FPIH may redeem the Loan Notes if 75% or more of the Loan Notes have been redeemed.
As at 31 December 2004 76% of the Loan Notes had been redeemed.
The Loan Notes bear interest at a variable rate of 0.5% below London Inter Bank Offer Rate LIBOR.

Convertible bonds On 11 December 2002, the Company issued 290m 5.25% convertible bonds due 2007 which are convertible at the option of the holder to ordinary shares at any time on or after 21 January 2003 and up to 5 December 2007.
The number of ordinary shares to be issued on conversion will be determined by dividing the principal amount of the relevant bonds by the conversion price in effect on the relevant conversion date.
The initial conversion price is 1.71 per ordinary share.
Unless previously purchased and cancelled, redeemed or converted, the bonds will be redeemed on 11 December 2007 at their principal amount.
The Company may, at its option, redeem all but not some of the bonds outstanding at any time on or after 27 December 2005 and up to the final maturity date of 11 December 2007 if certain conditions are met.
The Company may deliver a cash amount as an alternative to issuing ordinary shares upon either conversion or redemption.
The convertible bonds are carried at 286m being 290m less capitalised issue costs of 4m.
Interest is payable on the bonds in equal instalments semi-annually in arrears on 11 June and 11 December in each year.

Non-cash transactions The acquisition of F&C Group Holdings Limited was partly funded by the issue of shares see note 34.

Acquisition On 11 October 2004 the Company acquired, through ISIS Asset Management plc ISIS, its principal Asset Management subsidiary, F&C Group Holdings Limited F&C and its subsidiaries F&C Group from Eureko B. V. for a consideration of 456m.
The F&C Group is predominantly a European-wide asset management business.
The business combination is being accounted for as an acquisition.
On the completion date of 11 October 2004, ISIS was re-named F&C Asset Management plc.
i Consideration The consideration was satisfied by cash of 250m and the issue of 92.4 million shares in the Company to Eureko B. V. at a fair value of 133m.
The Companys interest in the ordinary shares of ISIS fell from 67% to 51% following the issue of 331 million new ordinary shares by ISIS, 145 million of which were issued to the Company.
The remainder of these shares were issued to Eureko B. V. and F&C management.
This gives rise to a deemed disposal of a stake in ISIS by the Company for which the consideration was 55m, calculated as the fair value of the holding deemed to have been disposed of.
A profit of 47m arose on the deemed disposal.
Under the terms of the sale and purchase agreement, F&C Asset Management plc is entitled to receive net assets of at least 66m.
However, an estimated 16m in further consideration is outstanding on the acquisition as the provisional fair value of the net assets acquired is 81m.
The consideration paid by the Company includes its share of the further consideration accrued.
The final consideration settlement will be paid following agreement of the completion accounts.
Acquisition costs include the Companys share of 13m of expenses incurred by ISIS in connection with the acquisition and the Companys own costs of 3m.
Prior to completion the Company subscribed to 0.4m of new preference shares, enabling the Company to maintain its existing proportionate holding of the nominal share capital in ISIS following completion.

The directors of F&C consider the fair values of the net assets to be provisional until the F&C Group completion accounts review process has been completed.
In the meantime, the adjustments reect the directors best estimates of fair value adjustments to the net assets of the acquired companies.
Annual Report & Accounts 2004 99 Notes to the Accounts continued 34.
Acquisition continued iii The following specic adjustments have been made to reect the fair value of assets acquired on acquisition: a The dened benefit pension liabilities of the F&C Group have been adjusted to reect the market value at completion.
b The fair values of the dened benefit pension liabilities have been amended to reect the FRS17 assumptions adopted by the group.
c Debtors have been reduced to their estimated realisable value to reect that doubt exists as to the recoverability of certain balances.
d The increase in creditors reects obligations of the acquired entities which are considered to exist as at 11 October 2004, but which are not reected in the completion accounts.
e Taxation adjustments have been made to the balances on acquisition to reect the taxation effect of the non-technical fair value adjustments.
iv Since the date of acquisition, operating exceptional costs of 18m have been incurred in integrating, rationalising and reorganising the business.
Provision for pension transfers and opt-outs In accordance with guidance issued by the Financial Services Authority FSA and the Personal Investment Authority, FPLP, Friends Provident Life Assurance Limited and Friends Provident Pensions Limited have reviewed the appropriateness of advice given to policyholders who effected personal pension contracts after 1988.
These reviews have now been substantially completed.
A provision of 13m 2003: 27m remains within the long-term business provision in respect of outstanding redress and associated costs.
During 2004, 13m of the provision has been released, which together with recoveries of 3m has been credited to operating exceptional items see note 8iii.
Capital expenditure for which provision has not been made in the financial statements of the Group is estimated as follows Company: Nil : Property Other Property Other 2004 2004 2003 2003 m m m m Contracted for 35.9 0.3 0.5 0.6 b.
The Group had annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases for which no provision had been made in the financial statements, as follows Company: Nil : Land and Land and buildings Other buildings Other 2004 2004 2003 2003 m m m m Operating leases which expire: within one year 1.7 2.6 1.1 2.5 in the second to fifth years inclusive 0.9 0.3 0.7 after five years 13.0 8.2 15.6 2.9 10.0 2.5 c. Obligations under finance leases for the Group fall due Company: Nil : 2004 2003 m m within one year 0.1 in the second to fifth years inclusive 0.5 Commitments under non-cancellable leases represent 0.1m of obligations under finance leases.

Contingent liabilities Past sales During 2004 there has been a considerable increase in the number of complaints received by the industry in respect of endowment policies.
All such complaints received by the Group, and an estimate of complaints not yet received, have been provided for at the latest estimate of the likely costs of settling such complaints.
In addition, a provision has been established for potential liabilities in respect of inheritance tax planning policies.
Future regulatory actions or statements could change the estimated costs.
The impact of such potential future actions cannot be estimated with reliability see note 27.
The FSA and other regulatory bodies may wish, in future, to examine the suitability of past sales of other products which could affect Friends Provident and the industry in general.
The directors of FPLP also conduct ongoing reviews of such products.
As a result, it is possible that additional unprovided liabilities could arise.
Provisions for liabilities in connection with policyholder contracts are based on best estimate assumptions, using historical experience but adjusted where there is reasonable cause to expect future experience to be different.
However, actual experience may differ from that assumed.
Regulatory action, legal judgments, future economic conditions or other unforeseen events may impact ultimate settlements made.
VAT In a current UK VAT Tribunal appeal, a UK investment trust is seeking to establish that management services to UK investment trusts should be a VAT exempt supply, rather than a taxable supply in accordance with current UK VAT law.
If this appeal were successful at the higher UK or European courts, a number of group companies, in common with other relevant fund managers in the UK, would face claims from those investment trusts to which they have supplied services for repayment of the VAT they have charged to them.
At present, the directors of F&C Asset Management plc are not able to judge the likelihood that the VAT Tribunal appeal will be successful, nor are they able to quantify the claims that may be received or the extent to which such claims could be mitigated and therefore are not able to quantify the potential liability.
F&C acquisition In December 2000, when Eureko B. V. acquired F&C Group Holdings Limited, approximately 73 per cent of the ordinary issued shares of F&C Group Management Limited, a subsidiary company, was held in the form of two bearer share warrants which could not be located prior to the completion of the sale.
Eureko B. V. was indemnified by F&C Group Holdings Limited against any losses suffered as a result of the loss of the old share warrants or the issue of replacement share warrants.
Since a bearer share warrant issued by a company entitles the bearer to the shares specified in the share warrant, there is a risk that a third party holding the old share warrants may claim that it is entitled to the specified shares in F&C Group Management Limited.
If a third party were successful in establishing a claim in relation to the old share warrants, F&C Group Holdings Limited could be liable to indemnify F&C Group Management Limited under the original indemnity arrangements, which could, as set out below, have a material adverse effect on the F&C Asset Management Groups business, results of operations and or financial condition.
Although there is a possibility that a third party may seek to establish that it is entitled to the shares specified in the old share warrants, the directors of F&C Asset Management plc have been informed that Eureko B. V. has been advised that the prospect of a third party succeeding in such a claim is remote.
Under the terms of the 2004 merger between ISIS and F&C, Eureko Holdings has given a specic indemnity guaranteed by Eureko B.

Post balance sheet event The Company acquired Lombard International Assurance S. A. Lombard on 11 January 2005.
Consideration structure The consideration structure comprises a c265m 187m initial payment, funded through a new issue of FP shares to Lombard shareholders.
Subsequent payments are variable based on Lombards performance earn-out payments.
This structure is designed to achieve an aggregate payment which fairly reects the longer term performance of Lombard, while providing an incentive for Lombards management team to continue the business strong growth.
Under a reasonable range of performance scenarios, the implied multiple of achieved operating profit after tax that FP would pay, in aggregate consideration, is approximately six times.
The earn-out payments that are payable in respect of each of 2004, 2005 and 2006 are dependent on Lombard achieving certain performance thresholds for both new business profits and underlying embedded value.
Earn-out payments will be paid in cash or FP shares, at FPs option.
The payments to be made in respect of 2004 and 2005 will be capped at c90m 62m and c85m 59m respectively with any excess combined with the final potential payment in respect of the 2006 year.
The table below illustrates the schedule of payments to Lombard under two scenarios over the earn-out period: a average compound growth rate ACGR in new business profits of 5% and b ACGR in new business profits of 25%.
a b New business profits ACGR 2003-2006 cmm cmm Initial payment 265 187 265 187 2004 earn-out payment 33 23 80 55 2005 earn-out payment 15 10 74 51 2006 earn-out payment 71 49 Total consideration 313 220 490 342 The total consideration will be capped at the lowest of: i c600m 414m : ii 1.4 times 2006 year-end embedded value: and iii the aggregate of 2006 year-end embedded value and 2.0 times 2006 new business profits after tax and solvency margin.
104 Friends Provident Notes to the Accounts continued 40.
Post balance sheet event continued All the earn-out payments will be calculated using a xed set of economic assumptions such that the consideration structure is dependent principally on Lombards operating performance.
The initial payment sterling equivalent was determined from actual currency translation values.
All other amounts in sterling are translated at euro sterling rate of 1.45 for illustrative purposes.
Management and integration Lombard will continue to be run by its current management team and continue to be incentivised through its own executive share incentive plan.
