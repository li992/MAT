Notes to the accounts 1 Financial restructuring On 19 May 2003, the financial restructuring of the Group was completed and the Schemes of Arrangement for Marconi Corporation plc the Company and M 2003 plc became effective.
As a result of the Companys Scheme of Arrangement specific borrowings and creditors amounting to 4,816 million were cancelled, comprising bank loans 2.1 billion, bonds and balances with Ancrane Ltd, a subsidiary of M 2003 plc 2.5 billion, accrued interest 113 million and other creditors 13 million.
In consideration for the cancelled claims, we paid 340 million of cash, issued new Notes of 756 million and issued 1 billion of new shares with a nominal value of 5p per share or 50 million in total.
Share premium of 3,670 million arose on the issue of the new shares representing the difference between the balances schemed and the consideration.
In addition to the cancellation of these balances, a surplus of 2 million was recorded in the profit and loss account, comprising capitalised net losses on interest rate swaps hedging the debt previously unwound in prior years and now written off 46 million see note 7, a balance waived by a subsidiary of M 2003 plc in favour of Marconi Corporation plc 25 million see note 5e, the release of certain tax provisions no longer required 20 million see note 8 and accrued interest no longer payable 3 million see note 6.
In addition, a foreign exchange gain of 8 million arose between 31 March 2003 and the date on which the balances were schemed.
On 19 May 2003, the ESOP derivative banks settlement became effective and 35 million was paid to the ESOP derivative banks see note 5f.
On 21 May 2003, a capital reduction occurred which reduced share premium to nil and credited other reserves see note 22.
2 Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards in the UK.
The more important Marconi Corporation Group accounting policies are summarised below to facilitate the interpretation of the financial statements.
Further details on the application of critical accounting policies are set out in the Operating and financial review on pages 6 to 21.
Accounting convention The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of listed current and fixed asset investments.
Basis of consolidation The financial statements consolidate the accounts of Marconi Corporation plc and all of its subsidiary undertakings Group companies or subsidiaries.
All inter-company balances and transactions have been eliminated upon consolidation.
All Group companies accounts have been prepared for the year ended 31 March 2004.
Turnover Turnover excludes VAT and comprises sales to outside customers.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred or service has been rendered, customer acceptance has occurred, Marconis price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured.
Revenue from services is recognised at the time of performance and acceptance by the customer.
Revenue from multiple element contracts is allocated based on the fair value of each individual element.
Revenue on long-term contracts is recognised under the  method of accounting and is calculated based on the ratio of costs incurred to date compared with the total expected costs for that contract.
Currency translation Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into the functional currency at the rates at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account with the exception of certain gains and losses arising under hedging transactions as described below.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures, and associates and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Non-sterling net assets are translated at year end rates of exchange.
Key rates used are as follows: Average rates Year end rates 2004 2003 2004 2003 US Dollar 1.7023 1.5538 1.8379 1.5807 Euro 1.4435 1.5499 1.4956 1.4486 The differences arising from the restatement of profits and losses and the retranslation of the opening net liabilities to year-end rates are taken to reserves.
52 2 Accounting policies continued Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a business, including an interest in an associated undertaking, fair values are attributed to the Groups share of separate net assets.
Where the cost of acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to such net assets, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill capitalised in the balance sheet in the year of acquisition.
The profit or loss on the disposal or closure of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of any purchased goodwill relating to that business not previously charged to the profit and loss account.
The results and cash flows relating to a business are included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the consolidated cash flow statement from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
Financial instruments Prior to the financial restructuring, the Group has used financial instruments, including interest rate swaps, currency swaps and other derivatives, solely for the purposes of raising finance for its operations and managing interest and currency risk associated with the Groups underlying business activities.
There is no trading activity in financial instruments.
Hedges of the net investment in overseas subsidiaries The Groups policy is to finance where possible its activities in the same currencies as those used for its foreign investments in order to hedge foreign currency exposure of net investments in foreign operations.
This policy is implemented by financing in the related currency.
Exchange gains or losses arising in the hedging borrowings are dealt with as a movement in reserves, to the extent they offset losses or gains on the hedged investment.
Interest rate risk exposure Prior to the financial restructuring, it has been Group policy to hedge its exposure to movements in interest rates associated with its borrowing primarily by means of interest rate swaps.
Payments and receipts under interest rate swap agreements specifically designated for hedging purposes are recorded in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Gains and losses arising on termination of hedging instruments where the underlying exposure remains are recognised in the profit and loss account over the remaining life of the hedging instrument.
Tangible fixed assets Property, plant, machinery, fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives from the time they are brought in to use.
Freehold land does not bear depreciation where the original cost of purchase was separately identified.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated using the following rates: Freehold buildings 2% to 4% per annum Leasehold property over the period of the lease or 50 years for long leases Plant and machinery 10% per annum on average Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment 10% per annum Leased assets Assets held under finance leases and other similar contracts, which confer rights and obligations similar to those attached to owned assets, are capitalised as tangible fixed assets and are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and their useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities, while the interest elements are charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the leases to produce a constant rate of charge on the balance of the capital repayments outstanding.
Hire purchase transactions are dealt with similarly except that assets are depreciated over their useful lives.
Rentals under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Goodwill Purchased goodwill is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful economic life.
Each acquisition is separately evaluated for the purposes of determining the useful economic life, up to a maximum of 20 years.
The useful economic lives are reviewed annually and revised if necessary.
Research and development Expenditure incurred in the year is charged against profit unless specifically chargeable to and receivable from customers under agreed contract terms.
Stock Stock is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow moving or defective items where appropriate.
53 Notes to the accounts continued 2 Accounting policies continued Contracts in progress Profit on long term contracts in progress is taken when a sale is recorded on part delivery of products or part performance of services, provided that the outcome of the contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
Amounts recoverable on long term contracts, which are included in debtors, are stated at the net sales value of the work done less amounts received as progress payments on account.
Excess progress payments are included in creditors as payments received in advance.
Cumulative costs incurred net of amounts transferred to cost of sales, less provision for contingencies and anticipated future losses on contracts, are included as long term contract balances in stock.
Warranties Provisions for estimated expenses related to product warranties are made at the time products are sold.
These estimates are established using historical information on the nature, frequency, and average cost of warranty claims.
Taxation Taxation on profit on ordinary activities is that which has been paid or becomes payable in respect of the profits for the year, after taking account of adjustments in respect of prior period liabilities.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income or expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Investments Joint ventures comprise long-term investments where control is shared under a contractual arrangement.
The sector analysis of turnover, profit and net assets excludes the Groups share of the results and net assets of joint ventures.
Associates consists of long-term investments in which the Group holds a participating interest and over which it exercises significant influence.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are started at the amount of the Groups share of net assets including goodwill derived from audited or management accounts made up to the date.
Loss before taxation includes the Groups share of joint ventures and associates.
Other unlisted fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for impairment in value.
Listed fixed asset investments are stated at market value.
Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value except dated listed securities which are stated at market value.
Pensions and other post retirement benefits The operating cost for providing pensions and other post retirement benefits, as calculated periodically by independent actuaries, is charged to the Groups operating profit or loss in the year that those benefits are earned by employees.
The financial return expected on the pension schemes assets is recognised in the year in which they arise as part of finance income and the effect of the unwinding of the discounted value of the pension schemes liabilities is treated as part of finance costs.
The changes in value of the pension schemes assets and liabilities are reported as actuarial gains or losses as they arise in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The pension schemes surpluses, to the extent they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented in the balance sheet net of any related deferred tax.
Share options The costs of awarding shares under employee share plans are generally charged to the profit and loss account over the period to which the performance criteria relate.
Finance costs Finance costs of debt are recognised in the profit and loss account over the term of such instruments at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the year.
Liquid resources Liquid resources compromise term deposits with an original maturity of generally less than one year and other readily disposable current asset investments.

Separate components of goodwill are identified and amortised over the appropriate useful economic life.
The remaining goodwill on the balance sheet will be amortised over an average period of approximately five years.
It is not practical to disclose goodwill amortisation on a segmental basis as any allocation would be arbitrary.
The net assets of Network Equipment and Network Services cannot be separately identified as the same assets are, generally used to generate sales in each of these segments.
The results of these segments are separately reportable.
Central costs include 31 million of share option and related payroll costs 2003: nil.
Other consists of previous non-core businesses sold in the year ended 31 March 2004.
Certain assets and liabilities cannot be allocated.
These principally consist of taxation, retirement benefits and central provisions.
Sales by Group companies to joint ventures and associates amounted to 21 million 2003: 30 million.
Purchases from joint ventures and associates amounted to 1 million 2003: nil.
Analysis of operating loss, turnover and net assets liabilities by territory of origin The Group has historically divided its business into three segments: Network Equipment, Network Services and Other but from 1 April 2003 is adopting a new reporting structure along geographic lines.
A ring-fence around the US parent Marconi Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries was created in connection with the Scheme of Arrangement for Marconi Corporation plc effective on the 19 May 2003, we call this segment the North American Ring Fence NARF.
NARF is comprised of the US operating businesses the equipment and service activities of the Broadband Routing and Switching BBRS and Outside Plant & Power OPP irrespective of the country of destination of these sales.
In addition certain sales for products from Marconi Corporation plc and Non-NARF businesses are transacted through NARF regions where economies of scale permit the NARF to conduct the business more efficiently.
Non-NARF mainly comprises Marconi Corporation plc and our European and the Rest of the World businesses: Optical Networks, Access Networks, Other Network Equipment and Network Services and includes central costs.
Non-NARF holds the investment in Marconi Communications, Inc which eliminates on consolidation and gives rise to goodwill.
55 Notes to the accounts continued 3 Segmental analysis continued The operating profit loss, turnover and net assets for the NARF and Non-NARF segments are disclosed below with comparatives where applicable.

Exceptional items These items have been analysed as follows: a Operating exceptional items 2004 2003 million million Restructuring credits costs included in cost of sales i 9 21 Impairment of tangible fixed assets ii 36 Restructuring and reorganisation costs iii 89 277 Systems implementation costs iv 7 Increase in provision for litigation settlement v 5 Releases in respect of doubtful debts vi 4 10 Included in administrative expenses 90 296 Group operating exceptional items 81 317 Share of joint ventures operating exceptional items vii 32 Total operating exceptional items excluding associates 81 349 i In the year to 31 March 2004, 9 million was credited to restructuring costs within cost of sales.
6 million of this relates to the release of liability provisions held against the outsourcing of certain manufacturing operations to Jabil Circuit Inc due to a revision in our outsourcing plans.
3 million was received for stock, previously fully provided for through an exceptional charge, and subsequently utilised by Jabil.
In the year to 31 March 2003, 21 million was the net amount charged in relation to the Jabil outsourcing arrangement.
ii In the year to 31 March 2003, in light of declining industry and economic trends on its current and expected future operations, the Group reassessed the carrying values of goodwill and tangible fixed assets.
As a consequence tangible fixed assets were impaired by 36 million.
iii As part of the Groups cost reduction actions, a charge of 89 million 2003: 277 million was recorded during the year to 31 March 2004.
This includes 13 million for the costs of the financial restructuring, 64 million for employee severance and the balance for site rationalisation and other restructuring costs.
The site rationalisation costs reflect charges associated with the closure and consolidation of various sites around the world as part of the business restructuring.
iv During the year to 31 March 2002, the Group planned to implement a new global IT system.
In light of the then subsequent revised trading outlook and the continued focus on cost reduction, the implementation was terminated.
During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Group was able to revise its previous estimate of the overall costs leading to the release of 7 million from the amounts accrued in the year ended 31 March 2003. v In Part X, section 15.4 of our listing particulars we made disclosure of the lawsuit file by Bell Communications Research.
Inc, now known as Telcordia Technologies Inc. or Telcordia.
On 12 January 2004, we entered into a binding memorandum of understanding with Telcordia wherein we agreed to pay Telcordia $23.5 million approximately 13 million in exchange for a license to Telcordias ATM patent portfolio and as full and final settlement of all outstanding claims.
We are in the process of negotiating formal definitive agreements.
As consequence of this claim, we have reassessed our provisioning level and made an exceptional charge of 5 million to our operating results in the year ended 31 March 2004. vi In light of the declining market and economic trends the Group experienced during the year to 31 March 2002, an exceptional provision against bad and doubtful debts was charged.
Of this amount, 4 million was reassessed and released to the profit and loss account in the year to 31 March 2004.
In the year to 31 March 2003, 10 million previously provided for, was paid by the Groups debtors.
vii During the year ended 31 March 2003, the Group recorded its 32 million share of the operating exceptional charges of its joint ventures.
Of this, 31 million related to the impairment of intangible fixed assets in Ultramast Ltd. 58 5 Exceptional items continued a Operating exceptional items continued Analysis by segment 2004 2003 million million Network Equipment and Services 81 304 Other 13 Continuing Operations 81 291 Discontinued Operations 26 81 317 United Kingdom 22 21 Other EMEA 25 235 US 25 82 CALA 5 13 APAC 4 8 81 317 b Associates operating exceptional items The Group has recorded nil 2003: 25 million of the operating exceptional charges of its associates, being in respect of Easynet Group Plc.

The 77 million gain on disposal of joint ventures and associates related to the gain on disposal of Easynet 76 million and Confirmant 1 million.
The 25 million gain on disposal of fixed assets and investments in continuing operations comprised a gain on disposal of Marconi Mobile Access S. p. A. of 9 million, and other fixed asset investments of 22 million, is partially offset by a pension settlement loss of 6 million on the disposal of GDA.
In the year ended 31 March 2003, the loss on disposal of discontinued operations resulted from the sale of Strategic Communications 41 million offset by the release of provisions relating to the disposal of the Groups Systems businesses Medical, Commerce and Data Systems.
A curtailment gain of 28 million in respect of pension liabilities was recognised principally following the sale of the Groups 50% share of GDA in March 2002.
The balance mainly relates to gains on property disposals.
Merger demerger receipts of 123 million related to the release of a provision due to the settlement of the ESOP derivative.
d Amounts written off investments The change in value of the Groups investments is accounted for in line with the group accounting policy whereby listed investments are marked to their market value at the end of each reporting year and unlisted investments are held at the lower of cost and recoverable value.
e Gain loss on waiver of balance payable to M 2003 plc group As part of the restructuring, Marconi Corporation plc and its subsidiaries entered into an agreement with M 2003 plc and its direct subsidiaries to reassign and waive balances between the M 2003 plc group and the Marconi Corporation plc group.

d Factors that may affect future tax charges Deferred tax assets totalling 659 million 2003: 594 million have not been recognised in respect of operating losses, pension scheme deficits, and exceptional expenditure as the Group is not sufficiently certain that it will be able to recover those assets within a relatively short period of time.
The Group will incur ongoing tax cash costs where losses are unavailable to cover any historic tax audit adjustments and or future taxable profits.
61 Notes to the accounts continued 9 Equity minority interests Equity minority interests represent the share of profits less losses on ordinary activities attributable to the interests of equity shareholders in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned by the Group.
10 Equity dividends The directors do not propose any dividends for the year ended 31 March 2004.
No dividends were declared during the year to 31 March 2003.
11 Loss per share Basic and diluted loss per share is calculated by reference to a weighted average of 249.0 million ordinary shares 2003: 573.3 million ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The effect of share options is anti-dilutive for each year presented and has therefore been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number of shares.
An adjusted basic loss per share has been presented in order to highlight the underlying performance of the Group, and is calculated as set out in the table below.

d Share options As previously announced at the time of the financial restructuring, the Company has granted nil cost share options to its executive directors and senior managers.
In total, using numbers and prices following the 1 for 5 share consolidation, which took effect on 9 September 2003, options over 15.2 million ordinary shares were granted on 24 June 2003, with options over a further 1 million shares granted on 1 September 2003 and 1.5 million shares on 12 February 2004.
The adjusted mid market closing price of a Marconi Corporation plc share on the dates of grant were 293.75p on 24 June 2003, 455p on 1 September 2003 and 717p on 12 February 2004.
The cost of these options will be spread over the five performance periods defined in the nil cost share option plan set out in the Groups prospectus dated 31 March 2003.
The plan has five performance targets, each having a period in which the options over shares will vest.
The first four performance targets have now been met.
The overall impact on the Groups profit and loss account over the life of the Plan through to the financial year-ending 31 March 2007, assuming the final performance target is also met, will be approximately 60 million before payroll tax.
The 60 million charge is a non-cash item.
The operating loss for the year to 31 March 2004 has been charged with 25 million 2003: nil and shares to be issued in the balance sheet have been credited with 25 million.
We expect the charge to be 23 million in the year ended 31 March 2005, 9 million in the year to 31 March 2006 and 3 million in the year to 31 March 2007.
On 30 June 2003, the Company granted market value share options to employees.
In total, options over 6.3 million ordinary shares have been granted.
Under UK GAAP, the only cost of these options will be employer payroll taxes incurred when the share options vest.
The performance conditions are the same as the nil cost share option plan.
At 31 March 2003 there were no options outstanding over the Companys shares.

26 Post retirement benefits Marconi operates defined benefit pension plans in the UK, US and Europe, and post retirement medical plans in the US.
The most significant plan is The GEC 1972 Plan the UK Plan in the UK.
A full actuarial funding valuation for the UK Plan was carried out as at 5 April 2002 and a valuation for accounting purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by independent qualified actuaries.
For the US Plans, funding valuations were carried out at 1 January 2004 and independent qualified actuaries carried out a valuation for accounting purposes as at 31 March 2004.
The European plans are unfunded and valuations were carried out for accounting purposes at 31 March 2004.
The contributions made to the plans in the accounting year totalled 21 million 2003: 20 million.
For the unfunded pension plans and the post retirement medical plans, payments totalling 17 million 2003: 17 million were made when the benefits were provided.
Company contributions to the UK Plan are 8.2% of pensionable pay.
In the US, on 26 March 2003, the Group signed a funding agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC for the US defined benefit schemes.
Under this agreement, Marconi is required to contribute US$2.25 million at the end of each calendar quarter to two of its US defined benefit plans, in addition to the annual normal cost associated with the continuation of benefits.
Additionally, proceeds from any disposal of US business shall be used to fund scheme deficits.
On 20 February 2004, we disposed of our North American Access NAA business.
As a result of the disposal we contributed US$ 5.4 million to its US defined benefit plan.
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in addition to the defined benefit schemes listed.

The practice has been revised further between 31 March 2003 and 31 March 2004.
The discretionary level of credited interest has been treated as a constructive obligation.

In the year ended 31 March 2004, as actual investment returns in the UK and US plans exceeded expected investment returns following the recovery of the equity markets, resulting in substantial asset gains.
The second largest impact on the STRGL in both years has been the losses resulting from changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plans liabilities.
At 31 March 2004, due to movements in AA corporate bond rates in the UK and US, the UK discount rate was increased from 5.25% to 5.50% leading to a gain, and the US discount rate was decreased from 6.25% to 5.75% leading to a loss.
In the UK Plan, the trustees have discretion to credit interest bonuses to pension awards.
This has been reduced from 4% to 3% to align with actual expected awards providing a further gain.
Offsetting these gains in the UK, is a loss resulting from revised mortality assumptions.
An increase in life expectancy has been observed since the last funding valuation and consequently the expected terms over which the UK Plan is expected to pay pensions has been increased, resulting in a loss.

The Group is engaged in a number of legal proceedings relating to shareholder class actions, patent and other claims under contracts.
The Group is vigorously defending these cases, the estimated cost of which is disclosed above, and the directors currently believe that the claims are unlikely to be settled for amounts resulting in material cash or other asset outflows.

80 28 Financial instruments a Treasury policies and organisation The Groups treasury activities are coordinated by its treasury function which operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board.
It does not operate as a profit centre.
Treasury advises operational management on treasury matters and undertakes all derivative transactions.
All treasury related transactions undertaken by our operating businesses are required to be in accordance with guidelines laid down by our central treasury function and comply with the Group risk management policies.
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all disclosures within note 28 except the currency profile.
Financial instruments Prior to the financial restructuring, the Group used financial instruments, including derivatives principally interest rate swaps, cancellable interest rate swaps, currency swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage interest rate and currency risk exposures.
There were no such transactions outstanding during the year to 31 March 2004.
It is the Groups policy that there is no trading in financial instruments, and all financial instruments are used for the purpose of financing or hedging identified exposures of the Group.
The main risks faced by the Group in the financial markets in the years ending 31 March 2004 and 2003 were liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and counterparty risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these, which are summarised below.
Liquidity risk The Group has funded its activities through cash generated from its operational activities, the proceeds of disposals, and the Junior and Senior Notes effective 19 May 2003.
The Groups gross borrowings as at 31 March 2004 were 305 million 2003: 4,775 million and cash and liquid resources were 519 million 2003: 1,158 million.
These balances declined as a result of our financial restructuring and through a series of mandatory redemptions and market repurchases described on page 19 of the Operating and financial review.
At 31 March 2004, the Group had no material bank facilities 2003: F2.9 billion.
At 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003 all facilities were payable on demand and there were no undrawn committed borrowing facilities.
The following table sets out the breakdown of restricted and free cash balances at 31 March 2004 and 31 March 2003: 31 March 31 March 2004 2003 million million Performance bonds: Cash collateral on new performance bonding facility 35 Cash collateral on performance bonds and guarantees 50 135 Total cash collateralised against performance bonds 85 135 Captive insurance company 18 17 Collateral on secured loans 11 812 Mandatory Redemption Escrow Account MREA 10 Total restricted cash 124 964 Cash held at subsidiary level and cash in transit 74 89 Available Treasury deposits 321 105 Total cash at bank and in hand including liquid resources 519 1,158 At 31 March 2003, the majority of the Groups cash resources were held in secured accounts which were subject to interim security arrangements in favour of the Groups syndicate banks, bondholders and also to one of the ESOP Derivative Banks.
At 19 May, the date of restructuring, all restrictions upon these accounts were lifted.
The Group continues to be required to place collateral, in whole or in part, against any provision of performance bonding facilities or letters of credit.
As at 31 March 2004, 85 million of collateral was outstanding 2003: 135 million.
On release of this collateral, if the Senior Notes are still outstanding, all released amounts are paid into a Mandatory Redemption Escrow Account and used in due course to redeem the Groups Senior Notes.
81 Notes to the accounts continued 28 Financial instruments continued a Treasury policies and organisation continued Interest rate risk As part of the financial restructuring, the Group covenanted not to enter any interest rate hedging transactions.
As a result, 95% of the Groups borrowings are at fixed rates of interest 2003: 50%.
Due to the proportion of fixed rate debt, the Groups interest charge has limited exposure to interest rate movements.
Consequently an increase in market interest rates of one percentage point would have reduced loss before taxation in the year ended 31 March 2004 by approximately 7 million 2003 increased loss by 14 million.
In the year ended 31 March 2004, the average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments was approximately 2.0% per annum 2003: 2.2%.
The largest proportion of investments was in US$ deposits.
The Group held an average of $454 million in US$ deposits 2003: $788 million, earning an average interest rate of 1.0% per annum 2003: 1.6%.
Foreign exchange risk The Group is exposed to movements in foreign exchange rates against sterling for both trading transactions and the translation of net assets and the profit and loss accounts of overseas subsidiaries.
The main trading currencies of the Group are the US dollar, sterling and the euro.
Following our financial restructuring, the majority of our debt 265 million or 87% as at 31 March 2004 is denominated in US dollars.
It is our policy to take this US dollar exposure into account when determining the appropriate currency mix of the Groups cash balances.
Our cash and liquid resources were 519 million 2003: 1,158 million of which 111 million 2003: 515 million was denominated in sterling, 262 million 2003: 282 million in US dollars, 110 million 2003: 308 million in euro and the balance of 36 million 2003: 53 million in other currencies.
As at 31 March 2004, we held approximately F74 million 50 million of cash denominated in euro within the UK, as collateral against bonding facilities and to meet potential cash requirements in the euro zone.
Since this cash is designated for euro-denominated cash flow requirements, this cash is not treated as a hedge for accounting purposes, and gains and losses on retranslation of the cash into sterling are taken to net finance income expenditure.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries that earn profits or incur losses in their local currencies.
It is not the Groups policy to hedge the exposures arising from the translation of these overseas results into sterling.
Our sales and profitability are sensitive to exchange rate fluctuations, as discussed on page 8 of the Operating and financial review.
Counterparty risk All deposits are made with creditworthy and authorised counterparties.
We have not issued any new customer finance commitments during the year ended 31 March 2004, and will not require cash resources to fund these activities in the foreseeable future.
At 31 March 2004, in respect of the commitments outstanding prior to the financial year, we had customer finance commitments of approximately 26 million 2003: 42 million of which approximately 26 million 2003: 38 million had been drawn.
The reduction in the year to 31 March 2004 resulted from the repayment of an obligation to Marconi from Grande Communications Holdings, Inc.
In addition, the Group uses export credit agencies to assist in managing political and credit risks on major contracts and makes extensive use of export credit insurance in respect of small to medium-sized contracts.
Contract bonding facilities Some customers in the telecommunications market require that bank bonds or surety bonds issued by insurance companies are provided to guarantee performance of the equipment supplier.
We had a total of 141 million of bonds outstanding at 31 March 2004 with both banks and insurance companies worldwide as compared with 163 million at 31 March 2003.
Following our financial restructuring, we have a committed superpriority bonding facility for a total of 50 million of bonding, of which 18 million had been drawn and was outstanding at 31 March 2004.
The new bonding facility allows Marconi Bonding Limited, a group subsidiary, to procure a total of 50 million of performance bonding.
These bonds will be fully collateralised, with 50% of the collateral being placed at the time of issuance of the bond 10 million at 31 March 2004 and 50% being rolled over from releases of collateral on existing bonds maximum 25 million as at 31 March 2004.
All collateral relating to bonds issued on behalf of companies previously disposed by the Group has now been released.
82 28 Financial instruments continued a Treasury policies and organisation continued A maturity profile of all bonds and guarantees outstanding at 31 March 2004 is set out below: Bonds Bonds outstanding outstanding at 31 March at 31 March 2004 2003 Expiring 31 March million million 2004 or earlier 8 62 2005 43 24 2006 8 16 2007 58 35 Thereafter 17 12 No expiry date 7 14 Total 141 163 A number of our performance bond arrangements carry rights for the issuer to call for cash collateral, either unconditionally or upon the occurrence of certain events.
We estimate that as at 31 March 2004, performance bond providers had varying conditional or unconditional rights to call for cash collateral of up to 62 million in respect of wholly or partially uncollateralised bonds.
Insurance risk management The Group manages centrally the purchase of global insurance policies in respect of major insurable risks, including property material damage business interruption, directors and officers and public liability.
The Group has maintained the types of property and liabilities insurance which the directors regard as appropriate given the nature of the risks run in the course of its business, and for amounts which they consider adequate.
When considering the appropriateness of insurance cover, the directors have made detailed assessments of insurable risks using both in-house professionals and the advice of insurance brokers.
The directors have determined what they believe to be the appropriate level of cover having regard, among other things, to the Groups loss record, the industry in which it operates, its risk tolerance level, the cost of cover relative to the risk, customer and legal requirements and any relevant and available information on the levels of cover typically purchased by other comparable companies which operate in the Groups industry.
The use of global policies and centrally appointed brokers allows the Group to improve internal control and optimise the overall level of retained risk.
Risk management and insurance spend are concentrated on those insurable risks which are considered potentially catastrophic to the Group as a whole.
The Group continues to work with its insurers and advisers to improve its loss prevention and mitigation process.

The book value of the equity swap at March 2003 reflected the existing provisions in respect of the share option scheme exposures to which the swap related.
The fair value included accrued interest of 44 million which was fully provided for in the book value.
The book and fair values are net of collateral paid of 214 million.
e Gain and losses on hedges During the year to 31 March 2004, no forward foreign exchange or interest rate swap contracts were outstanding.
Therefore, there were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges during the year.
29 Post balance sheet events Following the 31 March 2004 a number of events have taken place to further reduce the amount of Senior Notes outstanding.
On 2 April 2004, we completed the repurchase of $15 million 8 million of our Senior Notes, which were transacted prior to the end of the year.
In addition on 22 April 2004, we completed the fourth partial redemption of $27 million 16 million of our Senior Notes.
Further, on 12 May 2004 we announced the cancellation of the Senior Notes previously repurchased by Marconi Corporation plc.
As a result, this further reduced the total principal amount outstanding to approximately $445 million 242 million.
On 25 March 2004, M K Atkinson was designated as the Companys Senior Independent Director.
On 6 May 2004, P C F Hickson was appointed as a non-executive director of the Company.
Continuing operations, as used in the table above, reflects the historical track record of these businesses, excluding share of joint ventures.
