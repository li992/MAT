Under US GAAP, Financial Accounting Standard FAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, prescribes the method and assumptions that may be used to calculate pension costs.
This method recognises the surplus deficit falling outside a 10% fluctuation corridor.
The supplementary disclosures required by FAS 87 and FAS 132, Employers Disclosure about Pensions and Other Post retirement Benefits are given in note 28, page 95.
The US GAAP pension costs and disclosures incorporate the requirements of FAS 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Termination Benefits.
b On 1 January 2002, BG Group adopted FAS 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.
Under UK GAAP, prior to the publication of FRS 10, Goodwill and Intangible Assets, goodwill was taken to Group reserves immediately on acquisition.
As a result of the adoption of FRS 10, goodwill is now capitalised as an intangible fixed asset and amortised.
Before the adoption of FAS 142, goodwill under US GAAP was accounted for in line with FRS 10.
Under FAS 142, goodwill is allocated to reporting units.
It is no longer amortised but is instead reviewed annually for impairment and the UK amortisation charge for the period has therefore been reversed within US net income.
On adoption in 2002, an impairment review of assets was undertaken in order to ascertain any transitional adjustment required and no adjustment was considered necessary.
c Under US GAAP, BG Group recognised goodwill relating to assets held in Argentina.
Following the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, this goodwill was reviewed and deemed irrecoverable from future cash flows.
d Under US GAAP, as permitted under FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, BG Group accounts for stock options under Accounting Principles Board statement APB 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees as clarified by Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB Interpretation No.
44, Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation FIN 44 and FIN 28, Accounting for Stock Appreciation and Other Variable Stock Option or Award Plans.
In any ten year period, not more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or issuable under all schemes.
Under UK GAAP, BG Group accrues for social security payments on share options over the vesting period.
US GAAP requires these amounts to be accounted for when paid: therefore there is a reconciling item within shareholders funds to reverse the UK GAAP accrual.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 30 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued Details of the BG Group Company Share Option Scheme CSOS are given on page 54.
In any ten year period, not more than 5% of the issued share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under discretionary share option schemes, including the CSOS.
Under UK GAAP, Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 UITF 17, there is no profit and loss account charge in respect of these options as the exercise price is the same as the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant.
Under US GAAP, variable accounting is applied to this scheme and compensation expense, recognised rateably over the vesting period, is equal to the difference between the market value of the underlying share relating to the option and the exercise price.
At each reporting period, compensation expense is adjusted for subsequent changes in the market value of the shares since the date of grant.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the CSOS is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.0% 2003 1.2%: 2002 1.2%, volatility of 22% 2003 32%: 2002 38%, risk-free rate of 4.96% 2003 4.47%: 2002 4.35% and an expected life of 5 years 2003 5 years: 2002 5 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 0.95 per share 2003 0.85 per share: 2002 0.92 per share.
Details of the BG Group Sharesave Scheme are given on page 55.
In any five year period, not more than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company may be issued or be issuable under all-employee share schemes.
Under UK GAAP, no profit and loss account charge is incurred in respect of this scheme as Save As You Earn schemes are exempt from the provisions of UITF 17.
In accordance with FIN 44, the 20% discount on the option price compared with the market price on the date of grant must be recognised as compensation expense over the saving period.
No significant compensation expense has been recognised for any of the prior periods presented.
The fair value of share options granted during the year in respect of the Sharesave Scheme is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.0% 2003 1.2%: 2002 1.2%, volatility of 22% 2003 31%: 2002 39%, a weighted average risk-free rate of 4.84% 2003 4.34%: 2002 4.42% and a weighted average expected life of 3.6 years 2003 3.8 years: 2002 3.8 years.
The average fair value of share options granted during the year was 1.17 per share 2003 0.99 per share: 2002 1.04 per share.
Details of the BG Group Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS are given on page 53.
Notional allocations of shares under the LTIS scheme are made each year to eligible employees.
Under UK GAAP, costs of this Scheme are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the allocation, based upon the likelihood of the allocation vesting under the Scheme and the fair value of shares acquired to fulfil the allocation.
Under US GAAP, the profit and loss account charge is based upon the likelihood of the allocation vesting under the Scheme and the current market value of the shares required to fulfil the allocation.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year in respect of the LTIS is estimated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the 104 following assumptions: dividend yield of 1.0% 2003 1.2%: 2002 1.2%, volatility of 22% 2003 32%: 2002 38%, a risk-free rate of 4.87% 2003 4.32%: 2002 4.18% and an expected life of 3 years 2003 3 years: 2002 3 years.
The fair value includes an allowance in respect of market performance conditions.
The fair value of shares allocated during the year was 1.70 per share 2003 1.30 per share: 2002 1.22 per share.
Details of the BG Group Share Incentive Plan SIP are given on page 54.
Free Shares awards were made under the SIP in 2004 and 2003.
Under both UK GAAP and US GAAP, the charge to the profit and loss account in respect of the award is based on the market value of the shares at the date of the allocation.
The fair value of the shares awarded during the year was 3.32 per share 2003 2.51 per share: 2002 3.05 per share.
The following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the Company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of FAS 123 to stock-based employee compensation: for the year ended 31 December 2004 2003 2002 m m m Net income as reported 731 766 393 Add: charges to net income under APB 25 net of tax 19 86 Deduct: charges determined under the fair value basis of FAS 123 net of tax 12 12 9 Pro-forma net income 738 762390 Earnings per ADS as reported: Basic 1.03 1.09 0.56 Diluted 1.03 1.09 0.56 Pro-forma earnings per ADS: Basic 1.05 1.08 0.55 Diluted 1.05 1.08 0.55 e On 1 January 2003, BG Group adopted FAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations.
The standard requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognised in the period in which it is incurred, if capable of estimation, concurrent with an increase in the related assets carrying value.
The increase in this carrying value is then amortised over its useful life.
Although similar to UK GAAP FRS 12, Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, FAS 143 requires entities to use a creditadjusted discount rate.
BG Group has used a rate of 5.5%.
Further details on decommissioning are given on page 90. f Under UK GAAP, where the Group has contractual rights to liquidated damages to reimburse income lost as a result of delays to commissioning of assets under construction, the liquidated damages are accounted for as income.
Liquidated damages recognised during 2004 and 2003 have been accounted for under US GAAP as a reduction in the value of the asset constructed.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 30 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued g FAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by FAS 138 and FAS 149, establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
In general, FAS 133 requires that companies recognise all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measures those instruments at fair value.
BG Group uses derivative instruments to manage the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices, interest rates and foreign currencies.
The terms of the instruments range between 1 and 15 years.
Commodity contracts accounted for as derivatives under FAS 133 are marked-tomarket and the fair value has been determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk-free discount rate.
The 547m 2003 269m reconciling difference between net assets under UK and US GAAP in respect of the valuation of these contracts comprises assets of 12m 2003 30m offset by liabilities of 559m 2003 299m, nil 2003 nil of which is included within net assets under UK GAAP.
On adoption of FAS 133, the current US GAAP hedging relationships for BG Groups existing currency and interest rate swaps were fidedesignated and marked-to-market.
The fair value of these instruments has been determined based on quoted market prices for the same or similar instruments.
The currency and interest rate derivative instruments are included within net assets under US GAAP as a 177m asset 2003 150m asset, comprising assets of 208m 2003 167m offset by liabilities of 31m 2003 17m.
Under UK GAAP, assets of 180m 2003 151m and liabilities of nil 2003 1m have been recognised leading to a net asset of 180m 2003 150m.
There are a number of issues pending before the FASB, which may have a material impact on the application of FAS 133: and BG Groups results under US GAAP will continue to see volatility due to the requirements of this standard to mark-to-market a number of instruments and contracts at a point in time.
Emerging Issues Task Force EITF Issue 02-03, Accounting for Contracts Involved in Energy Trading and Risk Management Activities, was issued in January 2002 and is effective from 25 October 2002 for all new contracts entered into after that date and for fiscal periods beginning after 15 December 2002 for contracts that remain in effect as of the date of the adoption of this standard.
EITF 02-03 replaces EITF 98-10 and addresses certain issues related to energy trading activities, including gross versus net presentation in the income statement, whether the initial fair value of an energy trading contract can be other than the price at which it was exchanged, mark-tomarket accounting when a contract does not meet the definition of a derivative under FAS 133 and additional disclosure requirements for energy trading activities.
The adoption of this Issue has not had a material impact on BG Groups 2003 or 2004 Financial Statements.
During 2004 and 2003, energy trading activities, as defined by FAS 133, comprised forward based physicaland cash-settled gas contracts consisting of forwards, futures and options: and cash-settled oil futures contracts.
The fair value, based on external market quotes, of such commodity contracts included within net assets under US GAAP includes an asset of 1m 2003 8m liability relating to energy trading 105 contracts.
The table below shows the reconciliation between the opening and closing values of BG Groups energy trading contracts: 2004 2003 m m Value of energy trading contracts as at 1 January 8 9 Realised gains losses 8 9 Unrealised gains losses arising in year 1 8 Value of energy trading contracts as at 31 December 1 8 The closing balance includes assets of 1m attributable to energy trading contracts maturing in 2005. h The disposal of the Groups interests in the Muturi Production Sharing Contract in 2004 included an element of unrealised foreign exchange losses previously recognised through other comprehensive income as currency translation adjustments.
On disposal, these foreign exchange losses are recycled through the income statement as a loss on disposal and removed from other comprehensive income.
The disposal in 2003 of a number of UK North Sea gas production assets included an element of decommissioning obligations.
The difference between these obligations under UK and US GAAP has resulted in a difference in profit on disposal.
i Under UK GAAP, currency translation adjustments on borrowings are taken to reserves to offset the foreign exchange exposure on foreign investments.
Under US GAAP, the currency translation adjustment on those borrowings would be expensed through the income statement.
j Under UK GAAP, provision for deferred income tax is required on a full provision basis in accordance with FRS 19, Deferred Tax.
US GAAP FAS 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, similarly requires deferred tax to be provided on a full liability basis.
The balance sheet adjustment is calculated under FAS 109 and the deferred tax balances carried forward under US GAAP are shown below: as at 31 December 2004 2003 m m Capital allowances for property, plant and equipment 793 804 Temporary differences in respect of US GAAP adjustments 85 147 Petroleum revenue tax 29 27 737 684 Deferred tax assets 160 138 Net deferred tax liabilities under US GAAP 577 546 Net deferred tax recognised under UK GAAP 662 693 Net US GAAP adjustment 85 147 BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 30 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued A deferred tax provision of 131m in respect of intangible and tangible fixed assets adjusted to fair value on the acquisition of entities is recognised under US GAAP: under UK GAAP, deferred tax is not provided on fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions.
k In accordance with FAS 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, BG Groups listed investments are revalued at each period end, with differences charged or credited to other comprehensive income.
Under UK GAAP, investments are held at cost less any provision for impairment.
The aggregate fair value of the Groups available-for-sale equity securities as at 31 December 2004 was nil 2003 32m.
There was no material difference between UK and US GAAP in 2004 or 2002. l Under UK GAAP, FRS 3, Reporting Financial Performance, requires that the disposal of businesses meeting specific criteria be reported as discontinued operations.
Operations not satisfying all these conditions are classified as continuing.
Under US GAAP, FAS 144 requires a different set of conditions to be fulfilled in order to classify a disposal of a business as discontinuing.
In 2004, BG Group disposed of its interests in the Muturi Production Sharing Contract.
In addition, management is committed to a plan to dispose of Premier Transmission Limited, a UK joint venture.
In 2003, the Group disposed of a number of UK North Sea gas production assets, Phoenix Natural Gas Limited and, in 2002, Iqara EcoFuels Limited see note 6, page 78.
Also in 2003, BG Groups management committed to sell its investments in the North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement.
Management expects this sale to complete in 2005.
These are classified as discontinued operations under US GAAP.
m A reconciliation of basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share is arrived at by adjusting both the numerator and denominator with the adjustments given in note 10, page 81. n Under UK GAAP, dividends are recorded in the year in respect of which they are declared or proposed.
Under US GAAP, dividends are recorded only in the period in which they are formally declared.
EXPLANATION OF UK US RECONCILING DIFFERENCES NOT QUANTIFIED A Under FRS 3, income and expenses from non-recurring and significant transactions arising other than in the course of the Groups ordinary activities are recorded as exceptional items.
Items classified by BG Group as exceptional under UK GAAP see note 6, page 78 do not meet the definition of extraordinary under US GAAP and would be classified as operating items.
This difference does not result in a difference in net income under UK GAAP and US GAAP.
B Under UK GAAP, the Groups Financial Statements include a consolidated profit and loss account, presented in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and FRS 3.
Under US GAAP, certain items are included in different lines on the income statement than under UK 106 GAAP.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a consolidated income statement in a US GAAP format, but using UK GAAP figures: 2004 2003 2002 m m m Total revenue 4 082 3 587 2 610 Operating costs 2 763 2 542 1 889 Profit loss on disposal of fixed assets 92 117 14 Operating income 1 411 1 162 707 Net interest 26 25 32 Profit before income taxes 1 385 1 137 675 Income taxes 576 479 354 Share of net income in affiliates 123 130 99 Minority interests in income of consolidated entities 28 20 10 Net income 904 768 410 The adjustments included in the income statement above include the following items: an increase in operating costs and a reduction in interest in connection with the interest charge on the unwinding of the Groups decommissioning provisions: and a reduction in operating income, interest and income taxes and a corresponding increase in net income from affiliates, to show the presentation of this item below income taxes.
C In 2000, BG Group received proceeds of 168m in connection with the securitisation of receivables under the Premier Power CCGT transaction.
US GAAP treats these proceeds as debt compared to deferred revenue under UK GAAP.
No adjustment is required to the reconciliation of shareholders funds since the difference between the UK and US GAAP treatment is not significant as at 31 December 2004.
Under US GAAP, this would give rise to debt of 137m, as at 31 December 2004, bearing interest at a rate of 7.62% and maturing in March 2012.
The increase in US GAAP interest expense would be offset by increased turnover.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 30 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued D Under UK GAAP, the balance sheets are presented in ascending order of liquidity, whereas under US GAAP assets are presented in descending order of liquidity.
Also under UK GAAP, the balance sheet is analysed between net assets and shareholders funds.
Under US GAAP, the analysis is between total assets and total liabilities plus shareholders equity.
Certain items which are disclosed in the notes under UK GAAP would be disclosed on the face of the balance sheet under US GAAP.
Also under US GAAP, debtors due after more than one year of 96m 2003 88m included within current assets in UK GAAP would be classified under long-term debtors.
E Under UK GAAP, BG Groups Financial Statements include a cash flow statement in accordance with FRS 1 revised 1996, Cash Flow Statements.
This statement presents substantially the same information as that required under FAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
FAS 95 only requires presentation of cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities.
Set out below, for illustrative purposes, is a summary consolidated statement of cash flows: for the year ended 31 December 2004 2003 2002 m m m Net cash provided by operating activities 1 180 1 082 745 Net cash used in investing activities 1 135 811 1 311 Net cash used in provided by financing activities 27 301 623 Net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 18 30 57 Cash and cash equivalents at the start of the year 112 14192 Foreign exchange 2 1 8 Cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year 132 112 141 Cash and cash equivalents are cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand with a maturity or period of notice of 24 hours or one working day.
F In May 2003, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue 01-08, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease.
This Issue provides guidance for determining whether an arrangement for the right of use of property, plant and equipment contains a lease in accordance with FAS 13, Accounting for Leases.
If it is determined that a lease exists, the lease and non-lease components of a combined arrangement must be accounted for separately.
EITF 01-08 is effective for all arrangements initiated, modified or acquired in the first reporting period beginning after 28 May 2003.
The adoption of EITF 01-08 has not had an impact on BG Groups 2003 or 2004 Financial Statements.
G In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect 107 Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under guarantees.
FIN 45 also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees.
It requires the guarantor to recognise a liability for the non-contingent component of the guarantee.
This is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur.
The initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception.
The recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements.
BG Group has adopted the disclosure requirements and has applied the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after 31 December 2002.
The adoption of this Interpretation did not affect shareholders funds or net income.
Since 1 January 2003, BG Group has issued or modified guarantees to joint ventures and associated undertakings with a maximum exposure of 233m.
Their fair value as at 31 December 2004 was 5m 2003 5m.
These guarantees relate to the Groups Egyptian LNG facilities.
Further disclosures about BG Groups guarantees, commitments and contingencies are given in note 26, page 93.
H In January 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which interprets Accounting Research Bulletin ARB 51, Consolidated Financial Statements.
FIN 46 was replaced by FIN 46 R, containing significant revisions to the original Interpretation, in December 2003.
FIN 46 R clarifies the application of ARB 51 with respect to the consolidation of certain entities variable interest entities VIEs to which the usual condition for consolidation described in ARB 51 does not apply because the controlling financial interest in VIEs may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests.
In addition, FIN 46 R requires the primary beneficiary of VIEs and the holder of a significant variable interest in VIEs to disclose certain information relating to their involvement with the VIEs.
BG Group adopted FIN 46 for all entities created between 31 January 2003 and 31 December 2003 and adopted FIN 46 R for all entities created before 1 February 2003 and after 1 January 2004.
The impact of the adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46 R has not had an effect on BG Groups 2003 or 2004 Financial Statements.
I Following the devaluation of the Argentine Peso, MetroGAS and its holding company Gas Argentino announced in 2002 that they were suspending payments of principal and interest on their financial indebtedness of approximately $450m for MetroGAS and a further $70m for Gas Argentino.
These debts are without recourse to BG Group.
These subsidiaries are now in the process of a capital restructuring.
It is expected that this will lead to a change in the ownership structure and this in turn could result in BG Group ceasing to consolidate these reporting units as subsidiaries.
On 7 November 2003, MetroGAS announced an offer to restructure its financial obligations pursuant to an out of court agreement.
Work on restructuring the MetroGAS debt continues.
Since the beginning of the debt restructuring, BG Group has publicly announced that it has no obligation to financially support, nor will it financially support, either Gas Argentino or MetroGAS.
As the Group has no obligation to make good the losses in either company, it has not recognised the losses of the minority interests within BG Group shareholders funds.
BG GROUP ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 30 US GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES continued NEW US GAAP ACCOUNTING STANDARDS On 16 December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123 R, Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of FAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
FAS 123 R supersedes APB Opinion 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends FAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows.
Generally, the approach in FAS 123 R is similar to the approach described in FAS 123.
However, FAS 123 R requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognised in the income statement based on their fair values.
Proforma disclosure is no longer an alternative.
FAS 123 R is effective from the first interim or annual period beginning after 15 June 2005.
BG Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting FAS 123 R on the Groups consolidated Financial Statements.
In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No.
This new standard is effective for inventory costs incurred in annual periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
BG Group does not believe that the application of FAS 151 will have a material impact on the Groups consolidated Financial Statements.
In December 2004, the FASB issued FAS 153, Exchanges on Nonmonetary Assets an amendment of APB Opinion No.
FAS 153 eliminates the exception from fair value measurement of nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets in APB 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and replaces it with an exception for exchanges that do not have commercial substance.
The standard is effective for nonmonetary asset exchanges occurring in annual periods beginning after 15 June 2005.
BG Group is currently assessing the impact of adopting FAS 143 on its consolidated Financial Statements.
