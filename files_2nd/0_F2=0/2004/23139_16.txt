Investments Listed investments are valued at market prices, foreign currencies being converted at the rates of exchange ruling at the relevant balance sheet date.
Unlisted investments are valued by the directors, taking account of latest dealing prices, brokers valuations and other available accounting information as appropriate.
Realised capital reserves Gains and losses on realisation of investments and differences on exchange are dealt with in the realised capital reserves.
The capital element of the investment management fee along with the associated irrecoverable VAT and relevant finance costs are charged to this reserve.

At the year end, the company has surplus loan relationship losses being the excess of interest payable on the debenture stocks and any other borrowing over interest receivable and surplus management expenses totalling 51,051,341 200343,077,560.
These have been generated because such a large part of the companys income is derived from dividends from UK companies.
Such dividend income does not fall to be taxed within the corporation tax regime and the company therefore has very little income against which to deduct its expenses and finance costs.
These losses are not recognised as a deferred tax asset.
This is because the company is not expected to generate taxable income in a future period in excess of deductible expenses for that future period and, accordingly, is unlikely to be able to reduce future tax liabilities by offsetting these losses.

The analysis of total shareholders funds on the face of the balance sheet does not reflect the rights, under the articles of association, of the ordinary shareholders on a return of assets.
These rights are reflected in the net asset value and the net asset value per share attributable to ordinary shareholders at the year end, adjusted to reflect the deduction of the debenture stock at par.

The company has established a framework for managing these risks which is evolving continually as the companys investment activities change in response to market developments.
The board has provided the Manager with guidelines and limits for the management of gearing, investments and financial instruments.
Market risk Market risk arises from changes in interest rates, valuations accorded to equities, movements in prices and the liquidity of financial instruments.
Market price risk is managed through investment guidelines agreed by the board with the Manager and is discussed at each board meeting.
Gearing It is the companys policy to increase its exposure to the equity market through the judicious use of borrowings.
When borrowed funds are invested in equities the effect is to magnify the impact on shareholders funds of changes both positive and negative in the value of the portfolio.
During the year to 31 January 2004, the companys only borrowings were its long term debentures, details of which can be found in note 12 on page 31.
These borrowings can be valued either at par or at their market value and the board monitors them on both bases of valuation.
The board regulates the overall level of gearing by raising or lowering cash balances and is also able, if the circumstances warrant, to use derivatives or to purchase fixed interest securities in order to offset the effect of gearing.
It is the boards policy to maintain a gearing level, measured on the most stringent basis of calculation, of less than 30% at all times.
Financial assets and liabilities The companys financial instruments comprise equity investments, derivative contracts, treasury bills, AAA money market funds, cash balances, debenture stocks and debtors and creditors that arise directly from its operations: for example, in respect of sales and purchases awaiting settlement.
Fixed asset investments see note 9 are valued at middle market prices which equate to their fair values.
The fair values of all other assets and liabilities are represented by their carrying values in the balance sheet.
