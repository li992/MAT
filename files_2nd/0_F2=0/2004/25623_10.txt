Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 53 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31st December, 2004 1 Restatement of comparatives During the period, the Group has adopted Financial Reporting Standard 17 Retirement Benefits.
The impact of this change is to fully recognise the financial position of its defined benefit pension schemes.
Actuarial valuations are updated at 31st December each year.
Details of the latest actuarial valuation and the assumptions used are given in note 32 on pages 82 to 85.
Since the publication of the interim results in July 2004 the impact of the restatement on the deferred tax asset at 31st December, 2003 has been revised.
Following the publication in December 2003 of UITF, abstract 17 revised - Employee share schemes and UITF, abstract 38 - Accounting for ESOP trusts, the Group has adopted the requirements of both abstracts.
The impact of these changes is that own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust are no longer carried as an asset on the Group balance sheet but rather treated as a deduction from shareholders funds via the profit and loss reserve.
In addition, the basis of calculating the profit and loss charge for ESOP amortisation has been revised to reflect the share price at date of option grant rather than the average cost price basis previously used.

Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 63 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31st December, 2004 11 Services provided by the Group's auditor and network firms continued Further assurance services During 2004 an amount totalling 713,000 was paid to the Group auditor in connection with due diligence work relating to acquisitions made in Latin America as detailed in note 31.
These fees have been included in the cost of investment.
These are services that are provided by an independent accountant but unrelated to the statutory audit.
In these cases the Group has or, in the case of the Group pension scheme, the trustees have discretion as to whether or not to appoint the external auditor, although in many instances the external auditor will be best placed to undertake the work due to its in-depth knowledge of the Group.
The following are examples of services that would generally be regarded as falling under the heading: Audit of Group pension schemes.
Work in connection with Class 1 Circulars and Listing Particulars.
Non-regulatory reporting on internal controls or corporate governance matters, eg.
reports commissioned by the Group Audit Committee.
Advice on accounting matters and reviews of Accounting Standards where these are unrelated to the statutory audit.
The Audit & Compliance Committee has a policy on the use of the external auditors for non-audit services to ensure that the auditors' independence is maintained and it is involved in the decisions on all such appointments over 50,000.
Each year a limit is set on the total fees that can be paid to the external auditor in relation to other services not referred to above.
For 2004, the Audit & Compliance Committee has set this limit at one third of statutory audit fees.

16 Earnings per share i Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit after taxation and minority interests by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
ii Fully diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit after taxation and minority interests by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
iii Basic earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
iv Fully diluted earnings per share, excluding exceptional items, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
v Basic earnings per share, excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation by the weighted average number of shares in issue.
vi Fully diluted earnings per share, excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation, are calculated by dividing the adjusted profit excluding exceptional items and goodwill amortisation by the adjusted weighted average number of shares in issue.
The weighted average number of shares in issue for 2003 has been calculated after excluding the Groups share of MAROT's interest in the share capital of Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc, prior to its disposal.
Shares held by the Trustees of the Employees Share Ownership Plan Trust in respect of the Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group Restricted Share Scheme have also been excluded.
The comparative financial information has been restated as explained in note 1 on page 54.

Following this transaction the entire issued capital of Marot Participations was acquired by a new holding company, Courcelles Participations, as part of a shareholder restructuring.
Courcelles acquired Marot at fair value and consequently recognised goodwill on acquisition.
The Group exchanged its 31% shareholding in Marot for a 31% shareholding in Courcelles and 31,663,000 in cash.
UITF 31 issued in October 2001 provides the appropriate Group accounting treatment.
UITF 31 confirms that to the extent the Group retains an ownership interest in the underlying business of Marot, that retained interest including any related pre-transaction goodwill, should be consolidated at its pre-transaction amount.
UITF 31 prohibits the Group from recognising its share of the fair value of Courcelles on its balance sheet.
As a consequence the Group was required to treat the cash receipt from this transaction as a distribution from Courcelles which results in a negative carrying value for this investment.
FRS 9, Associates and Joint Ventures requires that this negative carrying value be regarded and presented as a liability even though no real liability exists.
The accounting treatment required by UITF 31 and FRS 9 does not reflect the true economic worth of this investment.

Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 69 Notes to the Financial Statements For the year ended 31st December, 2004 20 Employee benefit trusts The Group operates a restricted share scheme Jardine Lloyd Thompson Restricted Share Scheme by way of a discretionary, unconsolidated, employee benefit trust.
The asset referred to as Own Shares represents funds advanced to the trust for the purpose of purchasing JLT shares to satisfy awards made under this scheme.
In December 2003 UITF abstract 17 revised - Employee share schemes - and UITF abstract 38 - Accounting for ESOP trusts - were published as noted in note 1 on page 54.
The Group has adopted the requirements of both abstracts, as a consequence of which Own shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust are no longer carried as an asset on the Group balance sheet but rather treated as a deduction from shareholders funds via the profit and loss reserve.
However, the cost of these awards continues to be amortised to the Group profit and loss account over the vesting period of the award.
The Group operates a deferred compensation scheme represented principally by Unit Trusts.
Investments held by this scheme are classified as fixed assets on the balance sheets and amortised to the Group profit and loss account over the vesting periods of the award.
The number of fully paid ordinary shares held by the trustees under employee benefit trusts and their market value was: Number of shares 2004 2003 Allocated 8,307,593 6,682,048 Shortfall unallocated 578,087 187,866 7,729,506 6,869,914 Market value 2004 2003 000 000 Allocated 30,904,246 35,247,803 Shortfall unallocated 2,150,484 990,993 28,753,762 36,238,796 At 31st December, 2004 there are awards granted in respect of 940,203 shares 2003: 940,203 which are subject to performance conditions which are not expected to be achieved.
As a consequence no amortisation has been charged in respect of these awards.

At 31st December, 2004 the Group had outstanding contracts amounting to 54,653,000 2003: 177,676,000. e Legal and other loss contingencies Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc and its subsidiaries are subject to various claims and legal proceedings principally consisting of alleged errors and omissions in connection with the placement of insurance reinsurance and consulting services.
UK GAAP requires that liabilities for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred before the balance sheet date and the amount can be reasonably estimated.
Significant management judgement is required to comply with this guidance.
The Group analyses its litigation exposure based on available information, including external legal consultation where appropriate, to asses its potential liability.
On the basis of present information, amounts already provided, availability of insurance coverages and legal advice received, it is the opinion of management that the disposition or ultimate determination of such claims will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the Group.
However, it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any annual period could be materially affected by an unfavourable resolution of these matters.
86 Jardine Lloyd Thompson Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements 34 Derivatives and other financial instruments Financial instruments This note contains disclosures as required under FRS 13, Derivatives and other Financial Instruments.
The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash, short term deposits, money market funds, negotiable money market investments, bonds, borrowings, finance leases, loan notes and provisions in respect of property commitments.
Short term debtors and creditors other than borrowings have been excluded from the following disclosures.
As explained on page 20 of the Financial Review and pages 31 and 32 of the Directors Report, the Group enters into derivative transactions to manage the fluctuations in currency and interest earnings that arise from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates.
The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts, currency options, forward rate agreements, interest rate swaps and interest rate options matched by underlying investments and revenue flows to manage these risks.
The Group finances its operations principally by the cash generated by operating companies and to a lesser extent by the use of borrowings and finance leases.
Interest rate and currency profile of financial assets financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities consist of borrowings, finance leases, loan notes and provisions to cover property commitments.
The following table provides an analysis of the borrowings between fixed and floating elements: Other Weighted Total gross financial Weighted average Floating rate Fixed rate borrowings liabilities average time fixed Currency 000 000 000 000 fixed rate years Sterling 25,311 311 25,622 12,020 3.0% 0.1 Australian dollars 1,105 - 1,105--- US dollars 156 - 156 911 - - Total as at 31st December, 2004 26,572 311 26,883 12,931 - - Sterling 35 5,482 5,517 12,763 2.1% 0.9 Australian dollars 1,071 - 1,071--- US dollars - - - 1,946 - - Total as at 31st December, 2003 1,106 5,482 6,588 14,709 - - Other financial liabilities represent property provisions under which no interest is paid.

The fair value of cash, short-term deposits, negotiable money market investments, money market funds, bank borrowings and overdrafts are based on the carrying value of the instruments.
Bonds are valued at market bid price.
The fair value of forward rate agreements, interest rate options, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange forward contracts are based on the market bid prices as at the balance sheet date.
Currency exposures As explained on page 20 of the Financial Review, the Groups major transaction exposure arises in respect of the US dollar revenue earned in the UK, where it accounts for approximately 44% 2003: 48% of total UK revenue.
The Group therefore adopts a prudent approach to the management of this exposure by maintaining a rolling hedging programme using forward contracts and options.
The currency exposure of the Groups net monetary assets liabilities is shown in the table opposite.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved.
Gains and losses on the revaluation of monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account.
