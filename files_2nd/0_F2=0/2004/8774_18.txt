Certain financial assets such as investments in subsidiary companies and short-term debtors and creditors other than those required for currency exposures are excluded from the scope of these disclosures.
a Financial risks and policies Set out below is a summary of the main financial risks faced by the Group during the accounting period and the policies employed to address these risks.
These policies have been applied consistently throughout the accounting period and are explained in more detail in the Financial review on page 11.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy throughout the accounting period has been to use the revolving bank credit facility together with the unsecured term loan granted to TJ Hughes Limited up to the date of sale of this subsidiary, to achieve continuity of funding and short-term flexibility.
Interest rate risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and the bank borrowings.
Floating rates of interest are charged on the bank borrowings.
No interest rate hedging agreement is currently in place and given the level of borrowings and the current interest rate environment: the Board does not consider fluctuations in interest rates to pose a significant risk to the Group.
Foreign currency risk The majority of the Groups trading activities are conducted with United Kingdom suppliers and customers, the transactions being payable and receivable in sterling: only approximately 25 million of the Groups annualised purchases are settled in US dollars.
Up to August 2003, the Group had a hedging agreement in place in respect of its forward dollar requirements which protected the Groups trading position and balance sheet from significant exchange rate movements.
However, from September 2003, dollars are being bought and held in a dollar bank account, equivalent at any time to the value of approximately 3 months payables.

c Office of Fair Trading In August 2003, the Office of Fair Trading OFT pronounced JJB guilty of price-fixing in the sale of certain replica kit products over a two year period during 2000 and 2001 and levied a fine of 8.4 million.
JJB appealed against the decision of the OFT to the independent Competition Appeals Tribunal CAT : the appeal was conducted during March 2004 and the decision of the CAT is awaited in the near future.
No provision has been made in respect of this fine in JJBs accounts as, on the basis of advice received, the Board believes that the appeal will be successful.

30 Transactions with related parties a Whelco Holdings Limited is a company owned by members of the family of the Chairman, D. Whelan, which operates itself or through its subsidiaries, a number of businesses including that of Wigan Athletic Football Club WAFC, Wigan Warriors Rugby League Club, the stadium in which both teams play, which is known as the JJB Stadium, and Orrell Rugby Union Club.
During the period ended 25 January 2004, the Company acted as sponsors of these clubs and the amount of sponsorship paid was 174,000 2003 - 150,000, 347,000 2003 - 340,000 and 45,000 2003 - 50,000 respectively.
Also during the period ended 25 January 2004, the Company paid 150,000 2003 - 150,000 for the naming rights for the stadium.
Advice was taken from independent third parties as to comparative levels of the costs of sponsorship and naming rights at other clubs and stadia, prior to the above amounts being agreed.
In addition, the Company provided certain motor vehicles to WAFC in their capacity as sponsors, the running costs of which for the period ended 25 January 2004 were 12,242 2003 - 11,743, including depreciation of 9,649 2003 - 10,960. b In February 2000, the freehold interest of a store in Northampton, which the Company had leased from a third party for a number of years and at which it had operated a retail store until October 1998, was acquired from the third party by the Trustees of the David Whelan Accumulation and Maintenance Settlement a Settlement in which the Chairman, D. Whelan, has an interest.
Rent under the original lease was payable by the Company to the Settlement at the rate of 80,000 per annum whilst the site was being developed to create a new superstore.
Costs involved in developing the site amounting to approximately 1 million were incurred by the Company but reimbursed by the Settlement in January 2004.
The Company commenced its store refit in June 2003 and was granted a three month rent free period by the Settlement until 2 September 2003 from which date the Company has paid rent on a full commercial basis at the rate of 150,000 per annum.
c In July 2003, JJB ceased to trade in a loss-making store situated in Manchester.
The property was sub-let to Sharpe Knight Limited, a company owned by T. W. Knight, JJBs Chief Executive, and Mrs. J. Sharpe, the daughter of the Chairman, D. Whelan.
The terms of the sub-let, which were completed on a full commercial basis, included the granting of a rent-free period of five months to Sharpe Knight Limited from the date of their entry to the premises, with a subsequent rent payable of 480,000 per annum being equivalent to that payable by JJB to their landlord.
