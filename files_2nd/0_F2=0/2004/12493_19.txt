The following detailed disclosures with regard to the use of financial instruments and derivatives exclude short term trade debtors and creditors where permitted by FRS13.
1 Foreign Currency Risk The Group hedges transactions primarily related to the purchase and sale of inventories denominated in foreign currencies through foreign exchange forward contracts.
These contracts reduce currency risk from exchange rate movements with respect to these transactions and related cash flows.
Gains and losses are deferred and accounted for as part of the underlying transactions.
The Group does not hedge profit translation exposure, unless there is a corresponding cashflow, since such hedges provide only a temporary deferral of the effects of movements in exchange rates.
Similarly, whilst a significant proportion of the Groups borrowings are denominated in US dollars, the Group does not specifically hedge all of its long-term investments in overseas assets.
Currency translation gains, amounting to 9.8 million in the year ended 1st February 2004 and currency translation losses amounting to 0.3 million in the year ended 2nd February 2003, have been credited charged to reserves in relation to the translation of net assets in foreign currencies.
54 PREMIER FARNELL PLC NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2004 CONTINUED NOTE 16 CONTINUED At 1st February 2004 the gross notional amount of foreign exchange forward contracts to sell foreign currencies, all of which had maturities of less than one year, totalled 64.2 million 2003: 14.0 million and can be analysed as follows: Commitments to sell foreign currency Sterling equivalent Unrecognised deferred gains and losses 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Euros 10.9 11.6 0.1 0.1 Australian dollars 0.6 2.4 US Dollars 52.7 64.2 14.0 0.1 0.1 The commitment to sell US dollars is linked to the Groups US dollar denominated borrowings referred to below which provide a hedge against the Groups US dollar investments.
The unrealised exchange gain on this US dollar commitment has been reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
In addition, at 1st February 2004, the Group had entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to buy 0.9 million 2003: nil of US dollars on which there was an unrecognised loss of 0.1 million.
The unrecognised deferred gains and losses in respect of foreign exchange forward contracts are estimated by reference to the amounts not yet recognised that the Group would receive or pay to terminate the contracts based on year end rates.
During the financial year, the Group has not used any other financial instruments to hedge trading foreign exchange rate exposures.
The Groups primary translation exposure relates to the relative values of the pound sterling and US dollar.
Although the US business generates significant US dollar trading cash flows, the Groups borrowings are predominantly US dollar denominated.
Management anticipates that the ongoing US dollar interest and dividend obligations together with US dollar trade payments in the UK will continue to preclude the need to enter into any significant hedging of US dollar cash flows.
At 1st February 2004 the Group had the equivalent of 4.5 million 2003: 3.6 million of predominantly Euro denominated net financial assets in non-functional currencies in relation to which future movements in foreign currencies could have a limited impact on consolidated profit.
2 Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through a combination of retained cash flow, equity and non-equity shares and short and medium term borrowings.
Procedures are in place to monitor and manage interest rate risk with derivatives being entered into when considered appropriate by management.

These plans are devised in accordance with local conditions and practices in the countries concerned and include defined contribution and defined benefit schemes.
The assets of the plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
The contributions to the plans are assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice principally using the projected unit method of valuation.
The net credit for the year relating to all of the Groups pension plans amounted to 2.9 million 2003: 4.4 million.
The Groups two principal plans operate in the UK and the US.
Further disclosures of these plans are set out below: UK Plan US Plan 6th April 31st October Last valuation date 2002 2003 m m Market value of investments at last valuation date 53.1 123.2 Regular pension cost 0.3 1.8 Interest on prepaid asset 6.8 Amortisation of variation 0.4 1.0 Total pension cost credit 0.7 6.0 Level of funding, being the actuarial value of assets expressed as a percentage of the accrued service liabilities 94% 263% The principal assumptions used in the actuarial valuation of the UK Plan were a weighted average projected investment return of 6.4% per annum, salary inflation of 4.3% per annum and pension increases of 2.8% per annum.
For the US Plan, the principal actuarial assumptions were a weighted average projected investment return of 8.5% per annum and salary inflation of 5.0% per annum.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the remaining service lives of current employees in the plans.
The final salary section of the UK Plan was closed to new entrants in 1998 as a result of which, under the projected unit method, the current service cost of the scheme will increase as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
Members at that date now receive benefits funded through a combination of the US Plan and the UK Plan, including contributions to the money purchase section within the UK Plan.
Employees joining the UK Plan since 1st January 1999 are entitled to money purchase benefits only.
An asset of 79.6 million 2003: 82.2 million is included in debtors, representing the excess of the actuarial value of the assets over the accrued service liabilities of the US Plan.
