Statement of Directors responsibilities The following statement, which should be read in conjunction with the report of the auditors set out on pages 32 and 33, is made with a view to distinguishing for shareholders the respective responsibilities of the directors and of the auditors in relation to the financial statements.
The Directors are required by the Companies Act 1985 to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at the end of the financial year and of the profit or loss of the Group for the financial year.
The Directors consider that in preparing the financial statements, appropriate accounting policies have been consistently applied, supported by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates, and that all applicable accounting standards have been followed.
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to meet its operational needs for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for ensuring that accounting records are kept which disclose, with reasonable accuracy, the financial position of the Company and which enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
