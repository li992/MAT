110 Friends Provident Achieved profit Supplementary Information continued Notes to the achieved profit results 1.
Achieved profit results The achieved profit results were approved by the Board of Directors on 17 March 2005.
Basis of preparation In order to identify the value being generated by the Groups business, the directors use the achieved profit basis of reporting in respect of the Life & Pensions business combined with the modied statutory solvency MSS basis for the remainder of the business.
The achieved profit basis of reporting is designed to recognise profit as it is earned over the term of a life assurance policy.
The total profit recognised over the lifetime of the policy is the same as that recognised under the MSS basis of reporting, but the timing of the recognition is different.
The achieved profit results have been prepared in accordance with the methodology and disclosure requirements contained in the guidance Supplementary reporting for long-term insurance business the achieved profits method issued by The Association of British Insurers in December 2001.
The guidance aims to provide an appropriate method of recognising shareholder profits from long-term business.
The guidance states that achieved profit should be calculated net of tax and then grossed up at the effective rate of shareholder tax.
The full standard rate of corporation tax has been used to gross up after tax profits, as this closely resembles the effective rate.
Shareholders funds on an achieved profit basis provides an estimate of the value of the shareholders interest in a life assurance business excluding any value which may be generated from future new life and pensions business.
They comprise the sum of shareholders net worth and the value of existing business.
The shareholders net worth is the net assets attributable to shareholders.
The value of existing business is the present value of the projected stream of future after tax distributable profit available to shareholders from the existing business at the valuation date, adjusted where appropriate for the cost of holding the minimum statutory solvency margin.
Shareholders funds on an achieved profit basis for the Friends Provident Group consists of the following: i Life & Pensions net assets: ii the Groups share of its investment in the Asset Management business valued on a modied statutory solvency basis: iii corporate net liabilities: iv the net pension liability of FPPS on an FRS17 basis net of deferred tax : and v the present value of the future profits attributable to shareholders from existing policies of the Life & Pensions business.
In addition, a pro forma embedded value has been reported showing shareholders funds on an achieved profit basis adjusted to include the Asset Management listed subsidiary at market value.
Life & Pensions achieved operating profit a.
Contribution from new business The contribution from new business for the year ended 31 December 2004 is calculated using economic assumptions at the beginning of the year.
The contribution from new business before the cost of solvency capital and pension service charge using end of period economic assumptions amounted to 84m for the year ended 31 December 2004.
The contribution from new Life & Pensions business before tax is calculated by grossing up the contribution from new Life & Pensions business after tax at the full standard rate of corporation tax.
In respect of stakeholder style pension business, where a regular pattern in the receipt of premiums has been established, the business has been treated as regular premium business.
b. profit from existing business profit from existing Life & Pensions business comprises the expected return on the value of in-force business at the start of the period plus the impact of any changes in the assumptions regarding future operating experience, changes in the reserving basis other than economic assumption changes and profits and losses caused by differences between the actual experience for the period and the assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the end of the period.
Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets supporting the in-force with profits business over its lifetime, after providing for an estimate of the cost of guaranteed benets calculated on a stochastic basis, and are consistent with the economic assumptions and the companys bonus policy.
The proportion of surplus allocated to shareholders on conventional with profits business has been assumed to be 10%.
c. Development costs Development costs represent investment in developing advanced electronic trading systems, e-commerce related activities, and service automation and improvement.
Annual Report & Accounts 2004 111 Achieved profit Supplementary Information continued Notes to the achieved profit results continued 4.
Asset Management Asset Management is treated as a separate business segment and thus the profit on investment management fees charged to the Life & Pensions business, approximately 11m for the year ended 31 December 2004, is included within Asset Management operating profit 2003: approximately 7m.
Expected return on shareholders net assets a.
Expected return on corporate net assets The expected return on corporate net assets is the longer-term investment return on assets held by Friends Provident plc and its non-life subsidiaries.
It excludes the expected return on the net pension liability and the result of the Asset Management business which are shown separately in the summary consolidated profit and loss account.
Expected return on shareholders net assets within the Life & Pensions business The expected return on shareholders net assets held within the Life & Pensions business comprises the return on the shareholders net assets held by the life assurance companies within that business, using the investment return assumptions used to calculate the embedded value at the beginning of the period.
Operating exceptional items Operating exceptional items borne by shareholders are: 2004 2003 m m Closure of Direct Sales operation i v 2 14 Life & Pensions integration costs ii v 9 9 Provision release of provision for misselling complaints iii v 14 14 Asset Management integration costs iv 19 12 Gross up for shareholder tax v 8 1 52 22 i The charge of 2m for 2004 represents the expenses relating to the reorganisation of the Appointed Representatives sales channel.

Basic and operating earnings per share Earnings per share have been calculated based on operating profit before amortisation of goodwill and operating exceptional items, after tax, and on the profit after tax attributable to equity shareholders, as the directors believe the former earnings per share gure gives a better indication of operating performance.

Sensitivity analysis The table below shows the contribution from new Life & Pensions business, before the cost of solvency capital and the pension service charge, before tax and the value of existing Life & Pensions business, assuming a 1% increase in the rate of investment return on equities and properties and, separately, a 1% increase in the risk discount rate all other assumptions remaining unchanged : 2004 2003 m m Contribution from new Life & Pensions business before cost of solvency capital and pension service charge, before tax 83 80 After the impact of a 1% increase in investment returns on equities and properties 91 90 After the impact of a 1% increase in the risk discount rate 58 55 Value of existing Life & Pensions business 1,613 1,352 After the impact of a 1% increase in investment returns on equities and properties 1,651 1,394 After the impact of a 1% increase in the risk discount rate 1,488 1,233 profits are affected by any change in underlying investment returns.
When interest rates change, expected future investment returns will also change and this in turn will affect projected cash ows.
A change in investment assumptions may also result in a change to the risk discount rate used to calculate the present value of the projected cash ows.

Principal assumptions The table below sets out the principal economic assumptions used in the calculation of the value of the existing business and the contribution from new business.
31 December 31 December 31 December 2004 2003 2002 %%% Risk discount rate 7.1 7.3 7.0 Investment returns before tax: Fixed interest 4.1 5.2 4.8 5.5 4.5 5.5 Equities 7.1 7.3 7.0 Properties 7.1 7.3 7.0 Future expense ination 3.9 3.9 3.3 Corporation tax rate 30 30 30 Future bonus rates have been set at levels which would fully utilise the assets supporting the in-force with profits business over its lifetime, after providing for an estimate of the cost of guaranteed benets calculated on a stochastic basis, and are consistent with the economic assumptions and the companys bonus policy.
The assumed rates of mortality, morbidity, lapse, surrender, conversion to paid-up and early retirement, which are reviewed annually, have been derived from analyses of the Groups recent operating experience and industry studies.
In particular, improvements in annuitant mortality have been assumed to follow the medium cohort for males and 75% of this for females.
Maintenance expenses are assumed to increase in the future at a rate of 1% per annum in excess of the assumed long-term rate of retail price ination.
Allowance for commission is based on the Groups recent experience.
The value of existing business makes no allowance for the payment of future premiums on recurring single premium contracts except for stakeholder style pensions in which case, if a regular pattern in the receipt of premiums is established, the business is treated as regular premium business or for non-contractual increments on existing policies.
Contingent liabilities Past sales During 2004 there has been a considerable increase in the number of complaints received by the industry in respect of endowment policies.
All such complaints received by the Group, and an estimate of complaints not yet received, have been provided for at the latest estimate of the likely costs of settling such complaints.
In addition, a provision has been established for potential liabilities in respect of inheritance tax planning policies.
Future regulatory actions or statements could change the estimated costs.
The impact of such potential future actions cannot be estimated with reliability.
The FSA and other regulatory bodies may wish, in future, to examine the suitability of past sales of other products which could affect Friends Provident and the industry in general.
The directors of FPLP also conduct ongoing reviews of such products.
As a result, it is possible that additional unprovided liabilities could arise.
Provisions for liabilities in connection with policyholder contracts are based on best estimate assumptions, using historical experience but adjusted where there is reasonable cause to expect future experience to be different.
However, actual experience may differ from that assumed.
Regulatory action, legal judgments, future economic conditions or other unforeseen events may impact ultimate settlements made.
VAT In a current UK VAT Tribunal appeal, a UK investment trust is seeking to establish that management services to UK investment trusts should be a VAT exempt supply, rather than a taxable supply in accordance with current UK VAT law.
If this appeal were successful at the higher UK or European courts, a number of group companies, in common with other relevant fund managers in the UK, would face claims from those investment trusts to which they have supplied services for repayment of the VAT they have charged to them.
At present, the directors of F&C Asset Management plc are not able to judge the likelihood that the VAT Tribunal appeal will be successful, nor are they able to quantify the claims that may be received or the extent to which such claims could be mitigated and therefore are not able to quantify the potential liability.

Contingent liabilities continued F&C acquisition In December 2000, when Eureko B. V. acquired F&C Group Holdings Limited, approximately 73 per cent of the ordinary issued shares of F&C Group Management Limited, a subsidiary company, was held in the form of two bearer share warrants which could not be located prior to the completion of the sale.
Eureko B. V. was indemnified by F&C Group Holdings Limited against any losses suffered as a result of the loss of the old share warrants or the issue of replacement share warrants.
Since a bearer share warrant issued by a company entitles the bearer to the shares specified in the share warrant, there is a risk that a third party holding the old share warrants may claim that it is entitled to the specified shares in F&C Group Management Limited.
If a third party were successful in establishing a claim in relation to the old share warrants, F&C Group Holdings Limited could be liable to indemnify F&C Group Management Limited under the original indemnity arrangements, which could, as set out below, have a material adverse effect on the F&C Asset Management Groups business, results of operations and or financial condition.
Although there is a possibility that a third party may seek to establish that it is entitled to the shares specified in the old share warrants, the directors of F&C Asset Management plc have been informed that Eureko B. V. has been advised that the prospect of a third party succeeding in such a claim is remote.
Under the terms of the 2004 merger between ISIS and F&C, Eureko Holdings has given a specic indemnity guaranteed by Eureko B. V. to F&C Asset Management plc in respect of losses arising in relation to the lost share warrants to bearer in F&C Group Management Limited including in respect of the indemnity granted by F&C Group Holdings Limited to F&C Group Management Limited which is capped at approximately 432m.
