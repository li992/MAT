143 TAXATIONINFORMATION FOR SHAREHOLDERS The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the Groups understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US federal income tax law and practice relevant to the ADSs and Ordinary Shares not in ADS form.
The comments address the material US and UK tax consequences generally applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or Ordinary Shares and who, for US federal income tax purposes, is a US citizen or resident, a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, or an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes each a US Holder.
The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or Ordinary Shares which may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% or more of the issued Ordinary Shares.
This discussion does not apply to persons operating clearance and or depository services and those whose holdingofADSs orOrdinaryShares iseffectively  toeither i a permanent establishment in the United Kingdom through which a US Holder carries on a business in the United Kingdom, or ii a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal services in the United Kingdom.
This discussion does not apply to certain investors such as tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, broker-dealers, traders in securities that elect to mark to market, US Holders holding ADSs or Ordinary Shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other integrated transaction or whose functional currency is other than the US Dollar and investors liable for alternative minimum tax.
In addition, the comments below do not address US state, local or non-US other than UK taxes.
The summary deals only with US Holders who hold ADSs or Ordinary Shares as capital assets.
The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect.
US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisors as to the  ownershipofADSs orOrdinaryShares.
This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms.
For the purpose of the US UK Double Taxation Treaty the Treaty and the prior US UK Double Taxation Treaty the Prior Treaty and US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be treated as owners of the Ordinary Shares represented by the ADSs.
However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom depositary shares are pre-released may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of ADSs.
Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, described below, applicable to dividends received by certain noncorporate US Holders.
Accordingly, the analysis of the creditability of UK taxes, described below, and the availability of the reduced tax rate for dividends received by certain noncorporate US Holders could be affected by future actions that may be taken by parties to whomADSs are pre-released.
Taxation of Dividendsin the United Kingdom and the United States Under the Prior Treaty, certain US Holders who are the beneficial owners of dividends on Ordinary Shares or ADSs were generally entitled to a tax credit payment in respect of dividends equal to one-ninth of the dividend paid the Tax Credit Amount.
This tax credit payment is reduced by a UK withholding the UK withholding of upto15% ofthe gross dividendpaid.
Under the Treaty, US Holders are no longer entitled to the Tax Credit Amount because the Treaty does not provide for that entitlement.
Furthermore, the UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK corporation.
The Treaty applies to dividend payments after 1 May 2003.
However, if a US Holder would have been entitled to greater benefits under the Prior Treaty, the US Holder may elect to continue to apply the .
Dividends paid and, if a US Holder elects under the PriorTreaty to claim a foreign tax credit with respect to the UK withholding, the associated Tax Credit Amount will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary income to a US Holder when the dividend is received to the extent paid out of the Companys current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes.
Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deductiongenerally allowed to corporateUS Holders.
Theamountof the dividend which is includible in taxable income of a US Holder is the US Dollar value of the dividend, converted using the exchange rate on the date the depositary receives the dividend in the case of ADSs, or the date the US Holder receives the dividend in the case of Ordinary Shares.
Conversion by a US Holder of Sterling received as a dividend into US Dollars may result in US source ordinary income to the US Holder to the extent attributable to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the date of receipt, as discussed in the previous sentence, andthe date ofconversion.
144 Dividends paid to certain noncorporate US Holders of Ordinary Shares or ADSs in taxable years beginning before 1 January 2009 may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than other types of ordinary income if certain conditions are met.
Noncorporate US Holders should consult their own tax advisors to determine whether theyare subject toanyspecial rulesthat  taxed at thisfavourable rate.
The limitation of foreign taxes eligible for the foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income.
The UK withholding tax under the Prior Treaty is treated as foreign income tax which may, subject to certain limitations and restrictions, be eligible for credit against a US Holders US federal income tax liability for a US Holder that elects to include the associated Tax Credit Amount in income.
US Holders should consulttheirowntax advisors regardingthe  credits .
Taxation of Capital Gains US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares unless held in connection with a trade carried on in the UK through a permanent establishment or in the case of individuals through a branch or agency.
Furthermore, UK resident individuals who acquire ADSs or Ordinary Shares before becoming temporarily non-UK resident, may remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains on gainsrealised whilenon-resident.
For US federal income tax purposes, gains realised upon the sale or disposition of ADSs or Ordinary Shares by US Holders generally will be US source capital gains and will be long-term US source capital gains if the ADSs or OrdinaryShares .
Inheritance and Estate Taxes The UK Inland Revenue imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death.
The UK Inland Revenue considers that the US UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance tax.
Consequently, a US citizen who is domiciled in the United States and is not a UK national or domiciled in the United Kingdom will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares.
A UK national who is domiciled in the United States will be subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled to a credit for US federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the liability to UK inheritance tax.
Conversely, a US citizen who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the United Kingdom will be entitled to a credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and Ordinary Shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax.
Special rules apply where ADSs and Ordinary Shares are business property of a permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the United Kingdom.
US Information Reporting and Backup WithholdingTax A US Holder may be subject to US information reporting and backup withholding tax on dividends paid or the proceeds of sales made within the US or through certain US-related financial intermediaries, unless the shareholder is a corporation or other exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met.
US backup withholding tax may also apply if there has been a notification from the US Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends.
Backup withholding tax deducted may be credited against the US Holders US federal income tax liability, and, where the withholding tax exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refundclaimwiththe US InternalRevenue Service.
UK Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty ReserveTax UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the transfer of registered ownership of Ordinary Shares.
Transfers of Ordinary Shares will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of % of the  transfer withthe dutyroundeduptothe nearest 5ifnecessary.
UK stamp duty reserve tax SDRT arises when there is an agreement to transfer shares in UK companies for consideration in money or moneys worth, and so an agreement to transfer Ordinary Shares for money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of % rounded up to the nearest penny.
If an instrument of transfer of the Ordinary Shares is subsequently executed, the instrument of transfer will generally be subject to stamp duty.
The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six years of the agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to the United Kingdom Inland Revenue andthe appropriate stamp dutypaid.
145 Transfers of Ordinary Shares into CREST an electronic transfer system are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST who will hold the Ordinary Shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer isina formthat willensurethat the .
Paperless transfers of Ordinary Shares within CREST for consideration in money or moneys worth are liable to SDRT rather than stamp duty.
SDRT on relevant transactions will be collected by CREST at %, and this will apply whether or not the transfer is effected in the United Kingdom and whether or not the parties to it are resident or situated in the United Kingdom.
1 A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rates of 1 2% of the consideration or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned will arise on a transfer or issue of Ordinary Shares to the Depositary or to certain persons providing a clearance service or their nominees or agents and will generally be payable by the Depositary or person providing clearance service.
In accordance with the terms of the Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable by the Depositary on deposits of Ordinary Shares will be charged by the Depositary to the party to whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits.
No liability for SDRT will arise on any agreement to transfer anADS orbeneficialinterest inanADS.
No liability for stamp duty will arise on any transfer of, oragreement totransfer, anADS  an ADS, provided that the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the United Kingdom, and provided further that any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the United Kingdom and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be done in the United Kingdom the location of the custodian as a holder of Ordinary Shares not being relevant in this context.
In any other case, any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, dependingonall the circumstancesofthe transfer, giverisetoa chargetostamp duty.
