38 Directors Report continued A resolution will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to authorise the Directors to allot and grant rights over the unissued share capital and to authorise the Directors to allot and grant rights over Ordinary shares for cash up to a maximum nominal amount representing 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital, without first making a pro rata offer to all existing Ordinary shareholders.
A special resolution will also be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to authorise the Company to purchase up to 15% of its Ordinary shares at or between the minimum and maximum prices specified in the resolution set out in the notice of meeting.
The authority would only be exercised by the Directors if they considered it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally and if the purchase could be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share.
Fixed assets The Directors have considered the market value of land and buildings and are satisfied that it is not less than the net book value.
Payment of suppliers The Company and its subsidiaries agree terms and conditions for their business transactions with their suppliers.
Payment is then made on these terms, subject to the terms and conditions being met by the supplier.
Given the diversity of the Groups businesses and the widely differing credit terms which apply in the various industries and territories in which they operate, the Directors consider that it is not meaningful to disclose an average period of credit taken.
The Company has no trade creditors.
