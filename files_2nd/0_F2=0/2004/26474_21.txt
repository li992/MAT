The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the holding companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
Turnover Turnover represents the total amount receivable for the provision of goods and services, excluding value added tax.
Turnover is recognised in the period when the service or supply is provided: a annual fees are recognised over the 12 month period to which the fee relates b admission fees are recognised at the time of admission to trading c data, transaction and Exchange charges are recognised in the month in which the data is provided or the transaction is effected.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies and currency balances at the year end are converted at the rate ruling at the transaction date or year end date respectively, except where covered by an open foreign exchange contract when the contract rate is used.
Intangible assets Intangible assets represent goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, being the excess of consideration paid over the fair value of net assets acquired.
Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Tangible assets and depreciation a Freehold properties, including related fixed plant, have been revalued by external chartered surveyors and are included in the financial statements at the revalued amounts.
Following the implementation of FRS 15 no revaluations of freehold properties after March 1997 have been made.
Freehold buildings and related fixed plant are depreciated, based on cost or valuation at the beginning of the year plus subsequent additions, over their estimated economic lives.
The economic lives of properties range from 15 to 50 years, the estimated useful lives of fixed plant range from five to 20 years.
b Leasehold properties and improvements are included at cost and depreciated over the shorter of the period of the lease or the economic life of the property.
c Plant and equipment is stated at cost and is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are mainly in the range from three to five years.
Third party software costs for the development and implementation of systems which enhance the services provided by the Company are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives, which is an average of three years.
d The Group selects its depreciation rates based on expected economic lives, taking into account the expected rate of technological developments, market requirements and expected use of the assets.
The selected rates are regularly reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate to the Groups circumstances.
Joint ventures The Groups share of profits, less losses, from joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account and the Groups share of gross assets and gross liabilities underlying the net equity amount is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
Fixed asset investments Shares in the Company held under Employee Share Ownership Plans are stated at cost less amortisation.
The cost of these shares is written down to realisable value over the periods of service in respect of which options and awards are granted.
Other fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any provision required for impairment in value.
Provisions A provision is recognised where there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Operating leases Rental costs for operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account when incurred.
Provision is made in the accounts for lease commitments, less income from sub-letting, for property space which is surplus to business requirements.

Accounting policies continued Pension costs Pension costs for the defined benefit plan are assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary.
The accounting cost for providing defined benefit pensions is charged over the period during which the Company benefits from the services of employees.
The cost is calculated so as to produce a substantially level percentage of the current and future pensionable payroll.
Pension costs under the defined contribution plan are charged as incurred.
Further details of the Companys pension schemes and the basis upon which the charge to the profit and loss account is determined are set out in note 25 to the financial statements.
Deferred taxation Full provision is made for the future tax consequences of past transactions and events.
The timing differences are recognised as deferred tax liabilities or assets in the financial statements, measured at expected future tax rates.
No discounting of the deferred tax liabilities or assets is applied.

Pension costs The Company operates one pension plan which includes separate defined benefit and defined contribution schemes.
The assets of the defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are held separately from those of the Company and the funds are managed by Schroder Investment Management Limited and Legal & General Investment Management Limited respectively.
Defined benefit scheme The defined benefit scheme is non-contributory and provides benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Pension costs are determined by an independent qualified actuary on the basis of regular valuations using the projected unit method and are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Company.
A full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out at 31 March 2003 by an independent qualified actuary.
The market value of the plans assets for the scheme was 159m, representing 88 per cent of the value of benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in salaries.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The main assumptions for the 31 March 2003 valuation were an investment return of 5 per cent per annum for pension payments in the next 30 years and 7.5 per cent per annum for pension payments thereafter, salary increases of 4.5 per cent per annum and pension increases of 3.7 per cent per annum.
Defined contribution scheme The Companys defined contribution scheme is now the only scheme open to new employees.
A core contribution of eight per cent of pensionable pay is provided and the Company will match employee contributions up to a maximum of six per cent of pensionable pay.
Pension contributions The contribution rate for the defined benefit scheme for 2004 was 23 per cent of pensionable salaries 2003: 31.2 per cent of pensionable salaries less 1.1m amortisation of the actuarial surplus at 31 March 2000.
As the defined benefit scheme is closed to new members, under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as a percentage of pensionable salaries as members approach retirement.
In addition to the normal contributions to the defined benefit scheme, the Company made additional contributions of 3.2m 2003: 15.0m during the year.
These additional contributions are treated as a prepayment in the accounts and are charged to the profit and loss account over the expected remaining service lives of scheme members.
The pension charge for the year ended 31 March 2004 was: 2004 2003 m m Defined benefit contribution 1.3 1.0 Release of pension provision 0.2 Amortisation of additional contributions 3.1 Defined contribution costs 2.4 2.0 Total pension charge 6.8 2.8 62 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNUAL REPORT 2004 Financial Reporting Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benefits The Company continues to account for pension costs in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The following information is provided under the disclosure requirements of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
The Accounting Standards Board has deferred the full adoption of FRS 17 until implementation of International Accounting Standards in 2005.
The costs for the defined contribution scheme are unchanged by FRS 17 and are as set out above.
Defined benefit valuation An actuarial review was carried out at 31 March 2002, 2003 and 2004 by an independent qualified actuary to provide the information required by FRS 17.

The plans assets are invested approximately 26 per cent in equities and 74 per cent in bonds at 31 March 2004 and the trustees of the plan intend to move gradually to 100 per cent investment in bonds over the longer term.
Defined benefit charges to the profit and loss account On the basis required by FRS 17, the charges would be as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 2004 31 March 2003 m m Current service cost 1.7 1.9 Other service costs Total costs 1.7 1.9 Finance income and costs Interest cost, being the expected increase in the present value of scheme liabilities 10.0 10.0 Expected return on assets in the scheme 8.8 9.0 Net finance cost 1.2 1.0 LONDON STOCK EXCHANGE ANNUAL REPORT 2004 NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT 63 Notes to the Financial Statements 25.

Transactions with related parties During the financial year, no contracts of significance were entered into by the Company or any of its subsidiaries in which the directors had a material interest.
FTSE International Ltd Details of transactions with FTSE International Ltd are included in note 13.
Financial assets and liabilities The Company has defined financial assets and liabilities as those assets and liabilities of a financial nature, namely cash, investments and borrowings.
Short-term debtors and creditors are excluded.
The majority of the Companys financial assets and liabilities are based in sterling with some exposure to Scandinavian currencies in Derivatives Services, which are mainly hedged by forward exchange contracts.
The main risks arising from the Companys financial instruments are in respect of interest rate, credit, liquidity and exchange rate.
Interest rate management There are no floating rate financial assets or liabilities.
Term deposits with banks are for fixed rates for the period of the deposit.
Liquidity and credit management The Company manages liquidity risk by depositing funds available for investment in approved instruments for periods up to one year.
Counterparty risk is managed by establishing minimum credit worthiness limits and limiting the maximum exposure to each counterparty.
Exchange rate management The only derivative contracts used during the year were to hedge forecast cash inflows in Scandinavian currencies.
All contracts were closed out on or before the final contract dates and fully matched with equivalent currency cash holdings.
