In preparing those accounts, the directors are required: To select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
To make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
To state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the accounts.
To prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group will continue in business.
The directors are also responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the group and enable them to ensure that the accounts comply with the Companies Act 1985.
They are also responsible for taking reasonable steps to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The directors confirm that they have complied with these requirements, and having a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.

52 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004 12 Taxation continued Factors that may affect future tax charges From 1 January 2005, the group has adopted International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
As a consequence, there will be a change in the basis of providing deferred taxation in such areas as business combinations and the valuation of stock, which will lead to changes to certain of the factors described below and may lead to a change in the groups effective tax rate.
The group earns income in many different countries and, on average, pays taxes at rates higher than the UK statutory rate.
The overall impact of these higher taxes, which include the supplementary charge of 10% on UK North Sea profits, is subject to changes in enacted tax rates and the country mix of the groups income.
However, it is not expected to change significantly in the near term.
The group has around $7.7 billion $4.5 billion of carry-forward tax losses in the UK and Germany, which would be available to offset against future taxable income.
At the end of 2004, no tax assets were recognized on these losses at the end of 2003, $285 million of assets were recognized.
Tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is considered more likely than not that suitable taxable income will arise.
Carry-forward losses in other taxing jurisdictions have not been recognized as deferred tax assets, and are unlikely to have a significant effect on the groups tax rate in future years.
The groups profit before taxation includes stock holding gains or losses.
These gains or losses are not taxed or deductible in certain jurisdictions in which the group operates, and therefore give rise to decreases or increases in the effective tax rate.
The impact of this item will be reduced under IFRS.
The impact on the tax rate of acquisition amortization non-deductible depreciation and amortization relating to the fixed asset revaluation adjustments and goodwill consequent upon the ARCO and Burmah Castrol acquisitions is likely to be eliminated when the group reports its results under IFRS.
The major component of timing differences in the current year is accelerated tax depreciation.
Based on current capital investment plans, the group expects to continue to be able to claim tax allowances in excess of depreciation in future years at a level similar to the current year.

The profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is $15,729 million $10,480 million.
The average number of shares outstanding excludes the shares held by the Employee Share Ownership Plans.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on profit attributable to ordinary shareholders, adjusted for the unwinding of the discount on the deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP, of $15,793 million $10,504 million.
The number of shares outstanding is adjusted to show the potential dilution if employee share options are converted into ordinary shares, and for the ordinary shares issuable, in two further annual tranches, in respect of the TNK-BP joint venture.
The number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share may be reconciled as follows: shares thousand 2004 2003 Weighted average number of ordinary shares 21,820,535 22,170,741 Potential dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable under employee share schemes 74,775 71,651 Potential dilutive effect of ordinary shares issuable as consideration for BPs interest in the TNK-BP joint venture 415,016 186,980 22,310,326 22,429,372 In addition to basic earnings per share based on the historical cost profit for the year, a further measure, based on replacement cost profit for the year, is provided as it is considered that this measure gives an indication of underlying performance.

Solvay held 50% of BP Solvay Polyethylene Europe and 51% of BP Solvay Polyethylene North America.
On completion, the two entities, which manufacture and market high-density polyethylene, became wholly owned subsidiaries of BP.
The total consideration for the acquisition was $1,391 million.
The consideration is subject to final closing adjustments.
Other minor acquisitions were made for a total consideration of $14 million.
All business combinations have been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The fair value of the tangible fixed assets has been estimated by determining the net present value of future cash flows.
No significant adjustments were made to the other assets and liabilities acquired.
The assets and liabilities acquired as part of the 2004 acquisitions are shown in aggregate in the table above.
During the year, BP China and Sinopec announced the establishment of the BP-Sinopec Zhejiang Petroleum Co. Ltd, a retail joint venture between BP and Sinopec.
Based on the existing service station network of Sinopec, the new joint venture will build, operate and manage a network of 500 service stations in Hangzhou, Ningbo and Shaoxing.
Also during the year, BP China and PetroChina announced the establishment of BP-PetroChina Petroleum Company Limited.
Located in Guangdong, one of the most developed provinces in China, the joint venture will acquire, build, operate and manage 500 service stations in the province.
The initial investment in both joint ventures amounted to $106 million.
Acquisitions in 2003 BP made a number of minor acquisitions in 2003 for a total consideration of $82 million.
All these business combinations were accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
No significant fair value adjustments were made to the acquired assets and liabilities.
Goodwill of $5 million arose on these acquisitions.
In addition, the group redeemed the outstanding stock in CH-Twenty, Inc. a subsidiary undertaking, for $150 million.
TNK-BP On 29 August 2003, BP and the Alfa Group and Access-Renova AAR combined certain of their Russian and Ukranian oil and gas businesses to create TNK-BP, a new company owned and managed 50:50 by BP and AAR.
TNK-BP is a joint venture and accounted for under the gross equity method.
BP contributed its 29% interest in Sidanco, its 29% interest in Rusia Petroleum and its holding in the BP Moscow retail network.
There was additional consideration from BP to AAR comprising an immediate $2,604 million in cash which was subsequently reduced by receipt of pre-acquisition dividends net of other adjustments, of $298 million together with annual tranches of $1,250 million in BP shares payable in 2004, 2005 and 2006.
There were costs of $45 million in connection with the transaction.
The first tranche was issued in September 2004.
BP also agreed with AAR to incorporate AARs 50% interest in Slavneft into TNK-BP in return for $1,418 million in cash which was subsequently reduced by receipt of pre-acquisition dividends of $64 million to $1,354 million.
This transaction was completed on 16 January 2004.
55 Notes on accounts 17 Disposals As part of the strategy to upgrade the quality of its asset portfolio, the group has an active programme to dispose of non-strategic assets.
In the normal course of business in any particular year, the group may sell interests in exploration and production properties, service stations and pipeline interests as well as non-core businesses.
Disposal proceeds also include monies received from the repayment of loans.
Cash received during the year from disposals amounted to $5.0 billion $6.4 billion.
The major transactions in 2004 which generated over $2.3 billion of proceeds were the sale of the groups investments in PetroChina and Sinopec.
For 2003, the major disposals representing over $3.0 billion of the proceeds were the divestment of a further 20% interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC: the sale of 50% of our interest in the In Amenas gas condensate project and 49% of our interest in the In Salah gas development in Algeria: and the sale of the UK North Sea Forties oil field, together with a package of 61 shallow-water assets in the Gulf of Mexico.
The principal transactions generating the proceeds for each segment are described below.
Exploration and Production $921 million $4,867 million The group divested interests in a number of oil and natural gas properties in both years.
During 2004, in the US we sold 45% of our interest in Kings Peak in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico to Marubeni Oil & Gas: divested our interest in Swordfish: and additionally, we sold various properties including our interest in the South Pass 60 property in the Gulf of Mexico Shelf.
In Canada, BP sold various assets in Alberta to Fairborne Energy.
In Indonesia, we disposed of our interest in the Kangean Production Sharing Contract and our participating interest in the Muriah Production Sharing Contract.
In 2003, the UK North Sea Forties oil field, together with a package of 61 shallowwater assets in the Gulf of Mexico, were sold to Apache.

Interests in 14 UK Southern North Sea gas fields, together with associated pipelines and onshore processing facilities, including the Bacton terminal, were sold to Perenco.
BP sold 50% of its interest in the In Amenas gas condensate project and 49% of its interest in the In Salah gas development in Algeria to Statoil.
In January 2003, Repsol exercised its option to acquire a further 20% interest in BP Trinidad and Tobago LLC.
BPs interest in the company is now 70%.
In February 2003, BP called its $420 million Exchangeable Bonds which were exchangeable for Lukoil American Depositary Shares ADSs.
Bondholders converted to ADSs before the redemption date.
Refining and Marketing $906 million $1,053 million The churn of retail assets represents a significant element of the total in both years.
In addition, for 2004, major asset transactions included the sale of the Singapore refinery, and the Cushing and other pipeline interests in the US.
As a condition of the approval of the acquisition of Veba in 2002, BP was, among other things, required to divest approximately 4% of its retail market share in Germany and a significant portion of its Bayernoil refining interests.
The sale of 494 retail sites in the northern and north-eastern part of Germany to PKN Orlen and the sale of retail and refinery assets in Germany and Central Europe to OMV in 2003 completed the divestments required.
Petrochemicals $717 million $236 million In 2004, these related principally to the sale of the speciality intermediate chemicals and fabrics and fibres businesses.
For 2003, the proceeds related to the completion of the divestment of the former Burmah Castrol speciality chemicals business Sericol and Fosroc Mining.
Gas, Power and Renewables $144 million $67 million In 2004, the group sold its interest in two Canadian natural gas liquids plants.

Financial instruments comprise primary financial instruments cash, fixed and current asset investments, debtors, creditors, finance debt and provisions and derivative financial instruments interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, oil price contracts, natural gas price contracts and power price contracts.
Interest rate contracts include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Foreign exchange contracts include forwards, futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts are those that require settlement in cash and include futures contracts, swap agreements and options.
Oil, natural gas and power price contracts that require physical delivery are not financial instruments.
However, if it is normal market practice for a particular type of oil, natural gas and power contract, despite having contract terms that require settlement by delivery, to be extinguished other than by physical delivery e. g. by cash payment, it is called a cash-settled commodity contract.
Contracts of this type are included with derivatives in the disclosures in Notes 26 and 27.
With the exception of the table of currency exposures shown on page 61, short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the groups operations have been excluded from the disclosures contained in this note, as permitted by Financial Reporting Standard No.

The proportion of floating rate debt at 31 December 2004 was 96% of total finance debt outstanding.
Aside from debt issued in the US municipal bond markets, interest rates on floating rate debt denominated in US dollars are linked principally to London Inter-Bank Offer Rate LIBOR, while rates on debt in other currencies are based on local market equivalents.
The group monitors interest rate risk using a process of sensitivity analysis.
Assuming no changes to the finance debt and hedges described above, it is estimated that a change of 1% in the general level of interest rates on 1 January 2005 would change 2005 profit before tax by approximately $215 million.
61 Notes on accounts 25 Financial instruments continued Interest rate swaps and futures are used by the group to modify the interest characteristics of its long-term finance debt from a fixed to a floating rate basis or vice versa.

Fixed asset investments included in the table above are held for the long term and have no maturity period.
They are excluded from the calculation of weighted average time until maturity.
26 Derivative financial instruments In the normal course of business, the group is a party to derivative financial instruments derivatives with off balance sheet risk, primarily to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including management of the balance between floating rate and fixed rate debt.
The group also manages certain of its exposures to movements in oil, natural gas and power prices.
In addition, the group trades derivatives in conjunction with these risk management activities.
Risk management Gains and losses on derivatives used for risk management purposes are deferred and recognized in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts, as appropriate, when the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs.
When an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur or finance debt is terminated before maturity, any deferred gain or loss that has arisen on the related derivative is recognized in the income statement, together with any gain or loss on the terminated item.
Where such derivatives used for hedging purposes are terminated before the underlying debt matures or the hedged transaction occurs, the resulting gain or loss is recognized on a basis that matches the timing and accounting treatment of the underlying hedged item.
The unrecognized and carried-forward gains and losses on derivatives used for hedging, and the movements therein, are shown in the following table.

This activity is undertaken in conjunction with risk management activities.
Derivatives held for trading purposes are marked-to-market and any gain or loss recognized in the income statement.
For traded derivatives, many positions have been neutralized, with trading initiatives being concluded by taking opposite positions to fix a gain or loss, thereby achieving a zero net market risk.
The following table shows the fair value at 31 December of derivatives and other financial instruments held for trading purposes.
The fair values at the year end are not materially unrepresentative of the position throughout the year.

These techniques are based on a variance covariance model or a Monte Carlo simulation and make a statistical assessment of the market risk arising from possible future changes in market values over a 24-hour period.
The calculation of the range of potential changes in fair value takes into account a snapshot of the end-of-day exposures, and the history of one-day price movements over the previous 12 months, together with the correlation of these price movements.
The potential movement in fair values is expressed to three standard deviations, which is equivalent to a 99.7% confidence level.
This means that, in broad terms, one would expect to see an increase or a decrease in fair values greater than the value at risk on only one occasion per year if the portfolio were left unchanged.
The group calculates value at risk on all instruments that are held for trading purposes and that therefore give an exposure to market risk.
The value-at-risk model takes account of derivative financial instruments such as interest rate forward and futures contracts, swap agreements, options and swaptions: foreign exchange forward and futures contracts, swap agreements and options: and oil, natural gas and power price futures, swap agreements and options.
Financial assets and liabilities and physical crude oil and refined products that are treated as trading positions are also included in these calculations.
The value-at-risk calculation for oil, natural gas and power price exposure also includes cash-settled commodity contracts such as forward contracts.
The following table shows values at risk for trading activities.

The fair value of listed fixed asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Current assets Debtors falling due after more than one year The fair value of other debtors due after one year is estimated not to be materially different from its carrying value.
Current assets Investments and cash at bank and in hand The carrying amount reported in the balance sheet for unlisted current asset investments and cash at bank and in hand approximates their fair value.
The fair value of listed current asset investments has been determined by reference to market prices.
Finance debt The carrying amount of the groups short-term borrowings, which mainly comprise commercial paper, bank loans and overdrafts, approximates their fair value.
The fair value of the groups long-term borrowings and finance lease obligations is estimated using quoted prices or, where these are not available, discounted cash flow analyses, based on the groups current incremental borrowing rates for similar types and maturities of borrowing.
Creditors Amounts falling due after more than one year Other creditors Deferred consideration for the acquisition of our interest in TNK-BP is discounted to the present value of the future payments.
The carrying value thus approximates the fair value.
The remaining liabilities are predominantly interest-free.
In view of their short maturities, the reported carrying amount is estimated to approximate the fair value.
Provisions for liabilities and charges Other provisions Where the liability will not be settled for a number of years, the amount recognized is the present value of the estimated future expenditure.
The carrying amount of provisions thus approximates the fair value.
Derivative financial instruments and cash-settled commodity contracts The fair values of the groups interest rate and foreign exchange contracts are based on pricing models that take into account relevant market data.
The fair values of the groups oil, natural gas and power price contracts futures contracts, swap agreements, options and forward contracts are based on market prices.

Total finance debt includes an asset of $835 million $745 million for the carrying value of currency swaps and forward contracts.
Included within Other loans repayable within one year are US Industrial Revenue Municipal Bonds of $2,487 million $2,503 million with maturity periods ranging up to 34 years.
They are classified as repayable within one year, as required under UK GAAP, as the bondholders typically have the option to tender these bonds for repayment on interest reset dates.
Any bonds that are tendered are usually remarketed and BP has not experienced any significant repurchases.
BP considers these bonds to represent long-term funding when assessing the maturity profile of its finance debt.
At 31 December 2004, the group had substantial amounts of undrawn borrowing facilities available, including committed facilities of $4,500 million expiring in 2005 $3,700 million expiring in 2004.
These facilities are with a number of international banks and borrowings under them would be at pre-agreed rates.
The group expects to renew the facilities on an annual basis.
Certain of these facilities support the groups commercial paper programme.
At 31 December 2004, the groups share of third-party finance debt of joint ventures and associated undertakings was $2,821 million $2,151 million and $1,048 million $922 million respectively.
These amounts are not reflected in the groups debt on the balance sheet.
The weighted average interest rate on finance debt is 3%.

At 31 December 2004, the provision for the costs of decommissioning these production facilities and pipelines at the end of their economic lives was $5,580 million $4,720 million.
The provision has been estimated using existing technology, at current prices and discounted using a real discount rate of 2.0% 2.5%.
These costs are expected to be incurred over the next 30 years.
While the provision is based on the best estimate of future costs and the economic lives of the facilities and pipelines, there is uncertainty regarding both the amount and timing of incurring these costs.
Provisions for environmental remediation are made when a clean-up is probable and the amount reasonably determinable.
Generally, this coincides with commitment to a formal plan of action or, if earlier, on divestment or closure of inactive sites.
The provision for environmental liabilities at 31 December 2004 was $2,458 million $2,298 million.
The majority of these costs are expected to be incurred over the next 10 years.
The extent and cost of future remediation programmes are inherently difficult to estimate.
They depend on the scale of any possible contamination, the timing and extent of corrective actions, and also the groups share of liability.
The group also holds provisions for expected rental shortfalls on surplus properties, litigation and sundry other liabilities.
To the extent that these liabilities are not expected to be settled within the next three years, the provisions are discounted using either a nominal discount rate of 4.5% 4.5% or a real discount rate of 2.0% 2.5%, as appropriate.
31 Pensions Most group companies have pension plans, the forms and benefits of which vary with conditions and practices in the countries concerned.
Pension benefits may be provided through defined contribution plans money purchase schemes or defined benefit plans final salary and other types of schemes with committed pension payments.
For defined contribution plans, retirement benefits are determined by the value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee.
For defined benefit plans, retirement benefits are based on such factors as the employees pensionable salary and length of service.
Defined benefit plans may be externally funded or unfunded.
The assets of funded plans are generally held in separately administered trusts.
Contributions to funded defined benefit plans are based on advice from independent actuaries using actuarial methods, the objective of which is to provide adequate funds to meet pension obligations as they fall due.
The pension plans in the UK and US are reviewed annually by the independent actuaries and subject to a formal actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The date of the latest actuarial valuation for the UK and US plans was 1 January 2003 and 1 January 2004 respectively.
The date of the most recent actuarial reviews was 31 December 2004.
During 2004, contributions of $249 million $258 million and $30 million $2,189 million were made to the UK plans and US plans respectively.
In addition, contributions of $116 million $86 million were made to other funded defined benefit plans.
The aggregate level of contributions in 2005 is expected to be approximately $600 million.
67 Notes on accounts 31 Pensions continued The pension assumptions for the principal plans are set out below.
The assumptions used to evaluate accrued pension benefits at 31 December in any year are used to determine pension expense for the following year, that is, the assumptions at 31 December 2004 are used to determine the pension liabilities at that date and the pension cost for 2005.
The assumptions for the parent company are the same as those shown for the UK.
A one-percentage-point change in these assumptions for the groups plans would have had the following effects: $ million One-percentage point Increase Decrease Investment return Effect on pension expense in 2005 312 314 Discount rate Effect on pension expense in 2005 87 88 Effect on pension obligation at 31 December 2004 4,508 5,575 The expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of asset held by the significant defined benefit plans at 31 December are set out below.

and life insurance benefits to their retired employees and dependants.
The entitlement to these benefits is usually based on the employee remaining in service until retirement age and completion of a minimum period of service.
The plans are funded to a limited extent.
The cost of providing post-retirement benefits is assessed annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit method.
The date of the latest actuarial valuation was 1 January 2004 and the date of the most recent actuarial review was 31 December 2004.
At 31 December 2004, the independent actuaries reassessed the obligation for post-retirement benefits at $3,676 million $4,143 million.
The discount rate used to assess the obligation at 31 December 2004 of the plans was 5.75% 6.0%.
2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 and subsequent Assumed future healthcare cost trend rate years Beneficiaries aged under 65 9% 8% 7% 6% 5% Beneficiaries aged over 65 12% 10% 8% 7% 6% The assumed healthcare cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.
A one-percentage-point change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would have had the following effects: $ million One-percentage point Increase Decrease Effect on post-retirement benefit expense in 2005 39 31 Effect on post-retirement obligation at 31 December 2004 458 373 BPs post-retirement medical plans in the US provide prescription drug coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees.
The groups obligation for other post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 reflects the effects of the recent Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 the Act.
The provisions of the Act provide for a federal subsidy for plans that provide prescription drug benefits and meet certain qualifications, and alternatively would allow prescription drug plan sponsors to co-ordinate with the Medicare benefit.
BP reflected the impact of the legislation by reducing its actuarially determined obligation for post-retirement benefits at 31 December 2004 and will reduce the net cost for postretirement benefits in subsequent periods.
The reduction in liability was reflected in the 2004 results as an actuarial gain assumption change.
The expected long-term rates of return and market values of the various categories of assets held by the plans at 31 December are set out below.

BP offers most of its employees the opportunity to acquire a shareholding in the company through savings-related and or matching share plan arrangements.
Such arrangements are now in place in more than 80 countries.
BP also uses long-term performance plans see Note 38 and the granting of share options as elements of remuneration for executive directors and senior employees.
During 2004, share options were granted to the executive directors under the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP.
For these options, the option exercise price was the market value as determined in accordance with the plan rules on the grant date.
The options granted to executive directors reflect BPs performance in terms of total shareholder return, that is, share price increase with all dividends reinvested, relative to the FTSE Global 100 group of companies over the three years preceding the grant as well as the underlying health of the business and the competitive marketplace.
Options have not been granted in any year unless the criteria for an award of shares under the share element of the EDIP see Note 38 have been met.
Options vest over three years one-third each after one, two and three years respectively and have a life of seven years after the grant.
Share options were also granted in 2004 under the BP Share Option Plan to certain categories of employees.
Subject to certain vesting requirements, the options are exercisable between the third and 10th anniversaries of the date of grant.
There are no performance conditions attaching to the options granted during the year.
Under the BP ShareSave Plan a savings-related share option plan, employees save on a monthly basis over a threeor five-year period towards the purchase of shares at a price fixed when the option is granted.
The option price is usually set at a 20% discount to the market price at the time of grant.
The option must be exercised within six months of maturity of the savings contract: otherwise it lapses.
The plan is run in the UK and a small number of other countries.
Under the BP ShareMatch Plan, BP matches employees own contributions of shares, up to a predetermined limit.
The shares are then held in trust for a defined minimum period.
The plan is run in the UK and in over 70 other countries.
The group takes advantage of the exemption granted under Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No.
17 revised 2003 Employee Share Schemes, whereby no compensation expense need be recognized for the BP ShareSave Plan.
BP does not recognize an expense in respect of share options granted to employees under the BP Share Option Plan.
If the fair value of options granted in any particular year is estimated and this value amortized over the vesting period of the options, an indication of the cost of granting options to employees can be made.
The fair value of each share option granted has been estimated using a Black Scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions: 2004 2003 Risk-free interest rate 4.00% 3.5% Expected volatility 22% 30% Expected life in years 1 to 5 1 to 5 Expected dividend yield 3.75% 4.00% Weighted average fair value of options granted $ 1.40 1.44 The additional expense that would have been recognized in 2004 on this basis would be $79 million $79 million and the impact on earnings per share would be 1 cent 1 cent.
The company sponsors a number of savings plans covering most US employees.
Under these plans, most employees may contribute up to 100% of their salary subject to certain regulatory limits.
Most employees are eligible for a dollar-for-dollar company-matched contribution for the first 7% of eligible pay contributed on a before-tax or after-tax basis, or a combination of both.
The precise arrangement may vary in certain business units.
Plan participants may invest contributions in more than 200 investment options, including a fund comprised primarily of BP ADSs.
The companys contributions generally vest over a period of three years 0% for years one and two and 100% after completion of three years.
Company contributions to savings plans during the year were $138 million $130 million.
An Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP was established in 1997 to acquire BP shares to satisfy future requirements of employee share plans, principally the BP ShareMatch Plan.
The ESOP holds the shares for participants during the retention period of the plan.
The company provides funding to the ESOP.
Until such time as the companys own shares held by the ESOP trust vest unconditionally in employees, the amount paid for those shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders interest see Notes 34 and 35.
Other assets and liabilities of the ESOP are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.
The ESOP has waived its rights to dividends.
During 2004, the ESOP released 14,156,047 shares 16,892,853 shares for the matching share plans.
The cost of shares released for these plans has been charged in these accounts.
At 31 December 2004, the ESOP held 2,682,860 shares 7,811,544 shares, which had a market value of $26 million $63 million.

38 Long-term performance plans During 2004, the company operated two long-term performance plans: the Executive Directors Incentive Plan EDIP for executive directors and the Long Term Performance Plan LTPP for senior employees.
Executive directors participated in the LTPP prior to 2002 or to their appointment as an executive director, whichever was the later.
Both plans are incentive schemes under which the company may award shares to participants or fund the purchase of shares for participants if long-term targets are met.
Awards were made in 2004 in respect of the 2001-2003 LTPP.
Further details of the plans are given in the directors remuneration report on pages 116-125.
The costs of potential future awards for both the EDIP and LTPP are accrued over the three-year performance periods of each plan.
The amount charged in 2004 was $89 million $94 million.
The value of awards under the 2001-2003 LTPP made in 2004 was $42 million 2000-2002 LTPP $35 million.
Employees are able to defer the date of their potential award beyond the end of the performance period.
The amount charged in respect of the increase in deferred awards after the expiry of the relevant performance periods was $23 million $17 million.
Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs have been established to acquire BP shares to satisfy any awards made to participants under the EDIP and LTPP and then to hold them for the participants during the retention period of the plan.
The company provides funding to the ESOPs.
Until such time as the companys own shares held by the ESOP trusts vest unconditionally in employees, the amount paid for those shares is deducted in arriving at shareholders interest see Notes 34 and 35.
Other assets and liabilities of the ESOPs are recognized as assets and liabilities of the company.
The ESOPs have waived their rights to dividends on shares held for future awards.
At 31 December 2004, the ESOPs held 5,938,359 shares 4,118,835 shares for potential future awards, which had a market value of $58 million $33 million.

Pension contributions Six executive directors participated in a non-contributory pension scheme established for UK staff by a separate trust fund to which contributions are made by BP based on actuarial advice.
One US executive director participated in the US BP Retirement Accumulation Plan during 2004.
Office facilities for former chairmen and deputy chairmen It is customary for the company to make available to former chairmen and deputy chairmen, who were previously employed executives, the use of office and basic secretarial facilities following their retirement.
The cost involved in doing so is not significant.

79 Notes on accounts 42 Contingent liabilities There were contingent liabilities at 31 December 2004 in respect of guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course of the groups business.
No material losses are likely to arise from such contingent liabilities.
Approximately 200 lawsuits were filed in State and Federal Courts in Alaska seeking compensatory and punitive damages arising out of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound in March 1989.
Most of those suits named Exxon now ExxonMobil, Alyeska Pipeline Service Company Alyeska, which operates the oil terminal at Valdez, and the other oil companies that own Alyeska.
Alyeska initially responded to the spill until the response was taken over by Exxon.
BP owns a 47% interest reduced during 2001 from 50% by a sale of 3% to Phillips in Alyeska through a subsidiary of BP America Inc. and briefly indirectly owned a further 20% interest in Alyeska following BPs combination with Atlantic Richfield Company Atlantic Richfield.
Alyeska and its owners have settled all the claims against them under these lawsuits.
Exxon has indicated that it may file a claim for contribution against Alyeska for a portion of the costs and damages which it has incurred.
If any claims are asserted by Exxon that affect Alyeska and its owners, BP will defend the claims vigorously.
Since 1987, Atlantic Richfield, a current subsidiary of BP, has been named as a co-defendant in numerous lawsuits brought in the US alleging injury to persons and property caused by lead pigment in paint.
The majority of the lawsuits have been abandoned or dismissed as against Atlantic Richfield.
Atlantic Richfield and in one case two of its affiliates is named in these lawsuits as alleged successor to International Smelting & Refining which, along with a predecessor company, manufactured lead pigment during the period 1920-1946.
Plaintiffs include individuals and governmental entities.
Several of the lawsuits purport to be class actions.
The lawsuits depending on plaintiff seek various remedies, including: compensation to lead-poisoned children: cost to find and remove lead paint from buildings: medical monitoring and screening programmes: public warning and education on lead hazards: reimbursement of government healthcare costs and special education for lead-poisoned citizens: and punitive damages.
No lawsuit against Atlantic Richfield has been settled or tried to conclusion.
The amounts claimed and, if such suits were successful, the costs of implementing the remedies sought in the various cases could be substantial.
While it is not possible to predict the outcome of these legal actions, Atlantic Richfield believes that it has valid defences and it intends to defend such actions vigorously and thus the incurring of a liability by Atlantic Richfield is remote.
Consequently, BP believes that the impact of these lawsuits on the groups results of operations, financial position or liquidity will not be material.
The group is subject to numerous national and local environmental laws and regulations concerning its products, operations and other activities.
These laws and regulations may require the group to take future action to remediate the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the group or other parties.
Such contingencies may exist for various sites including refineries, chemical plants, oil fields, service stations, terminals and waste disposal sites.
In addition, the group may have obligations relating to prior asset sales or closed facilities.
The ultimate requirement for remediation and its cost are inherently difficult to estimate.
However, the estimated cost of known environmental obligations has been provided in these accounts in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
While the amounts of future costs could be significant and could be material to the groups results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, BP does not expect these costs to have a material effect on the groups financial position or liquidity.
The group generally restricts its purchase of insurance to situations where this is required for legal or contractual reasons.
This is because external insurance is not considered an economic means of financing losses for the group.
Losses will therefore be borne as they arise rather than being spread over time through insurance premia with attendant transaction costs.
The position is reviewed periodically.
The parent company has issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2004 were $21,106 million $20,903 million, including $21,050 million $20,847 million in respect of borrowings by its subsidiary undertakings and $56 million $56 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
In addition, other group companies have issued guarantees under which amounts outstanding at 31 December 2004 were $1,281 million $635 million in respect of borrowings of joint ventures and associated undertakings and $650 million $304 million in respect of liabilities of other third parties.
43 Capital commitments Authorized future capital expenditure by group companies for which contracts had been placed at 31 December 2004 amounted to $6,765 million $6,420 million.
80 BP Annual Report and Accounts 2004 44 New accounting standards Comparative information for 2003 has been restated to reflect the changes described below: a New accounting standard for pensions and other post-retirement benefits With effect from 1 January 2004, BP has adopted Financial Reporting Standard No.
FRS 17 requires that financial statements reflect at fair value the assets and liabilities arising from an employers retirement benefit obligations and any related funding.
The operating costs of providing retirement benefits are recognized in the period in which they are earned, together with any related finance costs and changes in the value of related assets and liabilities.
This contrasts with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice No.
24 Accounting for Pension Costs, which required the cost of providing pensions to be recognized on a systematic and rational basis over the period during which the employer benefited from the employees services.
The difference between the amount charged in the income statement and the amount paid as contributions into the pension fund was shown as a prepayment or provision on the balance sheet.
This change in accounting policy has resulted in a prior year adjustment.
Shareholders interest at 1 January 2003 has been reduced by $5,601 million and the profit for the year ended 31 December 2003 increased by $215 million.
Profit for the current year has been increased by approximately $301 million as a result of the change in accounting policy.
b Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plans With effect from 1 January 2004, BP has adopted Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No.
38 Accounting for Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP Trusts.
This abstract requires that BP shares held by the group for the purposes of Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs are deducted from equity on the balance sheet.
Such shares were previously classified as fixed asset investments.
In addition, accruals for awards under the Long Term Performance Plan have also been included in reserves.
Shareholders interest at 1 January 2003 has been increased by $26 million.
The impact of the change in accounting policy on profit for the years ended 31 December 2003 and 2004 is not significant.

tax and royalty arrangements and production-sharing agreements When a discovery is made, volumes transfer from the prospect PSAs.
In a concession, the consortium of which we are a part is inventory to the non-proved reserve category.
The reserves move entitled to the reserves that can be produced over the licence period, through various non-proved reserves sub-categories as their technical which may be the life of the field.
In a PSA, we are entitled to recover and commercial maturity increases through appraisal activity.
volumes that equate to costs incurred to develop and produce the Reserves in a field will only be categorized as proved when all the reserves and an agreed share of the remaining volumes or the criteria for attribution of proved status have been met, including economic equivalent.
As part of our entitlement is driven by the an internally imposed requirement for project sanction, or for monetary amount of costs to be recovered, price fluctuations will sanction expected within six months, or as part of a rolling drilling have an impact on both production volumes and reserves.
Twenty-one programme included within our business planning process.
Internal per cent of our proved reserves are associated with PSAs.
The main approval and final investment decision are what we refer to as countries in which we operate under PSA arrangements are Algeria, project sanction.
Angola, Azerbaijan, Egypt, Indonesia and Vietnam.
At the point of sanction, all booked reserves will be categorized As a UK-registered company reporting under UK GAAP, BP as proved undeveloped PUD.
Volumes will subsequently be estimates its proved reserves under UK accounting rules for oil and recategorized from PUD to proved developed PD as a consequence gas companies contained in the Statement of Recommended Practice, of development activity.
The first PD bookings will occur at the Accounting for Oil and Gas Exploration, Development, Production and point of first oil or gas production.
Major development projects Decommissioning Activities UK SORP.
In estimating its reserves typically take one to four years from the time of initial booking under UK SORP, BP uses long-term planning prices: these are the longto the start of production.
Adjustments may be made to booked term price assumptions on which the group makes decisions to invest reserves owing to production, reservoir performance, commercial in the development of a field.
Using planning prices for estimating factors, acquisition and divestment activity and additional reservoir proved reserves removes the impact of the volatility inherent in development activity.
using year-end spot prices on our reserve base and on cash flow BP has an internal process to control the quality of reserve bookings expectations over the long term.
The groups planning prices for that forms part of a holistic and integrated system of internal control.
estimating reserves through the end of 2004 were $20 per barrel BPs process to manage reserve bookings has been centrally controlled for oil and $3.50 per mmBtu for natural gas.
for over 15 years and it currently has several key elements.
In determining reasonable certainty for UK SORP purposes, The first element is the accountabilities of certain officers of the BP applies a number of additional internally imposed assessment company, which ensure that there is clear responsibility for review and, principles, such as the requirement for internal approval and final where appropriate, endorsement of changes to reserves bookings: investment decision which we refer to as project sanction, or for that the review is independent of the operating business unit for the such project sanction within six months and, for additional reserves in integrity and accuracy of the reserve estimates: and that there are existing fields, the requirement that the reserves be included in the effective controls in the reserve approval process and verification that business plan and scheduled for development within three years.
the groups reserve estimates and the related financial impacts are On the basis of UK SORP, our total proved reserves for subsidiaries reported in a timely manner.
and equity-accounted entities at the end of 2004 increased to The second element is the capital allocation processes whereby 18,583 mmboe, representing a proved reserve replacement ratio delegated authority is exercised to commit to capital projects that are RRR before acquisitions and divestments of 110%, versus 109% in consistent with the delivery of the groups business plan.
Our principal equity-accounted entity is TNK-BP.
For subsidiaries review process exists to review that both technical and commercial only, the RRR is 106% and, for equity-accounted entities only, the criteria are met prior to the commitment of capital to projects.
The proved reserve replacement ratio also known as The third element is internal audit, whose role includes the production replacement ratio is the extent to which production systematically examining the effectiveness of the groups financial is replaced by proved reserve additions.
This ratio is expressed in oil controls designed to assure the reliability of reporting and safeguarding equivalent terms and includes changes resulting from revisions to of assets and examining the groups compliance with laws, regulations previous estimates, improved recovery, extensions, discoveries and and internal standards.
other additions, excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestments.
The fourth element is a quarterly due diligence review, which is Natural gas is converted to oil equivalent at 5.8 billion cubic feet equals separate and independent from the operating business units, of 1 million barrels.
By their nature, there is always some risk involved in reserves associated with properties where technical, operational the ultimate development and production of reserves, including but or commercial issues have arisen.
not limited to final regulatory approval, the installation of new or The fifth element is the established criteria whereby reserves additional infrastructure as well as changes in oil and gas prices above certain thresholds require central authorization.
Furthermore, and the continued availability of additional development capital.
the volumes booked under these authorization levels are reviewed The estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves on this basis on a periodic basis.
The frequency of review is determined according are shown on pages 89-90. to field size and ensures that more than 70% of the BP reserves base The US Securities and Exchange Commission SEC rules for undergoes central review every two years and more than 80% is estimating reserves are different in certain respects from SORP: reviewed every four years.
in particular, the SEC requires the use of year-end prices.
87 Supplementary information on oil and natural gas quantities At 31 December 2004, the marker price for Brent crude was $40.24 our reserves under UK SORP.
Excluding equity-accounted entities, per barrel and for Henry Hub gas it was $6.01 per thousand cubic our proved reserves on an SEC basis were 14,625 mmboe.
The total net movement in subsidiaries and equity-accounted entities Applying higher year-end prices to reserve estimates and assuming comprises a decrease of 452 mmboe as a result of using the year-end they apply to the end-of-field life has the effect of increasing proved price, offset by a net increase of 166 mmboe in respect of fuel gas and reserves associated with concessions tax and royalty arrangements technology interpretations.
for which additional development opportunities become economic at On an SEC basis, our total proved reserves for subsidiaries and higher prices or where higher prices make it more economic to extend equity-accounted entities at the end of 2004 decreased by 64 mmboe the life of a field.
On the other hand, applying higher year-end prices to from 18,361 to 18,297 mmboe, representing a proved reserve reserves in fields subject to PSAs has the effect of decreasing proved replacement ratio RRR before acquisitions and divestments of 89% reserves from those fields because higher prices result in lower versus 111% in 2003.
For subsidiaries only, the RRR is 78% and, for volume entitlements.
equity-accounted entities only, the RRR is 114%.
The companys proved reserves estimates on an SEC basis for the We have included certain reserve replacement ratios that are year ended 31 December 2004 reflect year-end prices and some calculated using proved reserves attributed to equity-accounted entities adjustments that have been made vis--vis individual asset reserve as well as consolidated entities and which exclude acquisitions and estimates based on different applications of certain SEC interpretations divestments.
SEC staff guidance states that such measures should of SEC regulations relating to the use of technology mainly seismic not include both proved reserve additions attributable to consolidated to estimate reserves in the reservoir away from wellbores and the entities and equity-accounted entities and should be based on reporting of fuel gas i. e. gas used for fuel in operations on the lease beginning and ending proved reserve quantities as disclosed in the within proved reserves.
On an aggregate basis, the net impact of Annual Report on Form 20-F. On this basis our RRR would be 64% these changes, comprising some reductions and some additions, 39% for 2003. is a decrease of 286 mmboe, resulting in total proved reserves of The estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves prepared on an 18,297 mmboe including equity-accounted entities compared with SEC basis are shown on pages 91-92.
