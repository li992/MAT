As set out in more detail in Note 5, the Company announced on 20 June 2003 a settlement of the US Department of Justice investigation into the US sales and marketing practices for Zoladex goserelin acetate implant.
Negotiations towards this settlement were sufficiently advanced to recognise an exceptional charge of $350m at 31 December 2002.
An agreement has been reached with the US tax authorities that $170m of the settlement is deductible for tax purposes.
Consequently an exceptional tax credit of $58m has been recorded in 2004.
These items are regarded as exceptional due to their unusual and non-recurring nature.
There were no exceptional items in 2003.
