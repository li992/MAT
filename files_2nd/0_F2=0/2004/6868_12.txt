Defined benefit scheme The Company operates a defined benefit pension scheme, the Greggs plc 1978 Retirement and Death Benefit Scheme.
The scheme funds are administered by trustees and are independent of the Companys finances.
Contributions are paid to the scheme in accordance with the recommendations of an independent actuarial advisor.
The pension cost relating to the scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the attained age method.
Actuarial valuations are carried out triennially and the latest actuarial assessment of this scheme was at 6 April 2002.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries.
It was assumed that the investment return would exceed salary increases by 2.0% per annum.
At the date of the latest actuarial valuation, the market value of the schemes assets was 33,334,400.
The actuarial value of the schemes assets represented 87% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
In view of this situation the Company has already made several lump sum contributions to the scheme and has agreed to increase the funding rate, including employees contributions, to a total of 16.5% of annual pensionable salary.
In addition the Company has undertaken regularly to review the funding position and intends to ensure that the scheme is adequately funded to meet its liabilities.
The total pension cost to the Group of this scheme, including the group life premium, was 3,290,000 for the year 2003: 2,627,000.
Whilst the Group continues to account for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits the following transitional disclosures are required.
The actuarial valuation was updated to 1 January 2005, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
As required by FRS 17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method and both the assets and liabilities include the value of those pensions in payment which are secured with insured annuities.
The major assumptions used in this valuation were: 1 January 27 December 28 December 2005 2003 2002 Inflation 2.9% pa 2.7% pa 2.4% pa Pension increases LPI 2.7% pa 2.6% pa 2.4% pa Salary growth 4.4% pa 4.2% pa 3.9% pa Discount rate 5.4% pa 5.4% pa 5.6% pa The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

It has been agreed with the trustees that employers contributions for the period between 6 April 2003 and 5 April 2008 will be at the level of 9.9% of annual pensionable salary, plus the cost of insuring death in service benefits and the cost of administration expenses.

The scheme is now closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS 17, the cost as a percentage of covered pensionable payroll will tend to increase as the average age of the membership increases.
The Groups net assets, including the disclosed FRS 17 balance sheet item above, would be 149,504,000 at 1 January 2005 126,277,000 at 27 December 2003. b.
