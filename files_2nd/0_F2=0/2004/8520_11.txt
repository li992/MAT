The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout policies both the current year and preceding year with the exception of the adoption of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
Following the merger with Torex PLC Torex on 23 December 2003, the Group has adopted FRS 17 in accounting for the defined benefit schemes of Torex.
As the Group has not had any defined benefit pension arrangements in prior years, the change in accounting policy has not resulted in a prior year adjustment.
Acquisition accounting has been adopted for the merger with Torex and the deficit on acquisition of the Torex defined benefit schemes has been dealt with by way of a fair value adjustment.
The principal accounting policies adopted by the directors are described below: i Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings using acquisition accounting.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of during a financial year are included from, or up to, the effective date of acquisition or disposal.
Inter-company transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.
Where a subsidiary is held exclusively for resale, the financial results of that company are not consolidated.
ii Goodwill Positive goodwill is the excess of the fair value of consideration paid for an acquired entity over the aggregate of the fair values of that entitys identifiable assets and liabilities.
Positive goodwill relating to acquisitions is shown in the balance sheet as an asset.
On completion of each acquisition the directors estimate the useful economic life and it is over this period that the goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis.
For transactions where the primary objective is the acquisition of customer base, and where the customer relationships continue under multi-year contract arrangements, the directors believe it appropriate to ascribe useful economic lives of up to 20 years.
To date all acquisitions have been assessed by directors to have useful economic lives of 20 years.
In addition to systematic amortisation, the book value is written down to recoverable amount when any impairment in value is identified.
Where goodwill is subsequently adjusted following the finalisation of contingent deferred consideration, the revised carrying value of goodwill is amortised on a prospective basis over its remaining useful economic life.
iii Research and development Research and development costs are fully written off in the year in which they are incurred.
iv Turnover The Groups revenues are derived from the sale of software product licences, the attendant installation, maintenance and support service revenues, supplies of third party hardware and software.
All revenue is reported exclusive of value added tax and other sales tax.
Historically, in the absence of a United Kingdom accounting standard on revenue recognition, the Group followed guidance set out under US GAAP, in particular SOP 97-2 and SAB 101.
During the current financial year, the Accounting Standards Board issued Application Note G to FRS 5 which closely mirrors the principles historically followed by the Group.
As a result, there has been no change to the recognition of revenue in the Groups financial statements.
The Groups approach to revenue recognition is that revenue is only recognised when: 1. persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists: 2. the price to the customer is fixed or determinable: 3. any services deliverable under the supply arrangement are clearly separable from the software supply: 4. physical delivery has occurred or services have been rendered: 5. contract milestones have been achieved: and 6. collectibility is reasonably assured and there are no material outstanding conditions or contingencies attaching to the receipt of monies due.
In the event that services deliverable under a supply arrangement are not clearly separable from the software supply, total revenue in relation to the supply arrangement is recognised straight line over the period of the arrangement.
45 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS page forty five Notes to the financial statements v Recognition of profit 01 Accounting Turnover from the sale of software product licences is recognised at the time the software licence is granted in policies accordance with agreed contractual triggers, typically the supply of the software product to the customer.
Revenues cont... from the attendant installation, maintenance and support services are recognised proportionally over the period that the services are provided with due regard for future anticipated costs.
Payments received in advance of services are recorded in the balance sheet as deferred income.
vi Foreign exchange Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates ruling at the dates of transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
Translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
Results of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the average exchange rate for the period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries are translated using the closing year end rate.
Exchange differences arising from the re-translation of the opening net assets of overseas subsidiaries are taken to reserves.
vii Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at invoice cost less any applicable discounts.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of tangible assets over their estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
The annual rates of depreciation, by category of fixed asset, are as follows: freehold property 2% office equipment, fixtures and fittings 12.5% to 20.0% computer equipment 33.3% viii Assets held for resale Acquired assets held for resale are stated at the directors valuation of anticipated net realisable value.
ix Stocks Stocks comprise goods held for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition.
x Share schemes The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes Revised 2000 in respect of the accounting for its employee savings related option schemes which states that the requirements of the Abstract need not be applied to such schemes.
The cost in relation to the deferred bonus scheme is charged in the year of performance.
The related credit entry is made within liabilities reflecting the fact that the deferred shares will be satisfied by a purchase of shares from the market.
xi Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less any write down for impairment.
xii Leased assets Assets held under finance leases are included in the balance sheet and depreciated in accordance with the Groups normal accounting policy for the class of asset concerned.
The present value of future rentals is shown as a liability.
The interest element of rental obligations is charged to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
46 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS page forty six Notes to the financial statements 01 xiii Taxation Accounting Corporation tax is provided on taxable profits at the current rate.
policies Deferred tax is provided on timing differences that have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, where the cont... timing differences result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future.
Timing differences arise because of differences between the treatment of certain items for accounting and taxation purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and law enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Where law or accounting standards require gains and losses to be recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses, the related taxation is also taken directly to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
xiv Pensions As noted above, following the acquisition of Torex, the Group acquired a defined benefit pension scheme and has therefore implemented the requirements of FRS 17 during the year.
The pension scheme assets are measured using market values.
Pension scheme liabilities are measured using the projected unit actuarial method and are discounted at the current rate of return on a high quality corporate bond of equivalent term and currency to the liability.
Any increase in the present value of liabilities within the Groups defined benefit pension schemes expected to arise from employee service in the period is charged to operating profit.
The expected return on the schemes assets and the increase during the period in the present value of the schemes liabilities arising from the passage of time are included in other finance income cost.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Pension scheme surpluses, to the extent that they are considered recoverable, or deficits are recognised in full and presented on the face of the balance sheet net of related deferred tax.
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes.
The pension charge shown in the financial statements for these schemes represents the total contributions payable by the Group for the year.
Multi-employer defined benefit schemes are accounted for as defined contribution schemes when the Group is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the schemes.
02 The principal activity of the Group is the development and supply of software application products and related services to Segmental the healthcare sector.
All turnover and profit is generated from this activity.
Net operating costs are analysed as follows: 03 Continuing operations Operating NoteOngoing Acquisitions Total Total profit loss 2004 2004 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Change in stocks of finished goods - 280 280 - Other external charges 26,195 9,628 35,823 30,780 Staff costs 5 29,884 18,454 48,338 24,496 Exceptional staff costs - 5,864 5,864 - Total staff costs 29,884 24,318 54,202 24,496 Depreciation of tangible fixed assets 12 834 1,160 1,994 592 Goodwill amortisation 11 4,668 6,642 11,310 4,650 Other operating charges 15,499 7,793 23,292 10,027 Exceptional other operating charges - 2,047 2,047 - Total other operating charges 15,499 9,840 25,339 10,027 Total operating costs 77,080 51,868 128,948 70,545 Exceptional costs in 2004 comprise the costs of rationalising and reorganising the Group following the acquisition of Torex.

Torex-Hiscom BV participates in an industry-wide defined benefit pension plan, known as the PGGM.
The PGGM provides pension benefits related to final pay at retirement for approximately 1.8 million people, who are current or former employees in the healthcare and social work sector in the Netherlands.
The PGGM is a multi-employer plan under which Torex-Hiscom BV is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities, and the Group has therefore adopted defined contribution accounting as permitted by FRS 17.
The premiums due from the employer for the period 1 January 2004 to 30 April 2004 were 451,000 euros approximately 300,000.
The employers contributions are expected to increase by up to 15% in the foreseeable future to restore the funding level of the PGGM in respect of past service benefits to its target level.
97,532,617 shares at a value of 367,824,750 were allotted on the merger with Torex see note 14i.
