The Group holds various financial instruments in order to manage interest rate risk.
Details of those financial instruments held at the year end are given in Note 17 viii.

Taxation 2003 2004 Restated m m i Analysis of tax charge in year Current tax: UK corporation tax 5.3 37.7 Double taxation relief 5.3 4.9 32.8 Withholding tax 9.5 8.5 Other foreign tax 17.4 49.4 Adjustments in respect of prior periods 2.8 11.5 Joint venture HMV Group plc - discontinued 0.3 Total current tax 24.1 78.9 Deferred tax: Origination and reversal of timing differences 4.5 4.2 Others: Associated undertakings 0.1 0.1 Tax on profit on ordinary activities 19.7 83.2 ii Factors affecting current tax charge for year Loss profit on ordinary activities before tax 52.8 323.8 Tax at weighted average rate 20.4 118.1 Effects of: Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 60.3 4.1 Timing differences 2.5 3.9 Utilisation of tax losses and other credits 59.2 49.8 Origination of tax losses 39.2 6.8 Withholding tax and other 6.7 3.6 Total current tax 24.1 78.9 The weighted average tax rate is calculated by applying statutory tax rates to actual taxable profits and losses in the countries of operation.
The prior-year UK corporation tax charge included the attributable taxation charge relating to non-operating exceptional items falling within the UK tax jurisdiction.
iii Factors that may affect future tax charges No provision has been made for deferred tax where potentially taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets, except where there is a commitment to dispose of these assets.
Such gains would only become taxable if the assets were sold without it being possible to claim roll-over relief or offset existing capital losses.
The Group does not expect any such tax to become payable in the foreseeable future.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of tax on gains arising from the revaluation of fixed assets, as the Group is not committed to the disposal of these assets.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of the earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no dividends have been accrued.
Deferred tax assets which have not been recognised are tax losses and credits with a value of 107.0m, depreciation in advance of capital allowances with a value of 4.2m, and other timing differences with a value of 38.4m, as there is insufficient certainty as to the availability of future taxable profits.

The Preference Share will, in turn, be immediately exchangeable for Ordinary Shares in EMI Group plc.
The number of Ordinary Shares for which a Preference Share may be exchanged will be determined by dividing the paid-up value of the Preference Share, translated into Sterling at a fixed rate of US$1.5957, by the exchange price initially set at 193.38p per Ordinary Share.
Conversion by the holder at 193.38p per Ordinary Share may occur after 11 November 2003 until 7 days prior to the final redemption date.
Conversion by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, of all but not part, may occur if the average price per Ordinary Share on at least 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days has been 130p: or at any time if 85% or more of the aggregate principal amount has been previously purchased, redeemed or cancelled.
Redemption by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, may occur if the same conditions which apply to conversion by the issuer are met.
Final redemption is on 2 October 2010 at 100% of principal and accrued interest.

Floating rate financial assets comprise cash at bank and deposits.
All floating rate financial assets earn interest at rates fixed in advance by reference to the applicable bank reference rate in the relevant country for periods ranging from overnight to six months.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued iii Currency exposures As explained on page 17 in the Financial Review, the Groups objective in managing currency exposures arising from its net investments overseas its structural currency exposures is to maintain appropriate levels of borrowings by currency to hedge partially against currency depreciation.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The table below shows the Groups currency exposures, being those trading assets and liabilities or non-structural exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Profit and Loss Account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating or functional currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain nonSterling borrowings treated as hedges of net investments in overseas operations.
These exposures were as follows: At 31 March 2004 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US Dollar Yen Euro Other Functional currency of Group operation m m m m m Sterling n a 6.6 9.1 8.7 15.1 US Dollar 3.5 n a 0.4 0.4 Yen 0.5 0.2 n a 0.2 Euro 9.5 2.8 0.1 n a 1.4 Other 3.8 0.6 5.3 0.2 Total 8.7 10.2 3.78.5 16.3 At 31 March 2003 Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities Sterling US Dollar Yen Euro Other Functional currency of Group operation m m m m m Sterling n a 3.6 2.3 14.6 6.3 US Dollar 1.6 n a 0.9 0.9 Yen 0.6 0.2 n a 0.2 Euro 6.3 1.1 n a 1.1 Other 3.8 0.4 4.1 0.1 0.4 Total 0.3 4.5 1.8 13.8 7.1 iv Maturity of financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups financial liabilities, other than short-term creditors such as trade creditors and accruals, was as follows: 2004 2003 m m In one year or less, or on demand 35.8 38.5 In more than one year but not more than two years 3.6 193.4 In more than two years but not more than five years 391.0 27.3 In more than five years 676.4 761.6 Total 1,106.8 1,020.8 61 Notes to the financial statements continued 17.

The Group holds equivalent US Dollar and Euro nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon on both the US$ Notes and Euro Notes, effectively converting the interest basis to floating rate set in arrears.
At 31 March 2004, these swaps had a fair value of 2.8m and 9.8m respectively.
Long-term borrowings also include a Sterling Bond issue book value 321.3m with a fair value of 348.3m, US$123.8m 6.96% Senior Notes book value 67.3m with a fair value of 46.6m and a US$243.3m 5.25% Guaranteed Convertible Bond issue book value 126.0m with a fair value of 228.7m.
The majority of other borrowings and liquid funds are short-term in nature and book values approximate to fair values.
For all other financial assets and liabilities, book values approximate to fair values.
vii Management of interest rate risk As explained in the Financial Review, on page 17, the Groups policy is to manage interest rate risk, using interest rate swaps, caps and collars.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for managing interest rate risk, and the movements therein, are as follows: Total net Gains Losses gains losses m m m Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 April 2003 6.7 6.7 Gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in 2004 6.7 6.7 Gains and losses arising before 1 April 2003 that were not recognised in 2004 Gains and losses arising in 2004 that were not recognised in 2004 12.6 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 March 2004 12.6 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 or later Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 12.6 12.6 62 17.
Derivatives and other financial instruments continued viii Financial instruments Interest rate agreements To manage interest rate risk, the Group has entered into certain interest rate, collar and swap agreements which, as at 31March 2004, were as follows: Notional Termination Fixed principal date rate Interest rate swaps: Euroreceive fixed rate and pay floating rate set in arrears 425m October 2013 8.63% US Dollarreceive fixed rate and pay floating rate set in arrears $500m August 2009 8.38% In February 2004, following a routine review of derivative positions, the Group unwound a Yen 17,500m interest rate swap at negligible cost.
Under the swap, the Group paid a fixed rate of 0.29% and received a floating rate.
The swap had an original maturity in April 2004.
In February 2003, following a routine review of derivative positions in the prevailing market conditions, the Group unwound a US$500m interest swap position.
The swap effectively switched the 8.735% fixed coupon on the US$ Guaranteed Notes issued in August 1999 to a floating rate of interest.
The Group received a cash payment of US$86.2m 55.6m on the unwind, representing the present value of the expected cash savings from the swap as determined by the expected differential between US short-term and long-term interest rates, discounted at the prevailing market rate.
At 31 March 2002, this swap position had a fair value of 21.0m.
The cash payment was reported on the interest paid line of the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the year ended 31 March 2003.
The gain from the unwind is being amortised over the remaining life of the Notes, thus locking in the future interest cost benefit to be obtained from the swap.
The swap unwind reduces the Groups overall interest rate risk.
Exchange rate agreements As at 31 March 2004, the Group had no currency swaps or forward foreign currency contracts outstanding.

Group reserves include 10.5 m 2003: 10.3 m in respect of its share of post-acquisition retained losses of joint ventures and associated undertakings.
i Capital redemption reserve The capital redemption reserve represents the reduction in distributable reserves for the amount paid to redeem preference B shares as part of the share capital reorganisation ii Other reserves Other reserves of the Company contain a special reserve which reflects the share premium account reduction of July 1988 and unrealised profit on disposal of investments.
Other reserves include the ESOP reserve.
During the year the Group early adopted UITF38 Accounting for ESOP Trusts and UITF17 Revised Employee Share Schemes.
The impact of UITF38 is to show the shares held by the ESOP in reserves at cost until vesting rather than as a fixed asset investment as in prior years.
The impact of UITF17 Revised is to charge the Profit and Loss Account with the market value of the shares at the date of grant rather than cost.
This has an impact of 4.5m on the prior-year result and an impact of 13.0m on the profit and loss reserve.
The EMI Group General Employee Benefit Trust EBT was established to hedge the future obligations of the Group in respect of shares awarded under the Senior Executive Incentive Plan.
The Trustee of the EBT, EMI Group EBT Guernsey Ltd, purchases the Companys Ordinary Shares in the market with financing provided by the Company, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated share liabilities of the Group.
The EBT has, since December 1998, waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of all its holding of the Companys Ordinary Shares.
The EBTs waivers may be revoked or varied at any time.
EBT Group and Company Shares held Nominal in trust value Cost No.
The market value at 31 March 2004 of the Ordinary Shares held in the EBT, which are listed in the UK, was 11.3m 2003: 4.0m.

Pursuant to a joint venture agreement with Mr Norman Cheng Project Typhoon, the Group has agreed to establish and fund new businesses in the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong and South Korea.
The Group has an option to buy, and Mr Cheng has an option to sell to the Group, his equity interest in the joint venture in 2009 at a price determined by reference to earnings over a three-year period.
Such a price can be limited to not more than US$100m.

Contingent liabilities The Directors are not aware of any significant legal or arbitration proceedings, pending or threatened, against any member of the Group which may result in a liability materially in excess of provisions in the financial statements.
Guarantees and other contingent liabilities total 40.0m 2003: 49.5m.
Such liabilities relating to HMV Group plc total 22.1m 2003: 24.4m and for the former Thorn rental business amount to 9.4m 2003: 10.7m : those in respect of Group companies total 8.5m 2003: 14.4m.
Following the demerger of the Thorn rental business in 1996, Group companies remained contingently liable in respect of guarantees given with regard to certain leases on properties occupied or previously occupied by the Thorn business though, as part of the demerger arrangements, Thorn Limited formerly called Thorn plc agreed to indemnify the Group against such liabilities.
One of the Group companies so liable was sold to HMV Group plc as part of the 1998 sale and the Company agreed to indemnify HMV Group plc against any such liability.
The current or former Thorn properties in respect of which the Group remained contingently liable number approximately 50 and the annual rental payments in respect of such properties total approximately 3.6m.
Following the insolvency of Thorn High Street Properties Limited and certain other companies, claims have arisen against the Group in respect of many of the guaranteed leases.
Such claims have been met by Thorn Limited pursuant to its agreement to indemnify the Group, other than in respect of one property where liability is in dispute but the amount is not material.
As part of the sale in 1998 of the companies and assets comprising HMV and HMV Group plc HMV Group, the Group entered into an indemnity deed with HMV Group relating, among other things, to guarantees given by the Group in respect of property leases of which approximately 80 remain outstanding.
Under the deed, HMV Group agreed to indemnify the Group against any payments made under those property leases and certain other guarantees and indemnities.
The aggregate annual rental payments under guaranteed leases are approximately 22.1m, although they are subject to adjustment both up and down under certain circumstances.
The guaranteed leases have terms which expire in one to 22 years, and many of the leases expire in years beyond 2014.
The indemnity deed remains in force in respect of lease guarantees, and HMV Group has secured those obligations pursuant to a security deed, the Companys rights under which rank second behind banks which provide senior credit facilities to HMV Group.
67 Notes to the financial statements continued 27.
Pension arrangements The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The main scheme, which covers employees in the UK, is the EMI Group Pension Fund the UK Fund.
The UK Fund is of the defined benefit type and is open to all permanent employees over the age of 18 employed by the Company and certain subsidiaries in the UK.
Benefits provided by the UK Fund are based on final pensionable pay.
Pensions payable from the UK Fund are guaranteed to increase by 5% per annum or, if a lower rate, by the increase in the cost of living.
Members contribute to the UK Fund at the rate of 4% of pensionable pay.
With effect from 1 April 2004, the Company will contribute a further 21% of pensionable pay.
Aside from the UK, the Group has significant defined benefit schemes in Germany and Japan.
With the exception of these schemes, the other defined benefit schemes operated on behalf of the Group are not material.
The currently agreed rates of contribution by the Group are nil for all significant defined benefit schemes.
Staff engaged in other countries are covered by local arrangements which, in the case of the Group schemes, are of the defined contribution type.
The assets of the Groups pension schemes are held mainly in separate trustee-administered funds.
Employer contributions of 12.6m 2003: 12.7m were charged to the Profit and Loss Account in the year.
Other post-retirement benefit expenses of 0.2m 2003: 0.1m were also charged to the Profit and Loss Account.
Provision is made in the financial statements for the benefits accruing to members of unfunded pension schemes in accordance with the advice of independent actuaries.
The latest available actuarial valuation of the UK Fund was made by a qualified actuary as at 31 March 2003 using the projected unit method.
At that date and on the prudent funding basis used by the Trustee, the market value of the assets was sufficient to cover 91% of the value of the benefits that have accrued to the members, after allowing for assumed increases in earnings, on the actuarial assumptions used, treating the UK Fund as an ongoing entity.
Employer expense in respect of the UK Fund has been calculated in accordance with SSAP24.
On the basis of actuarial advice and using a realistic basis for SSAP24 purposes which resulted in the market value of assets being sufficient to cover 106% of the value of the benefits, it is calculated that the profit and loss charge for the year ended 31 March 2004 is nil.
For SSAP24 purposes we have used the following assumptions: Growth relative to investment return % per annum Rate of investment return 7.1 Rate of pay increases 4.5 Rate of pension increases 2.5 Rate of price inflation 2.5 These rates included allowance for the effects of the tax credit changes introducted by the Finance No.
The most recent full actuarial valuations of the three significant defined benefit schemes were carried out as follows: UK on 31 March 2003, Germany on 1 April 2003 and Japan on 31 October 2003.
