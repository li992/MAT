C11742 Unlvr AR eng 154-164. qxd 8 3 05 11:22 PM Page 159 Additional information for US investors continued Unilever Group Long leasehold interests in land Under UK GAAP, Unilever treats the cost of acquiring a long leasehold interest in land as a xed asset, and depreciates the cost of that asset over the lease term.
Under US GAAP, the cost of long leasehold interests would be deferred within Other assets and recognised on a straightline basis over the lives of the leases as operating lease rentals.
The balance of such assets were 43 million as at 31 December 2004 2003: 58 million.
In all other respects, there are no differences in accounting for these arrangements between UK and US GAAP.
Equity in earnings related to investments in joint ventures and associated companies Under US GAAP, equity in earnings related to investments in joint ventures and associated companies would be disclosed on a single line within the income statement.
In particular, our share of the interest and taxation arising in respect of joint ventures and associated companies would be reported on this line, rather than as part of the total interest and taxation charge for the Group.
US GAAP equity in earnings related to investments in joint ventures and associated companies were 57 million for the year ended 31 December 2004 2003: 48 million: 2002: 54 million.

In September 2004, the FASB delayed the effective date for the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF 03-01, until certain implementation issues are addressed.
The disclosure requirements in EITF 03-01 remain effective.
