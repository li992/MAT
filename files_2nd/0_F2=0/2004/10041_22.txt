Fixed rate borrowings Weighted average Non interest Weighted period Floating Fixed bearing Total average for which 2003 2003 2003 2003 interest rate rate is fixed 000 000 000 000 % Years US dollars 24,493 131,616 156,109 5.4 5.3 Swiss francs 26,875 26,875 Euro 2,460 2,460 51,368 131,616 2,460 185,444 The weighted average period to maturity for non interest bearing financial liabilities is 3.1 years.
In addition to the above, the Groups provisions of 2,077,000 2003: 2,686,000 for onerous lease costs see note 21 meet the definition of financial liabilities.
These financial liabilities are considered to be floating rate financial liabilities.
This is because in establishing the provisions, the cash flows have been discounted and the discount rate is re-appraised on a regular basis to ensure it reflects the market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
ii Interest Rate and Currency Profile of Financial Assets The interest rate and currency profile of the Groups financial assets after taking account of the financial derivatives was: Non interest Non interest Floating bearing Total Floating bearing Total 2004 2004 2004 2003 2003 2003 000 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 4,927 1,075 6,002 22,769 1,084 23,853 US dollars 31,227 31,227 14,905 15 14,920 Swiss francs 1,542 1,542 1,136 14 1,150 Euro 7,872 7,872 5,621 7 5,628 Other 1,617 1,617 442 - 442 43,951 1,075 45,026 44,873 1,120 45,993 The non interest bearing financial asset relates to the Groups trade investment see note 15.
Other in 2004 represents a Canadian Dollar overdraft balance which has the right of set-off with certain other financial asset balances held by the Group.
Interest payments on the floating rate assets and liabilities are determined by reference to short term benchmark rates applicable in the relevant currency or market, such as LIBOR, the US Prime Rate and the UK Bank Base Rate.

Financial Instruments continued iii Committed Facilities The Group had the following committed facilities: 2004 2003 Drawn Undrawn Total Drawn Undrawn Total 000 000 000 000 000 000 $250m Senior Notes 130,215 130,215 139,657 139,657 Syndicated credit facility 219,140 135,045 354,185 125,691 125,691 Bilateral credit facilities 13,407 28,490 41,897 349,355 135,045 484,400 153,064 154,181 307,245 The committed facilities outstanding at 31 December 2004 and 2003 all expire more than two years from the balance sheet date.
iv Uncommitted Facilities The Group has various uncommitted facilities with its relationship banks.
v Fair Values A comparison of current and book values of all the Groups financial instruments is provided below.
Where market prices are not available for a particular instrument, fair values have been calculated by discounting future cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
2004 2003 Book value Fair value Book value Fair value Assets liabilities 000 000 000 000 Cash at bank and in hand 43,951 43,951 22,670 22,670 Investments 1,075 1,075 1,075 1,075 Borrowings due within one year 5,914 5,914 7,791 7,791 Borrowings due after more than one year 367,879 368,774 155,405 155,405 Other financial liabilities onerous lease costs 2,077 2,077 2,686 2,686 Interest rate derivatives 378 3,080 Foreign exchange derivatives 5,556 3,024 The amounts disclosed above are shown gross of unamortised debt issue costs of 1,637,000.
For cash at bank and in hand, investments and short-term borrowings, the fair value approximates to the carrying value due to the short maturity periods of these financial instruments.
For medium and long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash flows at prevailing market rates.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.
vi Currency Exposure Taking into account the effects of forward contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group did not have a material exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses which would be recognised in the profit and loss account.
vii Market Price Risk and Credit Risk The Group uses derivative instruments only for hedging purposes and generally holds its interest bearing assets and liabilities to maturity and therefore does not consider itself subject to price risk.
The Group is subject to credit risk on the counterparties to its financial instruments, which it controls through dealing only with highly rated counterparties and netting transactions on settlement where possible.
viii Hedges The Groups policy is to use derivative instruments to hedge against exposure to movements in interest rates and exchange rates.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used for hedging are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged exposure is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging purposes are set out below: Total net Gains Losses gains losses 000 000 000 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 1 January 2004 3,171 3,227 56 Less: gains and losses arising in previous years that were recognised in the year 3,171 2,434 737 Gains and losses arising before 1 January 2004 that were not recognised at 31 December 2004 793 793 Gains and losses arising in the year that were not recognised at 31 December 2004 6,027 700 6,727 Unrecognised gains and losses on hedges at 31 December 2004 6,027 93 5,934 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 4,610 45 4,565 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 1,417 48 1,369 Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2004 55 Notes to the Financial Statements 21.

These primarily relate to environmental issues pertaining to businesses sold by Whittaker Corporation prior to its acquisition by the Group.
Appropriate insurance coverage has been taken out by the Group to cover such risks.
Provision has been made for the gross estimated liability and an asset of 22,989,000 2003: 19,454,000 has been recognised as a debtor for the amounts recoverable from the insurers see note 17.
At acquisition, Whittaker was also subject to certain litigation claims, both existing and threatened, relating to businesses it had sold but for which it retained a liability.
A provision exists representing the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs.
The provisions are expected to be mainly utilised over the next 10 years.
b Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of properties with onerous lease obligations and will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to ten years.
c Provision has been made for product warranty claims.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years.
d Provision for deferred tax has been made on the unamortised development expenditure as at 1 January 2004.

Deferred Tax continued Deferred taxation has not been provided on revaluations of fixed assets and it is estimated that no tax would become payable on their disposal, owing to the availability of capital losses or rollover relief.
The Group has unrecognised deferred tax assets of 19 million 2003: 11 million.
The majority of these timing differences relate to the Groups operations in the USA and pre-acquisition losses in the acquired Dunlop businesses.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
Shares under option marked have been purchased in the market from previously issued share capital and are held by the trustee of the ESOP as shown in note 25.
Numbers of shares and prices above have been adjusted to reflect the bonus element of the rights issue approved by shareholders on 21 July 2004.

The shares in the Company own shares are held by an independently managed Employee Share Ownership Plan which was formed to purchase shares to be used to meet certain of the Companys future obligations in respect of employee share schemes as described in the Remuneration Report on page 31.
At 31 December 2004 the trust held 93,747 ordinary shares 2003: 58,135 shares of which 24,030 were allocated to the Meggitt 1996 Executive Share Option Schemes 2003: 42,635 shares and 69,717 were unallocated 2003: 15,500 being retained by the trust for future use.
The market value of the shares at 31 December 2004 was 245,000 2003: 137,000 representing 0.02% of the issued share capital of the Company 2003: 0.02%.
The Group retains the full benefit of these shares until such time as participating employees exercise their options.
The trustee has also purchased shares in respect of share schemes where the Group has had no benefit accruing to it from the dates of purchase.
Amounts owing in relation to these shares are disclosed under other debtors see note 17.
The adoption of UITF38 has resulted in the presentation of shares in the ESOP trust as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds and has led to a decrease in shareholders funds.
The shares were purchased in prior years and have a cost of 39,000 at 31 December 2004 2003: 64,000.
The re-presentation of the ESOP shares as a deduction from the profit and loss account in accordance with UITF38 is not a recognised gain or loss.

This represents a significant long term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of a number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product solution and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 40 years.
The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant contingent liabilities arising from these commitments.

Acquisitions continued Acquisitions Goodwill on acquisitions is based upon a provisional allocation of fair values comprised 322.9 million in respect of Dunlop, and 11.4 million in respect of Wilcoxon, Schreiner and the Eaton product lines.

ii Fixed assets have been adjusted to reflect the depreciation of plant and machinery over up to ten years and valued on a basis consistent with Meggitt Group policy.
iii Adjustments have been made to recognise provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory on a consistent basis with Meggitt Group policy.
iv The accounting policy alignment includes the recognition of contract liabilities in accordance with Meggitt Group policy.
The revaluation refers to the short term element of the pension deficit see v below.
v In accordance with SSAP 24 the deficit existing on the defined benefit pension scheme at completion has been recognised as a liability in the Group accounts.
vi The adjustment relates to the recognition of deferred tax assets or reduction of existing deferred tax liabilities arising from the fair value adjustments noted above.
The unaudited non statutory information presented below for the seven months ended 31 July 2004 is stated using the accounting policies of Dunlop prior to acquisition.
It is compiled from the management accounts of the acquired Dunlop businesses.
The reported results for interest and tax have not been adjusted to exclude amounts included in the management accounts of the acquired Dunlop businesses which arose solely because of the financial structure of the Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group prior to acquisition.

The businesses contributions to the Group net operating cash flow, interest paid, tax paid and capital expenditure were not significant.
Trading results since acquisition are shown on the face of the profit and loss account: no individual acquisition is considered significant.
Amendment to the fair value of acquisitions The 2003 provisional fair value adjustments have been revised in the year, principally due to the finalisation of purchase price adjustments resulting in amounts received from the vendors of the acquired businesses.
The total adjustment to goodwill was a reduction of 0.8 million.
The 2004 provisional fair values will be finalised during 2005.
Contingent Liabilities The parent Company has given guarantees in respect of uncommitted credit facilities for certain of its subsidiaries, some property leases, other leasing arrangements and the performance by some current and former subsidiaries of certain contracts.
Also, there are similar guarantees given by certain of the management companies.
The Company and various of its subsidiaries are, from time to time, parties to legal proceedings and claims which arise in the ordinary course of business.
The directors do not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, actions and claims, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Groups financial position.
Pensions a Group Schemes In the UK, most employees are members of the Meggitt Group 1990 Pension Plan 1990 Plan, the Meggitt Executive Pension Plan MEPP or the Dunlop Aerospace Limited UK Pension Scheme.
On 24 August 2004, Meggitt PLC acquired the Design and Manufacturing Division of the Dunlop Standard Aerospace Group.
The acquired business operates the Dunlop Aerospace Limited UK Pension Scheme.
These are defined benefit plans, the assets of which are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
The latest actuarial valuation of the 1990 Plan was carried out as at 1 July 2004 and the provisional valuation results show that the Plan was 85% funded on estimated final salaries using a 2.5% per annum gap between salaries and yields.
The assets were valued at 116 million.
The latest actuarial valuation of the MEPP was carried out as at 6 April 2004 and the provisional valuation results show that the Plan was 98% funded using a 2.5% per annum gap between salaries and yields.
The assets were valued at 31.1 million.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Dunlop Plan was carried out as at 5 April 2003 and the valuation results showed that the Plan was 82% funded using a 2.0% per annum gap between salaries and yields.
The assets were valued at 53.8 million.
The pension costs relating to the Meggitt Plans are assessed in accordance with the advice of Mercer Human Resource Consulting, consulting actuaries, and for the Dunlop Plan with the advice of  LLP.
They used the projected unit method for both the 1990 Plan and the Dunlop Plan, with the attained age method used for the Executive Plan.
The figures currently used for accounting purposes as regards pension costs are likely to change significantly as and when FRS 17 is adopted.
62 Meggitt PLC Report and Accounts 2004 33.
Pensions continued The pension charge in the UK for the year was 6.6 million 2003: 5.3 million.
In respect of the Meggitt Plans an amount of 3.5 million 2003: 3.7 million is included in other debtors, being the excess of the amount funded over the amount charged to the profit and loss account.
This is being amortised over the average remaining service lifetime of employees.
In respect of the Dunlop Plan an amount of 9.3 million is included as a liability representing the scheme deficit.
In the USA most employees are covered by defined contribution 401k plans.
In 1994, prior to acquisition by the Group, Whittaker Corporation amended its 401k plans and also froze benefits to the Whittaker Corporation Employees Pension Plan Whittaker Frozen Plan, a defined benefit scheme.
This frozen plan is reviewed annually for FASB 87 purposes by Aon Consulting and at 31 December 2004 the assets were valued at $113.2 million 2003: $116.8 million with a projected benefit obligation of $131.7 million 2003: $132.7 million.
In other overseas countries the Group provides pensions in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practice.
In 2004 the actual profit and loss pension charge to the Group for overseas defined contribution pensions was 5.2 million 2003: 4.8 million.
b FRS 17 Retirement Benefits In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board ASB issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits, replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
In November 2002 an amendment to FRS 17 was published which allowed an extension to the transitional arrangements of FRS 17.
The Group continues to adopt the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 and the required disclosures are made below.
The Group will be required to adopt International Accounting Standards, as published by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, for subsequent accounting periods.
Given recent amendments announced to IAS 19 Employee Benefits the Group will take advice to ensure that it continues to adopt best practice in respect of accounting for retirement benefits.
Assumptions, asset, liability and reserves disclosures The valuations used for FRS 17 disclosures have been based on the most recent actuarial valuations at April 2004 for MEPP, July 2004 for the 1990 Plan, December 2003 for the Whittaker Frozen Plan and Whittaker unfunded plans and April 2003 for the Dunlop plan and updated by the actuaries to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the schemes at 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004.
Employer cash contributions to defined benefit plans for the year were: MEPP 1.0 million 2003: 1.1 million, 1990 Plan 4.1 million 2003: 4.2 million, Whittaker Frozen Plan Nil 2003: 2.7 million, Whittaker unfunded plans 0.4 million 2003: 0.5 million and Dunlop Plan 1.7 million from date of acquisition.
