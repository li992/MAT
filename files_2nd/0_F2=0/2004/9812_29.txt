10 EARNINGS PER ORDINARY SHARE Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period, excluding those held in the ESOP see note 22 which are treated as cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the weighted average market price of the Companys shares during the period.
Supplementary earnings per share figures are presented.
These exclude the effects of exceptionals and goodwill amortisation.
The Directors consider that the supplementary figures provide a useful additional indication of performance.
