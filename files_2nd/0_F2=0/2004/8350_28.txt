Notes to the accounts for the year ended 31 December 2004 1.
Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and with the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the year and the previous year except for the adoption of UITF 38 as explained below.
The Group continues to comply with the transitional arrangements under FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
These have had no effect upon the results for the year, as set out in note 7b.
During the period the Group adopted UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts.
The effect of UITF 38 is to reclassify the presentation of the Groups investment in own shares from current assets to be a deduction from shareholders funds.
Comparative figures have been reclassified accordingly.
The particular policies adopted by the directors are described below.
a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
b Basis of consolidation The Group financial statements consolidate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
Investments in joint ventures are accounted for under the gross equity method.
Investments in associated undertakings are accounted for under the equity method.
For joint arrangements that are not an entity the accounts include the Groups share of turnover, profits, net assets and cash flows measured according to the terms of the agreement covering the arrangement.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included from the effective date of acquisition or until the effective date of disposal respectively.
Profits arising on trading between Group undertakings are excluded.
c Goodwill Where, on acquisition of shares in a subsidiary undertaking, the purchase consideration includes a sum over and above the fair value of the net assets acquired, the excess, being the provisional calculation of goodwill, is included in fixed assets and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life, which is normally assessed as being 20 years unless exceptional circumstances arise.
The profit or loss on disposal of a business is calculated after taking into account any applicable goodwill previously written off to reserves.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of shares in associated undertakings is included within investments in associated undertakings.
d Foreign currency Transactions denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the rates ruling at that date.
These translation differences are dealt with in the profit for the year.
The financial results and cash flows of foreign subsidiaries, associated undertakings and joint arrangements that are not an entity are translated into sterling at the average rate of exchange for the year, the balance sheets are translated into sterling at the closing rate of exchange, and the difference arising from the translation of the opening net assets and financial results for the year at closing rate is taken direct to reserves.
e Turnover Turnover, which excludes sales between Group undertakings, comprises the value of goods and services supplied to external customers and the value of work executed in respect of contracts, excluding VAT.
f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation i Depreciation is provided on a straight line or reducing balance basis at rates ranging between: Straight line Reducing balance Freehold land nil Freehold buildings 2% to 5% Leasehold propertyover the period of the lease Plant and equipment 10% to 50% 11.5% to 38% ii Fixed assets leased under finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The finance charges are allocated over the primary period of the lease in proportion to the capital element outstanding.

Accounting policies continued f Tangible fixed assets and depreciation continued iii The costs of operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account as they accrue.
g Investments Investments are stated at cost less provision for any impairment in value.
h Stocks and work in progress i Stocks and property work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
ii Contract work in progress is valued at cost plus attributable profit less foreseeable losses.
Attributable profit is included when the outcome of a contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty.
The value of contract work in progress is accounted for within turnover, and in accordance with SSAP 9 Stocks and Long-term Contracts, the excess of the book value over payments receivable is included in debtors as Amounts recoverable on contracts.
Payments receivable in excess of book value on an individual contract basis are included in creditors.
iii Project-specific finance costs are capitalised until the asset becomes operational.
i Pre-contract costs In compliance with UITF 34 pre-contract costs are recognised as expenses as incurred, except that directly attributable costs are recognised as an asset when it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained and the contract is expected to result in future net cash flows.
j PFI projects In accordance with FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions Application note F the Group has determined the appropriate treatment of the principal assets of, and income streams from, PFI and similar contracts.
Where the balance of risks and rewards derived from the underlying assets are not borne by the Group, the asset provided is accounted for as a financial asset.
Revenues received from the customer are apportioned between capital repayments, finance income and operating revenue.
The finance income element is shown within interest receivable.
k Pensions The Group operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme which is of the defined benefit type and the Interserve Retirement Plan which is of the defined contribution type.
The Group also set up a new defined contribution section of the Interserve Pension Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002.
Actuarial valuations are carried out every three years.
The deficit surplus in the Groups pension scheme after offsetting regular pension costs and allowing for accruing interest will, in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, be released to the profit and loss account over the average remaining service life of employees.
The amortisation of the experience deficit surplus less pension cost charged to the profit and loss account is reflected in the balance sheet.
For defined contribution schemes, the amount recognised in the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes during the year.
l Taxation Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences which result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to apply when they crystallise based on current tax rates and law.
Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is not provided on timing differences arising from the revaluation of fixed assets where there is no commitment to sell the asset, or on unremitted earnings of subsidiaries and associates where there is no commitment to remit these earnings.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Interserve Plc Annual Report 2004 49 Notes to the accounts continued 1.
Accounting policies continued m Financial instruments Transactions in derivative financial instruments are for risk-management purposes only.
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate and foreign currency risk.
To the extent that such instruments are matched to underlying assets or liabilities, they are accounted for using hedge accounting.
Transactions covered by foreign exchange contracts are recorded at the contracted rate.
Interest rate payments and receipts under interest rate derivative contracts are spread and added to netted against the corresponding interest charge or interest receivable in the profit and loss account over the life of the instruments.
For foreign exchange instruments, premiums or discounts are spread over the life of the underlying transactions being hedged.
Where the underlying position being hedged is permanently reduced, the profit or loss on the closure of the corresponding hedge position will be taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which the position is closed out.

Directors remuneration Detailed disclosures of directors individual remuneration and share options are given in the Directors remuneration report on pages 33 to 41 and should be regarded as an integral part of this note.
Pension scheme - SSAP 24 disclosures a The Group operates two principal pension schemes for the benefit of permanent members of staff: the Interserve Pension Scheme the Scheme which is of the defined benefit type and the Interserve Retirement Plan which is of the defined contribution type.
The Group also set up a new defined contribution section of the Scheme with effect from 1 November 2002.
From November 2002 the defined benefit section of the Scheme was closed to all but a very few new entrants and those employees who, under agreement, TUPE transfer to the Group from the public sector.
Taking account of these factors, it is expected under normal circumstances that the age profile of the active membership of the defined benefit section will rise and consequently under the projected unit method the current service cost will increase as the members of the Scheme approach retirement.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group and are managed by external independent investment managers appointed by the Trustees.
b The net pension costs for the year note 5 are made up as follows: 2004 2003 million million UK defined benefit scheme: Regular cost 1.6 3.7 Amortisation of experience deficit and interest 4.0 4.4 SSAP 24 cost 5.6 8.1 National Insurance costs 1.2 0.8 6.8 8.9 Other UK schemes 2.7 2.8 Overseas and other pension contributions 0.7 0.6 10.2 12.3 National Insurance costs arise on the change in the contracted-out nature of the Scheme to a money purchase basis, with effect from 6 April 2003. c The pension cost relating to the Interserve Pension Scheme is assessed in accordance with the advice of a qualified actuary using the projected unit method.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the actuarial calculations are those relating to the return on investments and the rate of increase in salaries and pensions.
It is assumed that the investment return will exceed salary increases by 4.7 per cent per annum, and increases to present and future pensions in payment by 6.2 per cent per annum.
d The actuarially assessed experience deficit surplus in the Scheme is being amortised on a straight line basis over the average remaining service lives of employees.
e The pension scheme prepayment of 37.7 million 2003: 33.2 million shown in the balance sheet represents the amortisation of the experience surplus less pension cost credited to profit and loss account.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Interserve Pension Scheme was at 31 December 2002.
At the date of that actuarial valuation the market value of the Schemes assets was 212.5 million and represented approximately 83 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
Since the date of the valuation, on the recommendation of the actuary, the Group has recommenced contributions to the Scheme.

Pension scheme - FRS 17 disclosures The principal pension schemes within the Group have been valued for the purposes of the transitional arrangements under FRS 17.
For each of these pension schemes valuation information has been updated by Lane Clark & Peacock LLP, qualified independent actuaries, to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 December 2004.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 December 2004.

Interserve Plc Annual Report 2004 67 Notes to the accounts continued 22.
Financial instruments continued e Market price risk The Group seeks to control its exposures to changes in interest rates by limiting their impact on the interest charge in the profit and loss account.
This is achieved through the use of interest rate caps where appropriate.
An instantaneous 1 per cent increase across all relevant interest rates would increase the Groups interest charge by less than 0.5 per cent of consolidated Group profits before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
In addition the Group seeks to selectively hedge its foreign currency dividends either through forward contracts or by purchasing options.
At 31 December 2004 none of the Groups expected dividends for the year ended 31 December 2004 has been hedged.
A 10 per cent increase in the value of sterling against all relevant currencies would reduce dividend income by less than 0.5 per cent of consolidated Group profits before exceptional items and goodwill amortisation.
f Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to eliminate the currency exposure that arises on sales or purchases denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales or purchases are contracted.
It also uses interest rate caps to manage the interest rate profile.
Changes in the fair value of instruments used as hedges are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged positions mature.
There were no unrecognised gains or losses on hedges at 1 January 2004.
There were no gains or losses on hedges that were recognised in 2004.
