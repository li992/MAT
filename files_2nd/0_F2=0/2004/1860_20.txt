Cash at bank and short-term deposits earn interest determined with reference to the relevant money market deposit rates.
Vendor notes relate to disposals made in previous years and earn interest determined with reference to the relevant LIBOR.
Currency exposures The extent to which the Groups operating entities hold monetary assets and liabilities in currencies other than in their local currency has been reviewed.
Taking into account the impact of forward currency contracts and other derivative instruments, the Group had no material profit and loss exposure to foreign exchange gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies as at 31 December 2004.
Gains and losses on hedges The Group enters into forward currency contracts to eliminate the currency exposures that arise on sales denominated in foreign currencies immediately those sales are transacted.
It also uses interest rate swaps and currency swaps to manage its interest rate profile and translation exposures.
Gains and losses on hedges are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.

All the other fair values shown above have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates.
The interest rates on currency swaps are based upon short-term floating rates and therefore the difference between the book value and fair value is immaterial.

BBA GROUP ANNUAL REPORT 2004 82 23 PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS The Group operates a number of plans worldwide.
The main plans, which cover the majority of employees, are of the funded defined benefit type.
The normal pension cost for the Group, including early retirement costs, was 12.2m 2003: 11.6m of which 8.8m 2003: 7.5m was in respect of foreign schemes.
This includes 5.8m 2003: 5.9m relating to defined contribution schemes.
The pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries, where practicable, using a variety of methods and assumptions and otherwise, in respect of certain foreign schemes, in accordance with local regulations.
The Groups main UK pension commitments are contained within a defined benefit scheme with assets held in a separate trustee administered fund.
Contributions to the scheme are made and the pension cost is assessed using the projected unit method.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was as at 31 March 2004.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the liabilities were an average investment return of 6.7% per annum before retirement and 4.9% after retirement, pay inflation of 4.4% after promotional increases per annum and pension increases of 2.8% per annum.
The market value of the assets of the scheme at the date of the actuarial valuation was 370.5m.
The actuarial value of the scheme assets represented 91% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings, but excluding the costs of early retirement which are dealt with on a pay as you go basis.
The excess of liabilities over assets will be spread over the average remaining service lives of employees to ensure that the scheme liabilities are met as they fall due.
The Group's foreign pension schemes mainly relate to a number of funded defined benefit pension arrangements in North America.
Pension costs have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries, using the projected unit method and assumptions appropriate to the arrangements in place.
The principal assumptions used for the main schemes in North America were that the discount rate used to determine the pension liabilities was 6.0% per annum, and that future salary increases will be 3.75% per annum.
The total market value of the assets of the North American defined benefit pension schemes as at 31 December 2004 was 52.3m 2003: 50.1m.
The aggregate value of the schemes' assets represented 64% of the liabilities for benefits that had accrued to members 2003: 63%.
Included in the balance sheet note 18 is a provision of 6.7m 2003: 7.9m in relation to overseas pension schemes.
The Group also operates a plan in North America which principally covers healthcare and life assurance benefits for its retirees.
The costs of these other post-retirement benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries and accounted for on an accruals basis.
The main assumptions used to determine these costs were a discount rate of 6.0% per annum, and an allowance for the inflation in healthcare costs of 2.7% per annum.
In accordance with FRS 17, and subject to materiality, the latest actuarial valuations of the group's defined benefit pension schemes and healthcare plan have been reviewed and updated as at 31 December 2004.
The following weighted average financial assumptions have been adopted: United Kingdom North America Rest of World p. a.
