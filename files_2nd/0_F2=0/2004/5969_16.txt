Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2004 1 Basis of preparation Accounting policies The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies set out on pages 20 and 21.
Financial position and market conditions The group has experienced increases in demand from both existing and new customers in the groups Wireless Infrastructure business, including greater than expected demand for the power amplier products, as further referred to in the Chairmans Statement.
Global markets, particularly the technology and telecoms sector, continue to experience a high degree of volatility.
It remains difficult to predict total volumes and timing with certainty.
Securing lower costs of production, through greater output from the groups Chinese facility and other cost reduction programmes, remain critical.
The groups increasing exposure to currency movements represents further uncertainty.
The increased demand has resulted in the requirement for additional capital expenditure and working capital investment, which was previously unplanned, but has now been included in the groups working capital forecasts.
The early stages of this investment, together with the poorer than expected operating results in the second half of the year ended 31 May 2004, arising from increased costs related to establishing manufacturing in China and the effects of currency translation, resulted in the group breaching certain financial covenants relating to its term loan.
The groups lending banks have confirmed their continuing support, including the waiving of the covenant breaches referred to above, whilst reserving their rights.
Future covenant tests will be set to a suitable level based on prevailing trading conditions.
The groups overdraft facility has been renewed at 9,000,000 until July 2005.
The Board has built all of these circumstances into their working capital forecasts and has modelled various business scenarios.
Whilst recognising the uncertainties referred to above, the Board has concluded, based on these scenarios, that the groups funding remains adequate and therefore that it is appropriate for the financial statements to be prepared on a going concern basis.

The Board has decided to reorganise the business into four segments.
This is to ensure that the company is best positioned to address the challenges of moving from the development stage into production with a broad range of new products.
The 2003 comparative gures have been re-analysed to be consistent with the current year.

The overseas tax charge for the year arises primarily from the groups operations in China and Finland, where taxable profits cannot be relieved by losses available in other jurisdictions.
The current tax charged for the period is higher than the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom.
The difference is analysed below: 2004 2003 000 000 Loss profit on ordinary activities before taxation 409 3,837 1 1 Loss profit on ordinary activities multiplied by standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 30% 2003 30% 123 1,151 Effect of: Disallowable items 252 196 Disallowable goodwill amortisation 580 624 Depreciation in advance of capital allowances 2,782 1,880 Tax allowance on impaired goodwill 470 526 Other timing differences 500 303 Tax losses carried forward 7,311 2,196 Tax losses brought forward 1,513 102 Start-up years profit exemption and rate reduction in China 1,339 1,357 Overseas tax rate differences 2,636 247 Foreign exchange differences 1,633 1,656 1 1 Current tax 2,711 2,462 5 5 The group tax charge is expected to be primarily the tax charge on profits arising in China and Finland.

32 Filtronic plc Annual Report 2004 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2004 20 Tangible fixed assets continued In carrying out an impairment review under Financial Reporting Standard 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, the Board has reviewed value in use calculations for the compound semiconductor activities at Newton Aycliffe and in California.
In these calculations a discount rate of 10% has been applied to the projected cash ows.
The period over which discounted cash ows were calculated was 6 years.
No cash ows were assumed from that point forward.
This is deemed appropriate as the sales revenue projections were based upon both internally generated forecasts and independent data extending through that period.

The fee revenue is being recognised in the profit and loss account in equal monthly amounts from 1 May 2003 until 31 December 2015.
The fee has been paid by BAE in consideration of Filtronic entering into the agreement to enable BAE to utilise the Newton Aycliffe facility by inter alia maintaining the availability of the Newton Aycliffe facility for the supply of gallium arsenide GaAs products for defence applications and performing the other obligations of Filtronic under the agreement.
The agreement provides for its continuance until 31 December 2015 but may be extended at the option of BAE until 31 December 2025.
In the event that BAE is unable, other than for reasons within the control of BAE, to utilise the Newton Aycliffe facility as described above, the agreement provides that Filtronic will repay the fee.
If such an event occurs, the fee becomes repayable pro rata on a declining linear scale between 1 May 2003 and 1 May 2008.
The agreement makes no provision for the repayment of the fee beyond that date.
The agreement contains a number of obligations on both parties including obligations upon Filtronic to accept and perform purchase orders from BAE in accordance with a schedule of agreed commercial terms, to supply GaAs products to BAE, to maintain the availability of the Newton Aycliffe facility for the continuance of the agreement, to develop and qualify certain processes between March 2003 and July 2004 and to make such processes available to BAE for the design and supply of certain GaAs products for defence applications.
All of the product supply obligations within the agreement will be fullled on normal commercial terms.

Filtronic plc Annual Report 2004 41 Notes to the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 May 2004 36 Pension schemes For United Kingdom employees, the company operates a funded pension scheme providing benets based on final pensionable pay.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee fund administered by independent professional investment managers.
Contributions to the scheme are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the company.
The contributions are determined by a qualied actuary on the basis of annual valuations using the projected unit method and are met in the ratio of two thirds by the company and one third by the employee.
The most recent valuation was at 1 July 2003.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
It was assumed that the investment returns would be 2% per annum in excess of future salary increases and 4.5% per annum in excess of future pension increases.
The pension cost allowed for a deficit variation to be amortised over the working lifetimes of the active members.
The amortisation was calculated to be 242,000.
The most recent actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 14,400,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets represented 80% of the benets that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
In accordance with the actuarys recommendations, contributions to the scheme will remain at 15% of pensionable salaries, two thirds of which is payable by the company.
For employees in Finland, Filtronic LK Oy contributes to a dened contribution pension plan in accordance with Finnish regulations and practices.
The pension cost for the year, based on insurance companies charges, was 1,255,000 2003 1,402,000.
For employees in the United States of America, contributions are made to a dened contribution plan under section 401 k of the Internal Revenue Code.
For employees in Australia, Filtronic Pty Limited contributes to a dened contribution superannuation fund operated by an independent insurance company.
37 Financial Reporting Standard 17 The company has accounted for pension costs in accordance with Statement of Standard Accounting Practice 24 SSAP24.
Financial Reporting Standard 17 FRS17 requires certain transitional disclosures, which are set out below.
The calculations have been based on the findings of the actuarial valuation carried out with effect from 1 July 2003.
The results of that valuation have been projected to 31 May 2004 and then recalculated based on the following assumptions, which the directors consider to be appropriate.

FRS17 disclosures measure the value of these assets at a single point in time, namely 31 May each year.
The pension schemes liabilities are measured by reference to long-term AA corporate bond yields that can also move signicantly and according to market conditions.
FRS17 indicates a deficit in relation to the pension scheme at 31 May 2004.
The Minimum Funding Requirement valuation at 1 July 2003 indicated a surplus with a funding level of 114%.
