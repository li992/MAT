These contracts terminate between 2005 and 2006.
The profit and loss charge includes 10 million of notional interest 2003: 14 million.
In previous years, the group renegotiated certain long-term take-or-pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay for gas that would be excess to requirements and or at prices above likely market rates.
The provision represents the net present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the renegotiations, which are due for settlement in 2008 based on the reserves in a group of third-party fields.
As detailed in note 5, published estimates of these reserves during the year have indicated a reduction from the originally forecast level of reserves.
The provision has been reduced by 51 million based on a conservative view of the revised reserve levels.
