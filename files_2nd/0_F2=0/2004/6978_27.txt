More information on special business Resolution 11: Directors powers to allot share capital This resolution will allow the directors to allot up to 43,096,140 shares, subject to the statutory pre-emption rights in favour of existing shareholders, before the next Annual General Meeting.
The basis of the limitation placed on the directors authority to allot share capital under Section 80 of the Companies Act 1985 is that it should be restricted to the lower of one third of the issued Ordinary share capital of the Company increased by share options granted but not exercised and the authorised but unissued share capital.
Resolution 12: Restrictions on the Directors powers to allot share capital This resolution governs the way the shares authorised in Resolution 11 above may be allotted.
Directors may disregard the pre-emption rights which exist in favour of current shareholders in allotting up to 6,545,192 shares but otherwise any allotment of shares authorised to be issued by Resolution 11 must be on a pre-emptive basis.
The basis of the limitation on the disapplication of pre-emption rights is that it should be restricted to a maximum of 5% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 31 March 2004.
Resolution 13: Share buyback Resolution 13 seeks authority to purchase up to 10% of the Companys ordinary issued share capital during the period stated in the Resolution.
If approved, the directors will exercise this authority only when to do so would be in the best interests of the shareholders generally.
For information, as at 26 May 2004, there were options outstanding over 5,978,435 Ordinary shares, representing 4.6% of the companys ordinary issued share capital on that date.
If the Company was to exercise in full the proposed authority to purchase its own shares and the Companys issued share capital remained unchanged, the shares for which there are outstanding options to subscribe would represent approximately 5.1% of the Companys issued share capital as reduced by those purchases.
Resolution 14: Summary of the principal features of the GWR Group plc 2004 SAYE Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme Eligibility All employees and executive directors of the Company, and such of its subsidiaries as are designated participating companies by the directors, who are resident in the UK for tax purposes and who have completed such minimum period of service not exceeding 5 years as the directors may determine, will be eligible to participate in the SAYE Scheme.
Other employees who are not resident in the UK for tax purposes and who satisfy the service criteria may also be invited to join at the directors discretion.
Grant of options Invitations to apply for options may be issued by the Remuneration Committee in a period of 42 days from the date of approval of the SAYE Scheme by the Inland Revenue, and thereafter in a period of 42 days starting on the announcement to the London Stock Exchange of the Companys interim or final results.
In circumstances deemed exceptional by the Committee invitations may be issued outside this normal period.
Options must be granted not later than 30 days or 42 days in the event that applications need to be scaled down following the dealing day by reference to which the market value of an Ordinary share was determined.
An eligible employee who wishes to accept an invitation must enter into a Save As You Earn Contract SAYE Contract with a nominated savings institution to save a regular monthly sum of up to 250 per month for a period of 3, 5 or 7 years.
Payment for the Ordinary shares which are subject to an option may only be made out of the repayment received under the SAYE Contract, which will include a bonus payable at the end of the period.
An option granted will be over Ordinary shares having an aggregate acquisition price no greater than the total repayments, including the bonus, due under the relevant SAYE Contract.
82 GWR Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 Exercise price The price at which participants in the SAYE Scheme may acquire Ordinary shares shall not be less than the greater of the nominal value of any Ordinary share and 80% of its market price.
So long as the Company remains listed on the London Stock Exchange the market price shall be the average of the middle market quotations of an Ordinary share as derived from the Official List for the 3 business days immediately preceding the date of grant.
Share capital limit No option which is to be satisfied on its exercise by the issue of new shares may be granted on any date if the number of shares to which it relates when aggregated with the number of shares issued or remaining issuable by virtue of options or other rights granted or made in the preceding 10 years under the SAYE Scheme and any other employee share scheme adopted by the Company, would exceed 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company at that time.
Exercise, lapse and exchange of options An option will normally be exercisable during the 6 months commencing on the due date for repayment under the relevant SAYE Contract.
Different time limits will apply in certain circumstances.
For example, if the option holder ceases to be an eligible employee by reason of redundancy, retirement, injury or disability, his option may be exercised within 6 months, and if the participant dies the option is exercisable by his personal representatives within 12 months.
Early exercise is allowed in the event of a takeover, amalgamation or winding-up of the Company, and in specified circumstances options may be exchanged.
Options may be satisfied by the issue of new Ordinary shares or the transfer of existing shares, for example from an employee trust.
Variations in the share capital The number of shares comprised in an option and or the exercise price may be adjusted if any capitalisation issue, offer by way of rights or any sub-division, reduction, consolidation or other variation of the Companys share capital occurs.
Such adjustments will require the prior approval of the Inland Revenue.
Rights attaching to shares If shares are to be allotted and issued to a participant pursuant to the exercise of any option, the Company shall apply for such shares to be admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.
Such shares will rank pari passu with all other issued shares of the Company except for any rights determined by reference to a date preceding the date on which the option is exercised.
Amendments The SAYE Scheme may be amended at any time by the directors, provided that, without the prior approval of the Company in general meeting, no amendments may be made to the advantage of participants in respect of the provisions relating to eligibility, share capital limits, maximum entitlements and the basis for determining and adjusting a participants entitlement.
The requirement to obtain prior approval of the Company in general meeting will not apply in relation to any amendment which is of a minor administrative nature or is made to obtain or maintain Inland Revenue approval or to comply with the provisions of any existing or proposed legislation, or to obtain or maintain favourable taxation, exchange control or regulatory treatment.
No amendment may be made to the SAYE Scheme which would adversely affect the subsisting rights of a participant unless the consent of a 75% majority of the participants to the making of much amendment is obtained.
The directors reserve the right up to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to make such amendments and additions to the SAYE Scheme as they consider appropriate, provided they do not conflict in any material respect with this summary of the SAYE Scheme.
Administration and general The savings provider for the SAYE Scheme will be appointed by the directors.
The savings provider will provide support in relation to the administration of the SAYE Scheme.
The Company may terminate the SAYE Scheme at any time.
Subject to such termination, it shall terminate 10 years from the date of its adoption by shareholders.
Benefits received under the SAYE Scheme will not be pensionable.
At the discretion of the directors, the SAYE Scheme may be extended to overseas employees of the Company and its subsidiaries subject to such modifications as the directors shall consider appropriate to take into account local tax, exchange control, securities law and other regulatory requirements.
