41 SAYE and ESOS options are satisfied through the issue of new shares.
In accordance with the Association of British Insurers Guidelines on Executive Remuneration, grants of options are carefully planned so as not to exceed 5% of the issued Ordinary share capital in any rolling 10 year period for the ESOS, and 10% of the issued Ordinary share capital in any rolling 10 year period overall.
The Committee has regard to appropriate annual flow-rates to ensure that these limits are not breached.
The highest market value during 2004 was 339.0p and the lowest was 258.5p.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The executive Directors and selected senior executives are awarded shares in the Company subject to achieving a total shareholder return TSR target.
To ensure that awards do not vest at a time of overall unsatisfactory financial performance, there must also be an increase in normalised EPS of at least 2% per annum above the growth in RPI over a three year period.
The TSR target measures the Companys growth relative to 19 comparator companies.
100% of the shares vest if the Company achieves upper quartile performance, 30% of the shares vest at median performance, and awards vest on a straight line basis for performance in between.
No shares vest if performance is below median.
The TSR ranking for awards that vested for the performance period ended 31 December 2004 and for those awards not yet vested are: Performance TSR ranking at period ending 31 December 2004 Vesting 31 December 2004 6th out of 20 86% final vesting 31 December 2005 13th out of 20 0% provisional 31 December 2006 14th out of 20 0% provisional Accordingly, in 2005 Mike Smith and Ian Dyson will receive 86% of the shares conditionally awarded to them in 2002 as shown in the table on page 42.
TSR is measured by reference to the change in the price of Ordinary shares over the performance period and the gross value of dividends assuming they are immediately reinvested in shares during that period.
In order to reduce the effects of short term volatility in TSR, the averages of the daily closing prices of shares for the previous three months are used.
A TSR criterion was selected by the Committee because of its link with shareholder value, and a secondary criterion of EPS growth was selected to ensure that awards would not vest at a time of overall unsatisfactory financial performance.
The Rank Group Plc 42 Remuneration Report continued The comparator group of the companies against which TSR is measured currently comprises BAA, Boots, fide Vere, Dixons, EMI, GUS, Hilton, InterContinental Hotels, ITV, Kingsher, Luminar Leisure, Mothercare, My Travel, Next, Pearson, Scottish & Newcastle, Stanley Leisure, WH Smith and Whitbread.
This comparator group of companies was selected by the Committee at commencement of the plan in 2000 because of similarities in market sector and or market capitalisation at that time.
The proposed replacement plan will permit the Committee to select comparator companies that are appropriate at the time of each grant.
The maximum award under the plan is one times basic salary.
The proposed replacement plan will permit a maximum award of one and a half times basic salary, although the general level of awards is not expected to increase in normal circumstances.
The increased maximum will enable the Remuneration Committee to grant higher awards in exceptional circumstances, such as on recruitment of a key executive, as an alternative to increasing non performance-related elements of pay.
The accrual rate does not exceed 1 30th for each year of service.
In addition, the Company pays into a funded unapproved retirement benefit scheme FURBS, which is a defined contribution scheme, on behalf of Mike Smith.
The Company also pays a salary supplement in lieu of additional pension contributions to Ian Dyson.
These amounts are disclosed in the Directors remuneration summary on page 44.
Pension entitlements and corresponding transfer values of the executive Directors for the Rank Pension Plan during the year were: Gross Increase in Transfer Transfer Transfer Increase in increase accrued Total value of value of value of Directors transfer in accrued pension net accrued net increase accrued accrued contributions value net pension of inflation pension in accrued pension pension at during of Directors Age at during 2004 during 2004 at 31.12.04 pension at 1.01.04 31.12.04 2004 contributions 31.12.04 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 000 Mike Smith 57 2 2 10 21 122 166 7 37 Ian Dyson 42 4 3 18 21 104 149 7 38 Accrued pension is the amount which would be paid annually on retirement based on service to the end of the year.
Transfer values have been calculated in accordance with paragraph 1.5 of guidance note GN11 issued by the actuarial profession.
The value of net increase in accrued pension represents the incremental value to the executive Director of his service during the year, assuming service is terminated at the year-end.
The increase in transfer value net of Directors contributions includes the effect of fluctuations due to factors beyond the control of the Company and Directors, such as stock market movements.
The transfer values of the accrued pension represents the value of assets the Pension Plan would need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the Plans liability in respect of the executive Directors pension benefits.
They do not represent sums payable.
The Company continues to review the pension arrangements of all UK-based employees, including the executive Directors, in preparation for the changes to the taxation of pensions from April 2006.
It is the Companys intention that any changes made will not increase the overall cost to the Company.
The Rank Group Plc 43 Service contracts and external directorships It is the Companys policy that the Chairman and executive Directors have service contracts with notice periods not exceeding one year.
However, the Company recognises that in the case of any future appointments from outside the Company, a longer initial notice period may be necessary, reducing to one year or less after an initial period.
There are no predetermined compensation provisions for early termination, and any compensation payable will be determined on an individual basis taking into account length of service, the circumstances surrounding termination and an individuals duty to mitigate losses.
Non-executive Directors do not have service contracts but serve the Company under letters of appointment.
These appointments may be terminated without liability for compensation.
The non-executive Directors appointed during 2004 were appointed for an initial period of three years, subject to review annually thereafter.
Date of service Unexpired Notice contract term period Alun Cathcart 10.04.01 12 months 12 months Mike Smith 25.02.99 12 months 12 months Ian Dyson 17.08.99 12 months 12 months The Company recognises that its Directors may be invited to become non-executive Directors of other companies, or become involved in charitable or public service organisations.
These appointments can broaden the knowledge and experience of the Directors to the benefit of the Company.
Providing there is no conflict of interest and the commitment is not excessive, the executive Directors are permitted to accept one external appointment and to retain any fees received.
During the year, Mike Smith served as non-executive Chairman of communisis plc and retained fees of 100,000 and Ian Dyson served as a non-executive Director of Misys plc and retained fees of 37,500.
