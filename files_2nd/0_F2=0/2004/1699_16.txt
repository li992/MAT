Notes to the financial statements 1 Accounting policies The principal accounting policies are summarised below.
They have all been applied consistently throughout the current and preceding year.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985, except as disclosed in note 1 j. b Basis of consolidation The group financial statements comprise a consolidation of the financial statements of the company and all of its subsidiaries at 31 March.
The results of companies acquired or disposed of are consolidated from the effective date of the acquisition or to the effective date of disposal.
The treatment of a company as an associated undertaking has regard to the groups holding of at least 20 per cent of the equity capital, representation on its Board of Directors and participation in policy making, including dividend policy.
The groups share of the profits or losses of these companies is included in the profit and loss account and the investments are included in the balance sheet at the groups share of the net assets of the companies.
An entity is treated as a joint venture if the group jointly controls that entity together with one or more other venturers under a contractual arrangement.
The groups share of turnover and operating profit of joint ventures has been reported on the face of the profit and loss account and the groups share of gross assets and liabilities has been reported on the balance sheet.
Intra-group sales and profit are eliminated fully on consolidation.
c Goodwill On the acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking, fair values are attributed to the net identifiable assets or liabilities acquired.
Goodwill represents the difference between the fair value of the purchase consideration and the fair value of the net assets acquired.
Fair values are assessed in accordance with FRS 7 Fair Values in Acquisition Accounting.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 31 March 1998 was set off directly against reserves and has not been reinstated on implementation of FRS 10 Goodwill and Intangible Assets.
Positive goodwill arising on acquisitions since this date is capitalised in the financial statements as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight line basis over its useful economic life.
On disposal of a subsidiary any goodwill arising on acquisition that was previously written off to reserves, or that has not been amortised through the profit and loss account is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
d Associates and joint ventures The groups share of turnover and profit and loss of associates and joint ventures is included in the consolidated profit and loss account.
The groups share of their net assets is included in the consolidated balance sheet.
These amounts are taken from the latest audited financial statements of the undertakings concerned or from coterminous management accounts if the balance sheet date in those audited financial statements is greater than three months from the balance sheet date of the relevant group financial statements.
To the extent that joint ventures and associates have net liabilities, the aggregate amount is added back to the amount of investments, and transferred to provisions.
e Unincorporated joint ventures The group share of turnover and profit and loss of unincorporated joint ventures is included in arriving at operating profit and its share of individual assets and liabilities is included, where appropriate, in the consolidated balance sheet.
Construction Profits on short-term contracts are included in the financial statements upon substantial completion of those contracts.
Profits on long-term contracts are included in the financial statements when the outcome of a contract can be assessed with reasonable certainty and are determined by reference to an internal valuation of measured work carried out less related costs of production.
Provision is made in full for foreseeable losses.
Property development Profit is included in the financial statements in connection with property developments when a legally binding contract for the sale of the development has been entered into and legal completion has taken place before the year end.
When legally binding contracts exist, profits on the construction and refurbishment elements of the development are determined on the same basis as for construction.
Other profits arising from developments are included in the financial statements only when legal completion of the sale of the development has been effected.
Claims In establishing turnover and profit, credit is taken for claims only when agreed by the client.
Having credited such claims to the profit and loss account, provision is made whenever ultimate payment seems doubtful.
g Turnover Turnover represents the income receivable excluding value added tax in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided and, in respect of contract work in progress, the value of work carried out when it can be estimated reliably.
The group has implemented Application Note G of FRS 5 during the year: the effect is not material to the financial statements.
Turnover of development and private finance initiative properties is recorded when a sale is completed in accordance with the profit recognition criteria in note 1 f above.
Turnover includes sales of directly held work in progress and interests in special purpose subsidiaries and joint ventures if the substance of the transaction is the sale of the underlying property.
Income includes an estimation of the amount of main water and wastewater charges unbilled at the year end.
The accrual is estimated using a defined methodology based upon weighted average water consumption by tariff, which is calculated based upon historical billing information.
The calculation is sensitive to estimated consumption for domestic customers a fall of 1 cubic metre in average annual consumption will reduce turnover by approximately 1.0 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2004 43 Notes to the financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued h Intangible fixed assets, amortisation and impairment Intangible fixed assets comprise goodwill arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, premiums paid to acquire unincorporated businesses and payments to acquire licences to operate plant, mainly in overseas locations.
Goodwill is generally amortised over 20 years being the Directors best estimate of its useful economic life or the life of the contract if less than 20 years.
At the end of each full year after an acquisition and following the occurrence of an impairment trigger in any year, the carrying amount of goodwill is assessed for impairment by comparing it with the higher of net present value of future cash flows and the expected net realisable value.
Should the carrying amount exceed the higher of these two measures, an impairment charge arises in the profit and loss account in the year.
Licences are amortised over the period of the licence agreement, currently 20 years.
Licences are assessed for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, if an appropriate trigger arises.
i Tangible fixed assets, depreciation and impairment Tangible fixed assets comprise: Infrastructure assets being mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, dams, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls comprise a network of systems.
Investment expenditure on assets relating to increases in capacity or enhancements of the network and on maintaining the operating capability of the network in accordance with defined standards of service is treated as an addition and included at cost after deducting grants and contributions.
The depreciation charge for infrastructure assets is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the network which is based on the groups independently certified asset management plan.
Fixed assets are assessed for impairment in accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of Fixed Assets and Goodwill, if an appropriate trigger arises.
Other assets including properties, over-ground plant and equipment are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Cost includes own work capitalised which represents the direct cost of materials, labour and applicable overheads.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Depreciation of other assets is calculated at rates expected to write off cost, less the estimated residual value of the relevant assets on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives, which are principally as follows: Operational structures 3080 years Buildings 3060 years Fixed plant 1240 years Vehicles, mobile plant and computers 310 years Assets in the course of construction are not depreciated until they are commissioned.
Interest costs are not capitalised into the cost of fixed assets.
j Grants and contributions Grants and contributions on capital expenditure, other than those relating to infrastructure assets, are credited to a deferral account within creditors and are released to the profit and loss account evenly over the expected useful life of the relevant asset, in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985.
Grants and contributions to capital expenditure on infrastructure assets are deducted from the costs of these assets.
This policy is not in accordance with the provisions of Schedule 4 of the Companies Act 1985, which requires grants and contributions to be shown as deferred income, but has been adopted in order to show a true and fair view as, in the opinion of the Directors, while a provision is made for depreciation of infrastructure assets, these assets have no determinable finite economic life and hence no basis exists on which to recognise such contributions as deferred income.
The financial effect of this departure is disclosed in note 13.
Revenue grants and contributions are credited to the profit and loss account in the year to which they apply.
k Leased assets Where assets are financed by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the assets are treated as if they had been purchased and the corresponding capital cost is shown as an obligation to the lessor.
Leasing payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and finance costs, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor, and the finance costs being written off to the profit and loss account over the primary period of the lease.
The assets are depreciated over the shorter of their estimated useful economic lives and the lease period.
All other leases are regarded as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are expensed over the term of the lease.
Equipment leased to customers under operating leases is capitalised in accordance with note 1 i above.
Operating lease income is accounted for on a straight line basis with any rental increases recognised during the period to which they relate.
l Investments Investments held as fixed assets are stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
m Stocks and work in progress Stocks are stated at cost less any provision necessary to recognise damage and obsolescence.
Work in progress, with the exception of long-term contract work in progress, is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes labour, materials, transport and attributable overheads.
Net realisable value is the estimated proceeds from the sale of stock less all further costs to be incurred.
44 AWG Plc n Long-term contracts Amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are stated at cost plus attributable profits less provision for any known or anticipated losses and payments on account and are included in debtors.
Payments on account in excess of amounts recoverable on long-term contracts are included in creditors.
o Pension costs Contributions to the groups defined benefit pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the regular cost of pensions over the average service lives of employees, in accordance with the advice of an independent qualified actuary.
Actuarial surpluses and deficits are amortised, where appropriate, over the average remaining service lives of employees.
The cost of defined contribution schemes is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in respect of which the contributions become payable.
The notes to the accounts disclose the effect of the transitional provisions of FRS 17 Retirement Benefits.
p Research and development Research and development expenditure is charged to the profit and loss account in the year in which it is incurred.
q Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related forward currency contract.
Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, including the groups interest in the underlying net assets of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings, are translated into Sterling at the financial year end exchange rates.
Profits and losses of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into Sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Gains or losses arising on the translation of the net assets of overseas Subsidiaries and associates are taken to reserves, together with exchange differences arising on related foreign currency hedge instruments to the extent these offset.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
r Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is provided on timing differences, arising from the different treatment for accounts and taxation purposes of events and transactions recognised in the financial statements of the current and previous years.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the rates at which it is estimated that taxation will arise.
The deferred taxation balances are discounted using the post tax yields to maturity that could be obtained at the balance sheet date on Government bonds with maturity dates similar to those of the deferred taxation assets and liabilities.
For assets with a life in excess of 30 years, the 30-year bond rate has been used as no other quoted rates are available.
Deferred taxation is not provided in respect of timing differences arising from the sale or revaluation of fixed assets unless, by the balance sheet date, a binding commitment to sell the asset has been entered into, and it is unlikely that any gain will be rolled over.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which the deferred tax asset can be recovered in future periods.
Calculation of deferred tax on infrastructure assets: Infrastructure assets have an effectively unlimited life and a notional depreciation charge, the infrastructure renewal charge, is applied to the network note 1 i tangible fixed assets and depreciation.
For the purposes of estimating the deferred tax liability in relation to infrastructure assets, the useful life over which the underlying differences reverse is estimated by deflating the current cost based infrastructure renewals charge to an appropriate deemed historic cost based depreciation charge.
s Financial instruments Derivative instruments are used for hedging purposes in line with the groups risk management policy and no trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
Loans and other borrowings are recorded using the contracted rates implicit in the financial instruments used to hedge the groups exposure to fluctuations in currency rates.
Similarly, interest is charged to the profit and loss account based on the contracted interest rates.
Issue costs are amortised at a constant rate over the life of the underlying instrument.
t Provisions Provisions of a long-term nature are discounted to reflect the time value of money in the estimated period over which the provision will be utilised.
The rate of discount varies according to the nature of the underlying provision and further details are given in note 22.
The unwinding of the discount on those provisions other than deferred tax is included within net interest payable.
u Bid and pre-contract costs Bid and pre-contract costs are written off as an expense until such time as the award of a contract becomes virtually certain.
v Closure and redundancy costs Once irrevocable decisions have been made to close an operation, provisions are made to reflect the extent to which obligations, including redundancy costs, have been incurred that are not expected to be covered by future profits of the operation.
Provisions include only the direct costs of termination and any operating losses up to the date of the termination, after taking account of the aggregate profit, if any, to be recognised from the future profits of the operation.
Redundancy costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which the group both becomes irrevocably committed to incurring the costs and has announced the main features of the programme to affected employees or their representatives.

The post-tax yield to maturity on UK government bonds is used to discount the gross deferred tax liability of the group.
Movements in the discount rates gave rise to a credit of 3.5 million 2003: charge of 15.7 million in the year.
If all UK gilt rates moved by 0.25 per cent, the tax charge would move by between 10.0 million and 15.0 million.
Adjustments in respect of prior years arise from the agreement of open tax computations.
Factors affecting tax credit for the year including exceptional items The tax assessed for the year is lower than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK 30 per cent.
The differences are explained below: 2004 2003 m m Loss on ordinary activities before taxation 79.8 42.4 Tax on loss on ordinary activities at the standard UK rate of tax 30 per cent 23.9 12.7 Adjusted for effects of: Items not deductible for tax purposes 44.7 23.0 Accounting for depreciation not eligible for tax purposes 0.4 0.2 Capital allowances for the year in excess of depreciation 18.7 4.4 Short-term timing differences 0.7 1.4 Adjustments to tax charge in respect of previous periods 2.1 18.2 Losses which cannot be relieved in the year 1.8 3.5 Lower tax rates on overseas earnings 1.3 0.3 Share of joint venture taxation 1.7 1.5 Current tax credit for the year 0.1 11.8 8 Dividends and other payments to shareholders No cash dividends were paid on ordinary shares during the year.
AWG Plc made the following issues of 0.1 pence redeemable shares during the year: a 177,451 million redeemable shares were issued on 16 June 2003 at the rate of 1,000 redeemable shares per ordinary share held, equivalent to 1.00 per share.
The value of shares issued was 177.4 million.
Shareholders are given the opportunity to redeem at par the redeemable shares twice per annum.

The provision is expected to be utilised over the next 25 years and has been discounted at 6.1 per cent which represents the adjusted credit risk of additional coupon payments following the transfer of debt from AWG Group Limited.

Consequently, changes in the medium-term and long-term interest rates used to discount deferred taxation assets and liabilities can affect the amount of deferred taxation charged or credited in the profit and loss account.
The groups deferred tax liability is stated net of Advance Corporation Tax ACT recoverable.
If changes in the tax legislation were introduced which restricted the ability of companies to use ACT, this asset may no longer be recoverable and in this event an additional charge would arise in the profit and loss account of 66.4 million.

27 Pension commitments Pension arrangements for the majority of the groups UK employees are of the funded defined benefit type, principally through the AWG Pension Scheme AWGPS the AWG Infrastructure Management Pension Scheme AWGIMPS formerly Morrison Pension & Life Assurance Plan and the AWG Pensions & Life Assurance Plan AWGPLAP.
The groups actuaries are AON Consulting.
The defined benefit arrangements are closed to new members, who are eligible instead for entry to the groups defined contribution schemes.
A number of defined contribution schemes operate both in the UK and overseas, and contributions to these schemes in the year amounted to 3.4 million 2003: 1.5 million.
The administration and investment of the pension funds are maintained separately from the finances of the group.
The accounting pension costs have been prepared under SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, based on the most recent full actuarial valuations.
Details of the most recent full actuarial valuations of the pension schemes are summarised below.
