Notes to the financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2004 1 Principal accounting policies The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Groups financial statements, except where stated below.
Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the historical cost convention.
Previously the Group included its share in net liabilities in associates, in investments.
In accordance with FRS 9 these have been reclassified as provisions.
The comparatives for 2003 have been reclassified, by increasing investments and provisions by 386,000.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings made up to 31 March 2004.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
An associated undertaking is one in which the Group holds for the long term a participating interest of usually between 20% and 50% and exerts significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the company.
The Groups share of the results, recognised gains and losses and net assets of associates and of joint ventures undertakings over which the Group exercises joint control are included in the consolidated financial statements by applying the equity method of accounting.
In the consolidated balance sheet, goodwill arising on the acquisition of associates and joint ventures after 1 April 1998 less any amortisation or impairment write-down, is included in the carrying amount of the investment.
Before 1 April 1998, goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries and associates was written off immediately against reserves.
On disposal or closure of the previously acquired business the attributable amount of goodwill previously written off to reserves is included in determining the profit or loss on disposal.
In the Companys financial statements, investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and the joint venture are stated at cost less amounts written off for impairment.
Dividends received and receivable are credited to the Companys profit and loss account to the extent that they represent a realised profit for the Company.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
Intangible fixed assets Treatment of goodwill Purchased goodwill representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given and associated costs over the fair value of the separable net assets acquired arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions before 1 April 1998 when Financial Reporting Standard 10 Goodwill and intangible assets was adopted, was written off to reserves in the year of acquisition.
When a subsequent disposal occurs, any related goodwill previously written off to reserves is written back through the profit and loss account as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
Purchased goodwill arising on consolidation in respect of acquisitions since 1 April 1998 is capitalised.
Positive goodwill is amortised by equal annual instalments over its estimated useful life, normally 20 years.
On the subsequent disposal or termination of a business acquired since 1 April 1998, the profit or loss on disposal or termination is calculated after charging crediting the unamortised amount of any related goodwill.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Licences Licences are capitalised at cost, including the directly attributable costs of licence applications that are incurred after the point at which it is virtually certain that the licence will be awarded and amortised over the period of the licence.
All other costs of licence applications are written off as incurred.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at their purchase price net of accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets, less their estimated residual values, on a straight line basis over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are: 58 GWR Group plc Annual report and accounts 2004 1 Principal accounting policies continued Freehold buildings 2% Transmitters 5% Fixtures and technical equipment 10%-33% Motor vehicles 20% Leasehold land and buildings are amortised over 50 years or, if shorter, the period of the lease.
Finance and operating leases Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Assets held under finance leases are included in tangible fixed assets.
The capital element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.
The interest element is charged against profit in proportion to the reducing capital element outstanding.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
A finance lease is a lease that transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee.
Such a transfer is presumed where, at the inception of the lease, the present value of the minimum lease payments included in any initial payment, amounts to substantially all 90% or more of the fair value of the leased asset.
An operating lease is a lease other than a finance lease.
Turnover Turnover represents amounts invoiced in respect of all services and goods provided during the year, excluding value added tax.
Airtime revenue for analogue and digital and TV revenue is recognised on the date of broadcast.
Sponsorship, internet revenue and transmission fees for the digital multiplexes are recognised evenly over the life of the contract or in accordance with specific contract terms if applicable.
Advertising production revenue is recognised on the date of release to the client.
Enterprise revenue relating to events is recognised upon agreed settlement with all related parties and CD revenue is recognised on date of sale.
During the year the Group entered into barter contracts for advertising and other services with its clients for a total value of 1,598,547 2003: 2,570,000.
The total amount of barter transactions for advertising that is included in turnover is 68,711 2003: 237,245.
These are recognised as there is persuasive evidence of the value in accordance with Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract No.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the groups taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Foreign currencies Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the profit and loss account.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary and associated undertakings are translated at the closing exchange rates.
Profit and loss accounts of such undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year.
Gains and losses arising on these translations are taken to reserves, net of exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings.
Pension costs Most of the Groups employees participate in defined contribution pension schemes, where pension costs are calculated as the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.
Differences between contributions payable and contributions paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme in respect of certain other employees.
The funds are valued every three years by a professionally qualified independent actuary.
Pension costs are accounted for on the basis of charging the expected cost of providing pensions over the period during which the relevant company benefits from the employees services.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to reduce exposure to interest rate movements.
The Group does not hold or use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Interest payments arising from financial instruments are recognised within net interest payable over the period of the contract.
Any premiums or discounts arising are amortised over the lives of the instruments.
The group presents operating profit before goodwill and exceptional items as the directors consider it to be an appropriate measure of underlying profitability.
See note 4 for an analysis of goodwill amortisation and exceptional items.
Net assets are stated after allocating company debt.

The calculation is based on the weighted average number of shares in issue for the year of 130,733,737 2003: 127,145,369 and the adjusted profit of 10,458,000 2003: 6,148,000.

The pension scheme provides benefits based on final pensionable pay, contributions being charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The contributions are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the current unit method.
The most recent valuation was at 30 September 2002.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the rate of return on investments pre retirement 9.0%, post retirement 8.0% and the rates of increase in salaries 6.0% and pensions 3.75%.
The most recent actuarial valuation showed that the market value of the schemes assets was 4,467,000 at 30 September 2002 the share of this relating to the Group was 1,732,000 and that the actuarial value of those assets was exceeded by the schemes liabilities by 16% the equivalent ratio for the Group share is 19%.
The rate of contribution made in the current year was 14.9% with currently agreed future rates of contribution to be between 14.9% and 24.2%.
The pension charge for the year includes 74,004 2003 68,000 in respect of the amortisation of experience deficits that are being recognised over 16 years, the average remaining service lives of employees.
