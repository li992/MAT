UITF Abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and the revision of UITF 17 Employee Share Schemes were issued on 15 December 2003 and are applicable for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Under UITF 38, shares held through an ESOP trust are shown as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
Previously these shares were shown as a fixed asset investment.
The reclassification of own shares held from fixed asset investments to equity has reduced net assets by 8.5m at 31 December 2004 2003 5.2m.
Under the revised UITF 17, share based payments made are charged to the profit and loss based on the intrinsic value of the shares rather than the book value.
This amendment has resulted in a reduction in operating profit of 0.8m for the year to 31 December 2004 2003 1.1m.
There has been no change to the net assets at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 as a result of the revisions to UITF 17.
A summary of the principal group accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is given below.
Basis of consolidation The group financial statements consolidate the results of Taylor Nelson Sofres plc and its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2004.
The results of all subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of are accounted for under acquisition accounting rules and are included in the profit and loss account from the effective date of control.
Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated on consolidation.
Joint ventures and associates Joint ventures are those entities in which the group holds a long-term interest and which are jointly controlled by the group and one or more venturers under a contractual agreement.
Joint ventures are accounted for using the gross equity method of accounting for the period of the groups ownership.
Associates are those undertakings, other than subsidiaries and joint ventures, in which the group holds a long-term participating interest and exerts a significant influence.
The groups share of profits losses of associates is included in the group profit and loss account and the groups share of their net assets, together with goodwill arising on acquisition, is included in the group balance sheet for the period of the groups ownership.
Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill arising on consolidation for acquisitions made since 1 January 1998 is amortised in equal annual instalments over its estimated useful economic life of up to 20 years, and charged to the profit and loss account.
Goodwill is subject to an impairment review at the end of the first full year following an acquisition and at any other time, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
If an undertaking is subsequently sold, the appropriate unamortised goodwill or goodwill written off to reserves is dealt with through the profit and loss account in the period of disposal as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are converted at rates of exchange prevailing at the date the transactions were made.
Foreign exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and loss account except for differences arising on the retranslation of loans taken out to finance overseas subsidiaries, which are dealt with through reserves.
Financial statements of overseas operations are translated using the closing rate net investment method, except that profits and losses of overseas operations are translated at the average exchange rate applicable to the period.
Differences arising on translation of the net assets of overseas operations are dealt with through reserves and are reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
32 the sixth sense of business Revenue recognition Revenue and profits on short-term projects are recognised on the completion of the project once the product has been delivered to the customer.
Costs incurred on these projects up to completion are included within work-in-progress.
Revenue and profits on continuous and other projects are recognised on the satisfactory completion of each phase of the project once the service or product has been delivered to the customer.
Costs incurred on these projects are included within work-in-progress until completion of each phase.
Amounts invoiced to clients in advance of revenue and profits being recognised are shown as payments received on account within creditors.
Provisions are made for losses on projects as soon as they are identified.
Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at the lower of cost or their recoverable amount, which is determined as the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
Tangible and intangible fixed assets Fixed assets are stated at original cost or, where appropriate, fair value when acquired, less accumulated depreciation.
Assets under construction consist of costs directly attributable to purchasing and installing tangible fixed assets ahead of their productive use.
External and internal costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benefits of the business.
Internal costs are only capitalised if they are also incremental to the group.
Provisions are made and charged to the profit and loss account where the value of assets has been impaired in relation to their value-in-use to the business.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of each asset on a straight-line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Freehold land no depreciation Freehold buildings 33 years Short leasehold land and buildings period of lease Patents, licences and other 20 years or remaining life if shorter Goodwill 20 years or estimated useful economic life if shorter Software and databases 5 years or remaining life if shorter Leasehold improvements 10 years or period of lease if shorter Equipment 3 10 years No depreciation is charged on assets under construction until they are brought into use by the business.
Finance and operating leases Assets held under finance leases and hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated over their useful lives, or the term of the lease if shorter, at the rate applicable to fixed assets of a similar category owned by the group.
Rentals under operating leases are charged directly to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Work-in-progress Work-in-progress is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes direct costs incurred on incomplete client projects and an appropriate element of specifically attributable overheads.
Current asset investments Current asset investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pension arrangements The group operates a number of contributory pension plans.
The majority of employees participate in defined contribution plans that are set up through insurance companies.
Contributions are also made to personal pension plans at equivalent rates.
Payments in respect of such current service contributions for defined contribution plans and personal pension plans are charged in the financial statements as they fall due.
The group also operates defined benefit plans which provide pensions based on final salaries and accounts for them under SSAP 24.
The expected cost of pensions in respect of these plans is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the service lives of employees in the plans.
Variations from the regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees in the plan.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified independent actuaries.
Employee share ownership plans see remuneration report on pages 73 to 80 Shares in Taylor Nelson Sofres plc held by the Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and the Employee Benefit Trust EBT are shown as a deduction in arriving at shareholders funds.
Costs of administration are included in the profit and loss account as they accrue.
Profits arising on the disposal of shares held by the EBT as a result of the exercise of options are taken to other reserves.
33 the sixth sense of business Bank facility arrangement fees Bank facility arrangement fees are capitalised and charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the bank facilities.
Provisions A provision is recognised when there is a present obligation, whether legal or constructive, as a result of a past event for which it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Deferred consideration Where acquisitions involve further payments that are deferred or contingent on levels of performance achieved in the years following acquisition, the profit and loss account is charged with notional interest to eliminate the benefit, which the group is temporarily saving.
The notional interest charged is calculated by reference to the period of deferral, current interest rates and the amount of the likely payments.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Tax deferred or accelerated by the effect of timing differences is accounted for to the extent that a transaction or event that has occurred at the balance sheet date gives rise to an obligation to pay more tax or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits will arise from which the reversal of the asset can be deducted.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings.
Receipts and payments on such instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
The group also uses forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures.
Further details are provided in note 19.

Non-audit fees for due diligence services capitalised in the year were 0.5m 2003 2.0m.
Administrative costs for continuing activities were 550.5m 2003 469.3m.
This includes exceptional administrative costs of 9.8m 2003 9.0m, which have been incurred in relation to the integration of NFO.
The costs arise from the merger of businesses around the group and include staff severance costs, vacant property provisions and other charges.

The group expects to use these losses in the foreseeable future.
There are no unprovided deferred tax liabilities in the company or group.
Deferred tax assets of 1.0m 2003 2.3m in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufficient certainty over their recoverability.
There are no other factors expected to affect the groups tax rate going forward.

As the earnings are continually reinvested by the group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws substantially enacted at the balance sheet date.
7Profit for the year As permitted under section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the parent companys profit and loss account has not been included in these financial statements.
The retained profit after dividends for the year was 5.7m 2003 loss of 31.4m.

The amount waived in respect of the 2004 interim dividend was 8,000 2003 17,000 and the maximum to be waived in respect of the 2004 final dividend on shares currently held by the ESOP is 16,000 2003 36,000.
The trustees of the EBT have also waived their right to all but 0.001p per share of the dividends due on the 6.2 million shares the EBT holds at 31 December 2004, until further notice.
The amount waived in respect of the 2004 interim dividend was 79,000 2003 62,000 and the maximum to be waived in respect of the 2004 final dividend on shares currently held by the EBT is 148,000 2003 106,000.
The final proposed dividend does not include a dividend on shares issued on the exercise of employee share options and allotment of new shares since 31 December 2004 or on other options, which may be exercised prior to 27 May 2005, the record date.
38 the sixth sense of business 9 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share have been calculated on the profit after taxation and minority interests of 20.2m 2003 11.8m and on 437.6 million shares 2003 413.1 million, being the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the ESOP and the EBT, which are treated as cancelled.
The diluted earnings per share have been calculated in accordance with the provisions of FRS 14, with the weighted average number of shares in issue being adjusted to assume conversion of all potentially dilutive shares for the period they were outstanding.
Shares held by the ESOP and the EBT, which are under performance-based options, are included in the diluted weighted average number of shares as the performance conditions are deemed to have been met for the purposes of this calculation.
The diluted weighted average number of shares is 446.6 million 2003 419.0 million.
Adjusted earnings per share before goodwill charges, integration costs and exceptional finance charges have been calculated on the profit after taxation and minority interests of 55.5m 2003 42.4m, which excludes goodwill charges of 27.8m 2003 23.9m and integration costs and exceptional finance charges of 7.5m net of tax 2003 6.7m net of tax and on the basic weighted average number of shares.
The directors believe that earnings per share before goodwill charges and exceptional items assists in understanding the underlying performance of the group.
The weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year for the purpose of these calculations is as follows: 2004 2003 Weighted average number of shares millions Share capital 445.1 421.6 Shares held by ESOP 1.1 1.9 Shares held by EBT 6.4 6.6 Basic earnings per share denominator 437.6 413.1 Dilutive effect of share options 9.0 5.9 Dilutive earnings per share denominator 446.6 419.0 10 Intangible fixed assets Patents and Goodwill licences Other Total Group Notes m m m m Cost At 1 January 2004 428.2 4.7 1.7 434.6 Additions 12 20.6 0.2 20.8 Reclassifications 0.3 0.3 Disposals 0.5 1.0 1.5 Exchange differences 13.3 13.3 At 31 December 2004 435.0 5.0 0.6 440.6 Amortisation At 1 January 2004 60.5 2.2 0.8 63.5 Charge for year 23.7 0.4 0.2 24.3 Impairment 3.5 3.5 Disposals 0.9 0.9 Exchange differences 1.8 1.8 At 31 December 2004 85.9 2.6 0.1 88.6 Net book value At 31 December 2004 349.1 2.4 0.5 352.0 At 31 December 2003 367.7 2.5 0.9 371.1 In accordance with FRS 11 Impairment of fixed assets and goodwill, the carrying value of the goodwill held in respect of a number of the groups subsidiary undertakings has been compared with their recoverable amounts represented by their value in use to the group.
The review has resulted in an impairment charge of 3.3m in respect of TNS Gallup Mexico and other impairments totalling 0.2m 2003 impairments of 6.5m.
The discount rate used in the calculations to arrive at the valuations is 10.0% 2003 9.0%.

Deferred consideration represents amounts that the group is contractually bound to pay in the future for acquisitions.
The amounts are determined by future results of the acquired businesses.
The provisions are determined with reference to the latest information available and are expected to be paid within one to three years of the balance sheet date.
Deferred consideration of 5.5m $10m relating to the acquisition of NFO, which was provided at 31 December 2003, was paid during the year.
Pension provisions are calculated from actuarial valuations of defined benefit plans or retirement benefit plans across the group.
The provisions will be satisfied over the current service lives of employees.
Post employment benefit provisions are calculated from actuarial valuations of post retirement benefit plans across the group and will be satisfied over the lives of the members.
The total pensions and other post employment benefits provision of 13.5m at 31 December 2004 2003 12.4m consists of 8.7m 2003 7.8m of pension provisions, 2.3m 2003 1.8m of post retirement benefits and 2.5m 2003 2.8m of statutory severance provisions payable when staff leave in certain territories.
Restructuring provisions of 3.9m have been reclassified to other provisions as at 1 January 2004.
Vacant property and onerous lease provisions represent the net rental cost to the group of empty leasehold properties and the net rent in excess of market rents for properties acquired with NFO up to the end of the relevant lease periods.
The provisions are expected to be utilised by 2013.
Panel incentives represent amounts payable to panellists after their participation in panels research.
Amounts are estimated based on the value of incentives earned and are expected to be satisfied within one to two years.
Other provisions consist of liabilities arising as a result of ongoing litigation or claims and other amounts that are not individually material to the group.
The amounts are expected to be paid within one to five years.
No provisions are held by the company as at 31 December 2004.
During the year, 5.5m in relation to deferred consideration was utilised.
47 the sixth sense of business 19 Financial instruments TNS operates a central treasury function providing services to the group.
It arranges loans and funding, invests surplus liquidity and manages financial risk.
Group Treasury is not a profit centre and no speculative trades are permitted or executed.
It operates within specific policies, agreed by the board, to control and monitor financial risk within the group and reports regularly to the board against these policy requirements.
Monthly reports to the board summarise new Treasury activity and measures of effectiveness.
Prudent and controlled use is made of financial instruments where appropriate, principally to reduce fluctuation in interest costs.
Forward exchange contracts and options are used to reduce fluctuation in exchange rates.
Transactions are effected with relationship banks as counter parties.
For the purposes of the disclosures, which follow in this note, short term debtors and creditors and provisions, which arise directly from the groups operations, have been excluded as permitted under FRS 13.
The disclosures therefore focus on those financial instruments that play a significant medium to long term role in the financial risk profile of the group.
An analysis of the carrying value of all financial assets and liabilities is given in the fair value table on page 51.
Currency risk The groups principal exposures to exchange rate fluctuations arise on the translation of overseas net assets and profits into sterling for accounting purposes.
The principal foreign currencies for the group are euro and US dollar.
The groups transactional foreign exchange exposure results mainly from sales and purchases of services between members of the group and is hedged by matching cash flows through a netting process.
Any minor residual exposures are covered on a short term basis by spot or forward exchange contracts.
These are revalued at the closing exchange rate with the net unrealised gains and losses being matched to the underlying transactions being hedged.
Translation exposures arising on consolidation of the groups overseas net assets are minimised by broadly matching assets with borrowings in each major foreign currency.
This provides a hedge against currency fluctuations by matching currency loans with the underlying assets in the same currency.
The net movement in exchange reserves after the effect of hedging is a loss of 6.6m after taxation 2003 loss of 19.4m.
Interest rate risk The group has an exposure to variations in interest rates on its borrowings and manages these by fixing debt through drawings of loans for extended periods and the use of interest rate hedging products such as swaps and forward rate agreements.
Group Treasury policy requires between 25% and 75% of borrowings to be maintained at fixed rates.
Net debt at 31 December 2004 was 335.1m 2003 367.7 m. The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings.
Receipts and payments on such instruments are recognised on an accruals basis, over the life of the instrument.
A 1% rise in interest rates would affect the overall interest charge as follows: Sterling, 0.1m increase 2003 no change : USD, 0.2m increase 2003 0.4m increase : euro, 0.5m increase 2003 0.6m increase.
Liquidity risk The group maintains a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective structure.
Policy therefore dictates at least 20% capacity based on current debt profile be maintained.
At 31 December 2004, 460m 2003 490m of committed facilities and 52m 2003 53m of uncommitted facilities were available to the group.

Gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting has been used The group matches currency assets to funding loans in the same or closely related currency.
Under SSAP 20, any residue is passed to reserves.
10.3m of net exchange gains on foreign currency loans 2003 9.5m have been offset in reserves against exchange losses on the net investment in overseas subsidiaries of 18.9m 2003 28.9m.
20 Pensions and similar obligations The group operates a number of pension and post retirement benefit plans for its employees throughout the world, as well as complying with local laws and regulations relating to the payment of retirement benefits.
The assets of all funded pension plans are held separately from those of the group.
Total provisions in respect of the groups pension and post retirement benefit plans are shown in note 18.
UK The pension plans in the UK are primarily defined contribution plans and the groups contribution to such plans ranges from 4% to 8% of salary, rising with the age of employees.
There are two defined benefit plans, which are closed to new members and future accruals.
The plans were valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2003 and 2004 using the projected unit method.
The market value of assets of these plans was 3.7m, which represented 112% of the benefits that have accrued to members.
The principal assumptions were discount rates of 5.0% and 6.0% and that salary increases would be 4.0% and 3.0% per annum respectively.
Pensions increases were assumed to be nil.
The cost in the year for defined contribution plans was 2.7m 2003 1.9m and for defined benefit plans was nil 2003 nil.
At the year end, there were 0.2m 2003 nil of outstanding contributions in relation to the defined contribution plans in the UK.
51 the sixth sense of business 20 Pensions and similar obligations continued France Companies in France participate in state compulsory arrangements.
Regulations in France require that a lump sum be paid to employees on retirement, based on their final salary and the number of years service.
During 2004 the regulations and benefits were changed and the state retirement age increased from 60 to 65.
The impact of the changes is being spread over the service life of employees.
The provisions required to meet these amounts were assessed by independent qualified actuaries in 2004 and provision has been made for the 2.1m 2003 2.1m liability identified.
Movements in the liability are charged or credited to the profit and loss account in the year they are identified and the cost in the year was 0.5m 2003 0.2m.
US There are defined contribution pension plans in operation in the US, where the group undertakes to pay a contribution based on amounts paid by employees up to a maximum.
Costs are charged to the profit and loss account in the period they are incurred.
The group also operates three defined benefit plans including the NFOR plan, which was acquired with the NFO acquisition.
The NFOR plan was valued in 2004 by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
Principal assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.75% and salary increases of 3.50% per annum.
The market value of assets of this plan was 6.7m which represented 58% of the accrued benefits.
During the year, the benefits were frozen and no future benefits will accrue to members reducing future obligations significantly.
The CMR plan was valued by independent qualified actuaries in 2003 using the unit credit method.
The market value of assets of this plan was 1.2m, which represented 175% of the accrued benefits.
The cost in the year for defined contribution plans was 0.2m 2003 0.2m and for defined benefit plans was 1.0m 2003 0.5m.
Provision has been made for 4.6m 2003 6.3m in total for US defined benefit plans.
At the year end, there were 0.1m 2003 0.1m of outstanding contributions in relation to the defined contibution plans in the US.
There are also unfunded post retirement healthcare and life assurance plans, which were acquired with NFO.
Liabilities have been calculated by independent qualified actuaries in 2004 using actuarial valuations.
Principal assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.75% and salary increases of 3.50% per year.
During the year eligibility conditions were changed to reduce the number of employees benefiting from the plans.
In addition, prescription drug benefits will no longer be payable and a Medicare subsidy will be received from 2006, all of which will reduce the cost in future years.
The cost in the year was 0.2m 2003 0.1m.
Assumed healthcare inflation rates are 9% at 31 December 2004 grading down to 5% in 2009 and thereafter.
At the year end, the provision for post retirement healthcare and life assurance plans was 2.0m 2003 1.8m.
Netherlands The group operates a defined benefit plan in the Netherlands.
This plan is insured, although indexation increases to pensions in payment remain the responsibility of the company.
Provision for these indexation increases is made based on actuarial assessments made by independent qualified actuaries in 2004 using the projected unit method.
The principal assumptions used were a discount rate of 5.15% and that salary increases would be 4.0% per annum.
Pension increases were assumed to be 2.0%.
There is also an early retirement plan whereby employees in the scheme can retire early and receive payments before the usual retirement age.
Both plans were amended in 2004 to reduce the benefit obligation in the future.
The provision required to meet these liabilities was assessed by independent actuaries in 2004 and 0.7m 2003 0.9m was provided at the year end.
The cost of these plans in the year was 1.2m 2003 1.3m.
Other countries Where there are local requirements to provide lump sum payments at the time employees retire, provision has been made for the liabilities identified based on local actuarial assessments.
The cost in the year for these plans and other small pensions and post retirement benefit plans was 1.2m 2003 0.5m and provisions have been made for liabilities of 4.1m 2003 3.1m.
