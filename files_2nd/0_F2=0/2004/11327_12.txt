Financial instruments and derivatives Treasury policies and the management of risk The function of Group Treasury is to reduce or eliminate financial risk, to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable requirements, to secure finance at minimum cost and to invest cash assets securely and profitably.
Treasury operations manage the Groups funding, liquidity and exposure to interest rate risks within a framework of policies and guidelines authorised by the Board.
The Group uses derivative instruments for risk management purposes only.
Consistent with Group policy, Group Treasury do not engage in speculative activity and it is policy to avoid using the more complex financial instruments.
The policy followed in managing credit risk permits only minimal exposures with banks and other institutions meeting required standards as assessed normally by reference to the major credit agencies.
Deals are authorised only with banks with which dealing mandates have been agreed and which maintain a Double A rating.
Individual aggregate credit exposures are limited accordingly.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from the analysis below.
At 30 April 2004 the Groups total borrowings were 295,986,000 2003 299,923,000. Financing and interest rate risk The Groups policy is to finance operating subsidiary undertakings by a combination of retained earnings, bank borrowings including medium term loans and hire purchase finance.
Cash at bank and on deposit yield interest based principally on LIBOR rates applicable to periods of less than three months.
The Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations on its borrowings and deposits is managed through the use of interest rate caps, collars and swaps.
These derivatives are also used to manage the Groups desired mix of fixed and floating rate debt.
The policy is to fix or cap a substantial element of the interest cost on outstanding debt.
At 30 April 2004, 76% of gross borrowings were at fixed or capped rates of interest: 85,000,000 of swaps as shown below and 140,000,000 of caps and collars as detailed on page 37.
After taking into account the various interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate exposure of the borrowings of the Group as at 30 April 2004 was: Fixed rate borrowings Weighted Weighted average average Gross Floating rate Fixed rate interest rate time for which borrowings borrowings borrowings at year end rate is fixed 000 000 000 % Years At 30 April 2004 UK Sterling 295,986 210,986 85,000 5.29 3.86 At 30 April 2003 UK Sterling 299,923 269,923 30,000 7.05 4.14 The analysis of weighted average interest rates and weighted average years to maturity is on fixed rate borrowings and after adjustments for interest rate swaps.
The floating rate borrowings bear interest at relevant national LIBOR equivalents.
