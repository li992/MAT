During the year, the Group granted a number of share options under the Executive Share Option Scheme 1999 to certain employees at the market value of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
These shares are exercisable between three and ten years from the date of the grant.
Exercise of a proportion of these shares is subject to share price performance criteria.
Discounts on options granted under the Groups Savings Related Share Option Scheme do not attract a profit and loss charge as permitted by UITF17.
The Group has provided for the expected National Insurance liability arising on its unapproved 1999 Scheme.
It is estimated that if the share price were to increase by 10%, this would lead to a 204,000 increase, being 200,000 in relation to the increase in share price and 4,000 due to additional share options becoming eligible for exercise.
Similarly, if the share price were to decrease by 10% this would lead to a 200,000 reduction in the provision, being 200,000 in relation to the decrease in the share price and nil due to share options becoming no longer eligible for exercise.

Dividends on the shares owned by the trust, the purchase of which was funded by an interest free loan to the trust from Northgate Information Solutions plc, are waived.
All expenses incurred by the trust are settled directly by Northgate Information Solutions UK Limited and are charged to the accounts as incurred.
In accordance with UITF13, the difference between the book value and the option exercise price of shares appropriated by the trust for issue to employees under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme is being charged as an operating cost over the period of service of the employees.

The cost of the Company's investment in the transferor subsidiary reflected the underlying fair value of its net assets and goodwill at the time of acquisition.
As a result of this transfer, the value of the Company's investment in the transferor subsidiary fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Company's accounting records.
Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 requires that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Company's profit and loss account.
However, as the fall in value of the investment in the transferor subsidiary undertaking was offset by an increase in the value of the investment in the transferee subsidiary, the Directors consider that, as there has been no overall loss to the Company, it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Company's profit and loss account for the year.
The effect of this departure is to increase the Company's profit for the financial year by 2,425,000 and to increase the value of investments in subsidiary undertakings in the holding company's balance sheet by the same amount.
The Group accounts are not affected by this transfer.

PENSION COMMITMENTS The Group operates two defined benefit pension schemes, one of which was inherited through the acquisition of Rebus HR Group Limited.
Both are now closed to new members.
The Groups principal UK operating company, Northgate Information Solutions UK Limited, operates a defined benefit scheme for its employees whose benefits are related to salary close to retirement or leaving service if earlier and also to years of pensionable service, with the assets held in a separate, trustee administered fund.
The contributions to the scheme are determined on the basis of regular valuations undertaken by independent, qualified actuaries.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was conducted as at 31 March 2002 using the projected unit method.
As at that date, the market value of the assets was 90.4 million and on the valuation assumptions, these assets were sufficient to cover 97% of the liabilities.
The key valuation assumptions relate to the rates of return on investments and rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
The pension cost in the accounts includes the regular cost plus a variation in cost and, for the purposes of producing Company accounting information, calculations were produced as at 30 April 2002 and the following assumptions were used: % p. a.
Investment return before retirement 6.25 Salary increases 3.00 Pension increases for service from April 1997 2.70 Pension increases in excess of GMPs, for service up to April 1997 2.50 The total pension cost of this defined benefit scheme charged to the profit and loss account for the year to 30 April 2004 was 2,266,000 2003: 1,801,000 which includes an addition for the amortisation of the experience deficit of 1,599,000 2003: 907,000.
Following a review in 2002 of the Groups pension arrangements, the Group closed this defined benefit pension scheme to new members, replacing it with a defined contribution scheme.
Existing members were given the option to stay in the scheme but future benefits will accrue at 1 70th of final salary for each year of service against the prior rate of 1 60th of final salary.
Employee contributions increased from 5% to 8% of pensionable salary going forward.
The Group also operates various defined contribution schemes for its other UK and overseas employees.
NORTHGATE INFORMATION SOLUTIONS PLC 54 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS 29.
PENSION COMMITMENTS continued The pension cost figures used in these accounts comply with the current pension cost accounting standard SSAP24.
A new pension cost accounting standard, IAS19, must be used for the figures that will be shown in the accounts at 30 April 2006 and subsequent years.
Under transitional arrangements, the Company is required to disclose the following information about the scheme and the figures that would have been shown under the UK standard FRS17 in the current balance sheet.
Employer contributions to the defined benefit part of the scheme during the year amounted to 2,266,000.
This represents broadly 13.6% of members Pensionable Salaries.
The contributions paid to the defined contribution section of the scheme amounted to 271,000.

The most recent actuarial valuation of the scheme was conducted as at 1st April 2002 using the projected unit method.
As at that date, the market value of the assets was 58.3 million and, on the valuation assumptions, these assets were sufficient to cover 77% of the liabilities.
Currently, Company contributions to the scheme are 18.2% of pensionable salaries plus the cost of life assurance and less members standard contributions plus 0.5 million per annum.
In accordance with FRS7 fair values in acquisition accounting, a provision of 18,000,000 representing the deficit in the scheme was adopted as at 23 January 2004.
A related deferred tax asset of 450,000 has been included in these accounts.

PENSION COMMITMENTS continued The total pension cost of the defined benefit scheme charged to the profit and loss account for the period 23 January 2004 to 30 April 2004 was 743,000 which includes an addition for the amortisation of the experience deficit of 136,000.
Provisions for liabilities and charges include 17,813,000 at 30 April 2004 in respect of pension costs representing the cumulative difference between pension costs charged to the profit and loss account and the amounts funded.
The company also operates various defined contribution schemes for its other UK and overseas employees.
An estimate of the liabilities of the defined benefit scheme was updated to 23 January 2004 and 30 April 2004, by an independent qualified actuary in accordance with the transitional arrangements of FRS17.
As required by FRS17, the defined benefit liabilities have been measured using the projected unit method.
The scheme is closed to new entrants and, under the method used to calculate pension costs in accordance with FRS17, the cost as a percentage of payroll will tend to increase as the average age of the membership increases.
Over the period 23 January 2004 to 30 April 2004, contributions by the Company of 743,000 were made to the defined benefit scheme.

c Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities The carrying amounts of all financial assets and financial liabilities are not materially different from their estimated fair values.
d Hedging The effect of the Groups two interest collar arrangements is to limit the risk to the Group of fluctuating interest rates: i On 26 September 2003, the Group took out a collar arrangement in respect of the funding for the purchase of the freehold of the Groups headquarters.
The arrangement commenced with a notional principal sum of 12.0 million reducing quarterly over a 10 year period.
Interest is payable on the notional sum at a rate equal to the 3 month LIBOR rate as at each quarterly reset date, and is capped at 6% with a floor of 4.37%.
The arrangement ceases in September 2013.
The effect of the arrangement is to limit interest payable on the part of the bank loans equal to the notional principal to a range between the cap rate and the floor rate.
ii On 3 February 2004, the Group took out a second collar arrangement in respect of borrowings to assist in funding the purchase of Rebus HR Group Limited and with the Groups working capital and other requirements.
The arrangement commenced with a notional principal sum of 20.0 million, reducing to 16.0 million on 3 February 2005 and 7.0 million on 3 February 2006.
Interest is payable on the notional sum at a rate equal to the 3 month LIBOR rate as at each quarterly reset date on the notional sum, and is capped at 5% with a floor of 4.25%.
The arrangement ceases in February 2007.
The effect of the arrangement is to limit interest payable on the part of the bank borrowings equal to the notional principal to a range between the cap rate and the floor rate.
e Foreign currency profile The Group has some transactional currency exposures.
Such exposures mainly arise from sales or purchases in currencies other than the Groups functional currencies.
These exposures represent less than 5% of the turnover of the Group.
Based on current levels of exposure, the Group believes that this risk is generally manageable without the need for hedging of these transactions.
The Group has the ability where it is considered appropriate on a case by case basis for significant individual transactions to enter into forward foreign currency contracts.
There were no forward foreign currency contracts undertaken in the year 2003: none.
The table below sets out monetary assets and liabilities held in the Groups non-functional currencies.
Foreign exchange differences on retranslation of these assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account of the group companies and the Group.
