The accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.
91 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Accounting policies Bases of accounting and consolidation The accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, modified by the revaluation of certain land and buildings, and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
The group accounts include the accounts of the company and its subsidiary undertakings subsidiaries together with the groups attributable share of the results of joint arrangements and associated undertakings associates.
Unless otherwise stated, the acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiaries sold or acquired are included in the profit and loss account up to, or from, the date control passes.
Acquisitions and disposals On the acquisition of a business, or of an interest in an associate, fair values, reflecting conditions at the date of acquisition, are attributed to the net assets including significant owned brands acquired.
Adjustments to fair values include those made to bring accounting policies into line with those of the group.
Where merger relief is applicable under the UK CompaniesActs, the difference between the fair value of the business acquired and the nominal value of shares issued as purchase consideration is treated as a merger reserve.
The profit and loss on the disposal of a previously acquired business includes the attributable amount of purchased goodwill relating to that business, including any goodwill written off direct to reserves prior to 1 July 1998.
Brands, goodwill and other intangible assets When the cost of an acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the groups share of the net assets acquired, the difference is treated as purchased goodwill.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions subsequent to 1 July 1998 is capitalised but prior to that date it was eliminated against reserves, and this goodwill has not been restated.
Acquired brands and other intangible assets which are controlled through custody or legal rights and could be sold separately from the rest of the business are capitalised, where fair value can be reliably measured.
Where capitalised goodwill and intangible assets are regarded as having limited useful economic lives, their cost is amortised on a straightline basis over those lives up to 20 years.
Where goodwill and intangible assets are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives, they are not amortised.
Assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment annually and other assets are reviewed for impairment wherever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.
Impairment reviews, comparing the discounted estimated future operating cash flows with the net carrying value of brands or goodwill, are carried out to ensure that goodwill and intangible assets are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
Amortisation and any impairment write downs are charged to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Land and buildings are stated at cost or, for certain assets acquired prior to 1993, at professional valuation, less depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Leaseholds are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease.
Other tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straightline basis to estimated residual values over their expected useful lives within the following ranges: industrial and other buildings 10 to 50 years: plant and machinery 5 to 25 years: fixtures and fittings 5 to 10 years: casks and containers 15 to 20 years: and computer software up to 5 years.
Reviews are carried out if there is some indication that impairment may have occurred, to ensure that fixed assets are not carried at above their recoverable amounts.
Leases Where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset subject to a lease, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
Other leases are treated as operating leases, with payments and receipts taken to the profit and loss account on a straightline basis over the life of the lease.
Associates and joint arrangements An associate is an undertaking in which the group has a long term equity interest and over which it exercises significant influence.
The groups interest in the net assets of associates is included in investments in the group balance sheet.
Joint arrangements, where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets and liabilities, measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
Share options The intrinsic value of options granted, being the difference between the market value of shares on the award of an option, and the exercise price of the option, is charged to the profit and loss account over the minimum life of the option.
Shares held by the company for the purpose of fulfilling obligations in respect of various employee share plans around the group are deducted from equity in the consolidated balance sheet.
Any gain or loss arising on the sale of the shares held by the company are included as an adjustment to reserves.
Stocks Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost includes raw materials, direct labour and expenses, and an appropriate proportion of production and other overheads.
Cost is calculated on an actual usage basis for maturing stocks and on a first in, first out basis for other stocks.
92 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Accounting policies Foreign currencies The profit and loss accounts and cash flows of overseas subsidiaries and associates are translated into sterling at weighted average rates of exchange, other than substantial transactions which are translated at the rate on the date of the transaction.
The adjustment to closing rates is taken to reserves.
Balance sheets are translated at closing rates.
Exchange differences arising on the re-translation at closing rates of the opening balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries and associates are taken to reserves, as are exchange differences arising on related foreign currency borrowings and financial instruments.
Tax charges and credits arising on such items are also taken to reserves.
Other exchange differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
The results, assets and liabilities of operations in hyper-inflationary economies are determined using an appropriate relatively stable currency as the functional currency.
The exchange differences arising from this initial process are taken to the profit and loss account.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction or, if hedged forward, at the rate of exchange under the related foreign currency contract.
Turnover Turnover from the sale of goods includes excise duties and royalties receivable but excludes value added tax.
Turnover is recognised depending upon individual customer terms at the time of despatch, delivery or some other specified point when the risk of loss transfers.
Provision is made for returns where appropriate.
Turnover is stated net of price discounts, allowances for customer loyalty and certain promotional activities and similar items.
Advertising Advertising production costs are charged to the profit and loss account when the advertisement is first shown to the public.
Research and development Research and development, including developing new drinks products and package design expenditure, is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
Pensions and other post employment benefits The groups principal pension funds are defined benefit plans.
In addition the group has defined contribution plans, unfunded post employment medical benefit liabilities and other unfunded post employment liabilities.
For defined benefit plans the amount charged to operating profit is the cost of accruing pension benefits promised to employees over the year plus any benefit improvements granted to members by the group during the year.
Other finance charges income in the profit and loss account includes a credit equivalent to the groups expected return on the pension plansassets over the year, offset by a charge equal to the expected increase in the plansliabilities over the year.
The difference between the market value of the plansassets and the present value of the plansliabilities is disclosed as an asset or liability on the group balance sheet, net of deferred tax to the extent that it is recoverable.
Any differences between the expected return on assets and that actually achieved, and any changes in the liabilities over the year due to changes in assumptions or experience within the plans, are recognised in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Contributions payable by the group in respect of defined contribution plans are charged to operating profit as incurred.
Exceptional items Exceptional items are those that in managements judgement need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incidence.
Such items are included within the profit and loss account caption to which they relate, and are separately disclosed either in the notes to the consolidated financial statements or on the face of the consolidated profit and loss account.
Deferred taxation Full provision for deferred tax is made for timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the consolidated financial statements and their recognition in tax computations, using current tax rates.
The group does not discount these balances.
No deferred tax is provided in respect of any future remittance of earnings of foreign subsidiaries or associates where no commitment has been made to remit such earnings.
Financial instruments The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
Instruments accounted for as hedges are structured so as to reduce the market risk associated with the underlying transaction being hedged and are designated as a hedge at the inception of the contract.
If the underlying transaction to a hedge ceases to exist, the hedge is terminated and the profit or loss is recognised immediately.
If the hedge transaction is terminated, the profit or loss is held in the balance sheet and amortised over the life of the original underlying transaction.
Receipts and payments on interest rate instruments are recognised on an accruals basis over the life of the instrument.
Foreign exchange contracts hedging net investments in overseas businesses are revalued at closing rates and exchange differences arising are taken to reserves.
Gains and losses on contracts hedging forecast transactional cash flows, and on option instruments hedging the sterling value of foreign currency denominated income, are recognised in the hedged periods.
Cash flows associated with derivative financial instruments are classified in the cash flow statement in a manner consistent with those of the transactions being hedged.
Finance costs associated with debt issuances are charged to the profit and loss account over the life of the issue.
93 Diageo Annual Report 2004 Notes to the consolidated financial statements Diageo was created by the merger of the former GrandMet and Guinness Group businesses on 17 December 1997.
Under generally accepted accounting principles GAAP in the United Kingdom, the combination has been accounted for as a merger and the results and cash flows of GrandMet and the Guinness Group are combined as of the beginning of the earliest financial year presented.
Under US GAAP the merger has been accounted for as an acquisition of the Guinness Group by GrandMet.
At the time of the merger, Diageo changed its year end to 30 June.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from those estimates.
1 New UK GAAP accounting policies The group has adopted the reporting requirements of FRS 17 Retirement benefits in its primary financial statements from 1 July 2003.
In prior years, the group complied with the transitional disclosure requirements of the standard.
The financial information included in these statements also complies from 1 July 2003 with the following requirements issued by the UKs Accounting Standards Board: UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, and the amendment to FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions.
In the primary financial statements and all relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements, the comparative information has been restated as appropriate.
FRS 17 Retirement benefits This standard replaces the use of the actuarial values for assessing pension costs in favour of a market-based approach.
In order to cope with the volatility inherent in this measurement basis, the standard requires that the profit and loss account shows the relatively stable ongoing service cost, the expected return on assets and the interest on the liabilities.
Differences between expected and actual returns on assets, and the impact on the liabilities of changes in the assumptions, are reflected in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
The adoption of FRS 17 has decreased the reported operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2003 by 88 million 2002 128 million, including 17 million of exceptional operating costs.
This charge has been offset by a decrease in non-operating exceptional charges of 14 million 2002 exceptional income decrease of 8 million and an increase in other finance income of 36 million 2002 104 million, giving a net decrease in the profit for the year of 38 million 2002 32 million.
In addition, the adoption of the standard has reduced investment in associates by 119 million, debtors by 659 million, provisions by 221 million and minority interests by 4 million, increased stocks by 57 million and created a net post employment liability of 1,369 million.
In aggregate the adoption of FRS 17 has reduced shareholdersfunds at 30 June 2003 by 1,865 million.
For the year ended 30 June 2003, the charge to operating profit for employers pension cost and other post employment costs, calculated in accordance with SSAP 24 Pensions costs, was 22 million.
It is not practicable to calculate the equivalent charge under SSAP 24 for the year ended 30 June 2004 in view of the numerous pension plans around the world, the complexity of the calculations and the number of assumptions required to be made.
UITF abstract 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts This abstract changes the presentation of an entitys own shares held in an employee share trust from requiring them to be recognised as assets to requiring them to be deducted in arriving at shareholdersfunds.
It also has consequential changes to UITF 17 requiring that the expense to the profit and loss account should be the difference between the fair value of the shares at the date of award and the amount that an employee is required to pay for the shares i. e. the intrinsic valueof the award.
The impact of the adoption of UITF 38 in the year ended 30 June 2003 has been to increase operating profit by 14 million 2002 5 million and increase the tax charge by 4 million 2002 1 million.
In addition, exceptional charges were reduced by 2 million, giving a net increase in the profit for the year of 12 million 2002 4 million.
The reclassification of shares acquired by the share trust own shares from fixed asset investments 259 million and debtors 29 million to equity has reduced shareholdersfunds by 288 million at 30 June 2003.
In addition, the net cash outflow arising from the purchase of shares by the share trusts has been reclassified from capital expenditure and financial investmentto financing.
The charge to operating profit for the year ended 30 June 2004 under the previous guidance, UITF abstract 13 Accounting for ESOP Trusts, would have been approximately 25 million, compared with 15 million under UITF 38.
FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions The amendment to the standard added a new application note G on revenue recognition.
This requires that revenue should be stated at fair value of the right to consideration.
Diageo incurs certain promotional expenditure where permitted under local law for example, slotting fees, whereby fees are paid to retailers for prominence of display, listing or agreement not to delist Diageos products that is not wholly independent of the invoiced product price.
Such expenditure is now deducted from turnover.
The change, which has no impact on operating profit, reduced turnover and operating costs by 159 million in the year ended 30 June 2003 2002 382 million and by 181 million in the year ended 30 June 2004.

The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The larger plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Canada.
All valuations were performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit method to determine pension costs.
There are also a number of defined contribution plans and other post employment liabilities which are included in the figures given below.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benefits in respect of medical costs.

The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
To reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 3.25% per year as at 30 June 2004 2003 3%: 2002 3%: 2001 2.5% in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
These risk premia are long term assumptions and were set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, i. e. by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
The groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by Diageo and, if relevant, the trustees of the plan, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the return on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention being that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term and be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual stock exposures.
