Pension obligations The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP 24.
FRS 17 accounting will become mandatory for the year ended 31 December 2005 until which time phased transitional disclosures are required which are detailed in note 13 b to the extent not already made in note 13 a. a SSAP 24 pension costs The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The principal schemes are in the UK and cover 95% of the Groups UK employees.
These schemes are of the defined benefit type with assets held in separate trustee administered funds and are funded.
In other countries benefits are determined in accordance with local practice and regulations and funding is provided on several bases.
As the overseas arrangements are relatively small when compared to the UK schemes more limited disclosure has been included.
The charge to the profit and loss account for the year in respect of pensions was 6.1m 2003: 7.2m.
Contributions to the schemes were 8.6m for the year 2003: 8.1m.
The latest actuarial valuation of the principal UK schemes was carried out by Watson Wyatt LLP, independent consulting actuaries, as at 5 October 2002 using the projected unit method.
For the purposes of assessing the pension costs under SSAP 24 the most significant long-term assumptions relating to the valuation of the schemes are that the annual rate of return on investments will be 7.4%, the annual increase in general salaries will be 4.2%, and that annual pension increases and the underlying rate of inflation will be 2.7%.
At 5 October 2002 the market value of the assets in the UK schemes was 225m and this was sufficient to cover 86.5% of the benefits that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings and equalisation of benefits for males and females.
The prepayment in excess of the actuarial deficit at 1 January 2003, which has been calculated by adjusting the deficit shown by the 5 October 2002 valuation, is being charged to the profit and loss account over the average remaining service lives of current employees.
Pension obligations continued b FRS 17 retirement benefits The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures is based on the most recent actuarial valuation as at 5 October 2002 as updated by Watson Wyatt to assess the liabilities of the scheme as at 31 December 2004 per the FRS 17 requirements.
Scheme assets are stated at their market value as at 31 December 2004.

The US Dollar fixed rate liabilities comprise the proportion of the 7.37% loan notes not covered by interest rate swaps.

Financial instruments continued e Hedging of currency exposures The Group does not actively seek to hedge its currency net asset position, though in seeking to match interest costs with trading income to hedge currency cash flows, an effective asset hedge often results.
The Group has substantial cross-border transactions which are denominated in currency other than that of the division carrying out the transaction.
In these circumstances the Group policy is to hedge short term movements in exchange rates by selling or purchasing the appropriate currency to cover specific transactions.
The principal exposures arise in the Groups UK manufacturing divisions who utilise foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign currency contracts to hedge their respective positions.
At 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 the Group had no significant unhedged currency exposures that would give rise to currency gains or losses in the profit and loss account.
f Fair value of Group financial instruments The table below details a comparison of the book and fair values of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Where there are no readily available market values to determine fair values, cash flows relating to the various instruments have been discounted at prevailing interest and exchange rates to give an estimate of fair value.

The Group does hedge currency exposures on committed sales and purchases through a mix of short term currency overdrafts note 23 c and forward foreign currency contracts.

During the year the Company purchased 1,985,284 shares on the open market with a nominal value of 0.2m to be held as treasury shares for consideration of 6.4m.
These shares have been deducted from shareholders funds and will be held until such time as the Board decides to cancel them, reissue them, or utilise them to satisfy share options.
The right to receive dividends has been waived.
In 2004 options were granted to employees under the Croda Savings-Related Share Option Scheme 1983 to subscribe for 206,080 ordinary shares at an option price of 226p per share and under the International Sharesave Scheme to subscribe for 194,862 shares at an option price of 226p per share.
No options were granted in 2004 under the Senior Executive Share Option Scheme.
During the year consideration of 1.9m was received on the exercise of options over 768,804 shares.
The options were satisfied with shares transferred from the Groups employee share trusts.
Since the year end a further 99,607 shares have been transferred from the schemes.
Preference share capital 2004 2003 000 000 The authorised, issued and fully paid preference share capital comprises 5.9% preference shares of 1 616 616 6.6% preference shares of 1 499 499 7.5% preference shares of 1 22 22 1,137 1,137 The preference shares carry no voting rights other than in certain circumstances affecting the rights of the preference shareholders, details of which are set out in the Companys articles of association.
