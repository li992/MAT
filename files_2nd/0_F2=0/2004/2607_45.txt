This reserve was reclassified as distributable, and included in the profit and loss account reserve, when the creditors of the Company as at the date of the capital reduction were settled in full, on 31 December 2003.
Based upon the market price for the Companys shares at the year end, the expected cumulative impact on Burberry Groups consolidated profit and loss account of the RSP and IPO Option Schemes is a charge of 15.7m 2003: 0.8m which would be taken direct to reserves.
However, as this will be offset by an increase in share capital and share premium, there will be no net impact on Burberry Groups consolidated Shareholders Funds.
Cumulative goodwill charged to reserves on acquisition before 1 April 1998 is 0.1m 2003: 0.1m.
