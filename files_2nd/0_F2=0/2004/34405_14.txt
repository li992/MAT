10 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS The Group has adopted FRS 17 Retirement Benefits during the year to 31 December 2004.
The impact of the change in policy is detailed in note 30, Prior Year Adjustment.
Defined Benefit Schemes Within the UK, the majority of employees are eligible to join one of two schemes, administered by British Vita Pension Fund Trustees Limited and British Vita SE & D Pension Fund Trustees Limited, which provide final salary related benefits from separately invested assets.
The schemes are funded in accordance with the recommendations of the consultant actuaries, Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The members of the schemes are contracted-in to the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme but members have the option of contracting-out via a Rebate Only Personal Pension Scheme.
All members receive an annual benefits statement, together with a copy of an annual report on the status of the appropriate scheme.
An actuarial valuation is undertaken every two years and the last valuation was performed at 31 March 2004 using the projected unit method.
Separate pension arrangements are still operated by some of the acquisitions made in prior years, the largest of which is the Hyperlast Limited Retirement Benefits Plan.
Defined benefit schemes are also provided to employees in France, Germany and Italy, supplementing the State pension provision.
In France a lump sum indemnity is provided to employees reaching normal retirement age.
This liability is unfunded except for partial insurance policies in French business units.
In Germany collective contracts provide for employees to receive either a single lump sum payment or a monthly pension on retirement and are unfunded.
The scheme in Italy is also unfunded.
Defined benefit pensions are provided to employees in the Netherlands, where funds are paid into third party insurance policies as benefits accrue.
These policies provide guaranteed investment returns and the insurer bears the primary risk of asset return and mortality.
Annual Report 2004 43 Notes to the Accounts continued 10 PENSION ARRANGEMENTS continued Insured Defined Benefit Schemes In Austria funds are insured through third parties with no investment risk borne by the Group.
For these policies, liabilities are recognised as benefits accrue and assets are held by third party providers.
Recognition of liabilities and funding of defined benefit and insured defined benefit schemes are made according to the advice of independent consulting actuaries who regularly review the various schemes.
Defined Contribution Schemes Defined contribution pension plans operate in the principal operations in the USA, Australia, Belgium and certain other countries.
Pension benefits are paid as lump sums or ongoing payments.
These benefits are funded and liabilities accounted for at the time that benefits accrue and all investment, mortality and other risk is borne by the employee.
Assets are held by third party providers.
UK Schemes The Groups principal two UK defined benefit pension schemes together with the Hyperlast Limited Retirement Benefits Plan are set out below.
The actuarial valuation described above has been updated at 31 December 2004 by a qualified actuary using revised assumptions that are consistent with the requirements of FRS 17.
Investments have been valued, for this purpose, at fair value.
The major assumptions for the actuarial valuation were: 2004 2003 2002 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.26% & 4.76% 4.66% & 5.16% 4.33% & 4.83% Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.76% & 3% 2.66% & 3% 2.33% & 3% Rate of increase in deferred pensions 2.76% 2.66% 2.33% Discount rate 5.29% 5.36% 5.60% Inflation assumption 2.76% 2.66% 2.33% The fair value of the assets in the schemes, the present value of the liabilities in the schemes and the expected rate of return at each balance sheet date were: 2004 2003 2002 %m %m %m Equities 7.37 149.5 6.65 172.7 6.50 138.6 Bonds 4.87 103.6 5.15 62.3 5.00 63.0 Property 7.37 0.3 6.65 0.2 6.50 - Total market value of assets 253.4 235.2 201.6 Present value of scheme liabilities 251.1 234.2 204.1 Scheme surplus deficit 2.3 1.0 2.5 Related deferred tax 0.7 0.3 0.7 Net pension asset liability 1.6 0.7 1.8 The contribution rate, subject to periodic review by the scheme actuary, is between 9% to 18% of pensionable salaries depending on the pension scheme, inclusive of the schemes directly meeting the administration and related costs.

The provisional fair value adjustments made on the acquisition of the businesses and subsidiary undertakings was 0.2m.
Prior to becoming a subsidiary undertaking, Vitafoam Canada was accounted for as an associate.
In accordance with FRS 2 Accounting for Subsidiary Undertakings, and in order to give a true and fair view, purchased goodwill has been calculated as the sum of the goodwill arising on each separate purchase of shares in Vitafoam Canada.
Goodwill arising represents the difference at the date of each purchase between the fair value of the consideration given and the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities attributable to the interest purchased.
This represents a departure from the statutory method, under which goodwill is calculated as the difference between cost and fair value on the date that Vitafoam Canada became a subsidiary undertaking.
The statutory method would not give a true and fair view because it would result in the Groups share of Vitafoam Canada retained reserves, during the period that it was an associate, being re-characterised as goodwill.
Details of principal subsidiaries and associates are given on pages 58 and 59.

Annual Report 2004 51 Notes to the Accounts continued 20 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued B Currency exposures As explained on page 13 of the Operating and Financial Review, the Groups objectives in managing its structural currency exposures arising from its net investment overseas are to maintain a low cost of borrowing whilst partially hedging against currency movement.
Gains and losses arising from these structural currency exposures are recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
The Group does not hedge directly the translation exposure of the profit and loss account.
The table below shows the Groups transactional currency exposures: i. e. those exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the profit and loss account.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the operating currency of the operating unit involved, other than certain non-Sterling borrowings and forward foreign exchange contracts treated as hedges of net investment in overseas operations.
As at 31 December 2004 these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities m m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling Euro US Dollar Other Total Sterling - 0.4 0.1 0.3 0.8 Euro 0.1 - 0.4 - 0.3 Other 0.2 0.9 0.5 0.1 0.5 Total 0.3 0.5 1.0 0.4 0.6 The exposures at 31 December 2003 for comparison purposes were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities m m m m m Functional currency of Group operation Sterling Euro US Dollar Other Total Sterling -1.00.50.21.7 Euro - - - 0.1 0.1 Other 0.10.30.3-0.7 Total 0.11.30.80.32.5 The amounts shown in the tables above take into account the effect of forward foreign exchange contracts arranged to manage currency exposures.
C Borrowing facilities The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at 31 December, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, as follows: 2004 2003 m m Expiring in one year or less 7.5 14.0 Expiring in more than one year but not more than two years 7.2 - Expiring in more than two years but not more than five years 120.6 119.0 135.3 133.0 D Fair values The vast majority of Group debt is at floating rates, which are reset to market rates at frequent intervals.
The fair values of financial instruments were not materially greater or lower than the carrying value.
E Gains and losses on hedges Foreign currency transaction exposures are dealt with by the Corporate Treasury using forward foreign exchange contracts.
The market value of the Groups forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2004 showed a small unrealised loss and 31 December 2003 a small gain.
