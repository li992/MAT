Under UK GAAP, substantially all such impaired goodwill had been amortised or included in the write-off against share owners funds as of 1 January 1998, as more fully described in the note on accounting policies in the financial statements.

These differences relate principally to the following items: Corporate Brand Names.

allocated on the basis of fair values to the various net assets, including intangible xed assets, at the dates of acquisition and any net balance is treated as goodwill.
For goodwill, SFAS 142 prescribes a two-step impairment test: GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 January 1998 was fully written off against share owners funds, in accordance with the then preferred treatment under UK GAAP.
The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.

There are no differences in the performance as an intangible asset.
For certain acquisitions, where the directors consider it more appropriate, goodwill is amortised over its useful life, up to a 20-year period from the date of this step between UK GAAP and US GAAP, other than the amounts tested may differ due to GAAP differences affecting the carrying amounts of goodwill.
The remaining goodwill and intangible assets of the Group are considered to have an indefinite economic life for the reasons described in the note on accounting If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test, used to measure the amount of impairment loss, compares the policies in the financial statements.

The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner that the amount of Under US GAAP, goodwill is accounted for under SFAS 142 Goodwill and other Intangible Assets.
SFAS 142 directs that goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite goodwill recognised in a business combination is determined.
That is, the Group allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any useful life will not be amortised but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment.
Intangible assets that have nite lives will be amortised over their useful lives.
Therefore, previously unrecognised intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the amortisation of intangibles adjustment represents amortisation of intangible assets that have nite lives.
The excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill.

Under UK GAAP, the impairment test is only a one step test, in accordance with FRS 11.
This could give rise to a GAAP difference related to the impairment of goodwill.
Impairment The Groups indefinite lived intangible assets consist of goodwill and corporate brand Business combinations names.
The carrying value of these assets is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.
Under UK GAAP, the Group carries corporate brand names as intangible xed assets in the balance sheet.
The initial recognition of the JWT corporate brand was booked as a Under UK GAAP, an impairment charge is required for both goodwill and other indefinite revaluation in the year following acquisition and is not recognised under US GAAP.

The term recoverable amount as used in UK GAAP has the same meaning as fair value under Group, Inc and Young & Rubicam Inc, respectively, were booked as acquisition adjustments to balance sheet assets acquired.
These corporate brand names have been US GAAP, with fair value usually determined as the present value of future cash ows.
Impairment charges recorded under UK GAAP amounted to 36.0 million, 79.0 million determined to have an indefinite useful life based on their institutional nature, their proven ability to maintain market leadership and profitable operations over long periods of time and 145.7 million respectively, in 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on acquisitions is calculated at the historical exchange rate when each transaction is initially accounted for, and is therefore not retranslated at the period end.
Under US GAAP, goodwill is retranslated at the end of each period presented, resulting in foreign exchange loss of 243.2 million in 2004 2003: loss of 336.5 million, 2002: loss of 408.6 million being recognised in share owners funds.

The differences in accounting policy are primarily due to differing treatment of actuarial gains and losses which arise over the accounting period as a result of investment returns and demographic assumptions differing from those previously assumed, and also the effect of changing actuarial assumptions.
Under FRS 17, these actuarial gains and losses are immediately recognised in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses STRGL, whereas under SFAS 87 the actuarial gains and losses that at the beginning of the year exceed 10% of the greater of the value of the assets and the projected benefit obligation, are amortised over the future working lifetime of the scheme members.
Similarly, any related deferred tax effect recognised in the STRGL under UK GAAP is reversed under US GAAP.
In 2004, deferred taxes recognised in the STRGL amounted to 3.3 million 2003: 10.0 million: 2002: nil.
FRS 17 also requires the cost of prior service costs to be expensed over the period in which the benefit vests, whereas SFAS 87 provides for these costs to be amortised over 1 significant differences between UK and US accounting principles the future service periods of those employees active at the date of the amendment who continued are expected to receive benets under the plan.

Prior to the adoption of FIN 46R, VIEs were generally consolidated by companies owning a majority voting interest in the VIE.
The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R applied immediately to VIEs created after 31 January 2003, however, the FASB deferred the effective date for VIEs created before 1 February 2003 to the first reporting period ended after 15 March 2004.
Adoption of the provisions of FIN 46R prior to the deferred effective date was permitted.
The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the Group.
ii To be adopted in future periods EITF 03-01 In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue 03-01, The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments EITF 03-01.
EITF 03-01 is applicable to a debt and equity securities within the scope of SFAS 115, b debt and equity securities within the scope of SFAS 124 and that are held by an investor that reports a performance indicator, and c equity securities not within the scope of SFAS 115 and not accounted for under APB 18s equity method e. g. investments in private companies.
EITF 03-01 provides a step model to determine whether an investment is impaired and if impairment is other-than-temporary.
In addition, it requires that investors provide certain disclosures for cost method investments and, if applicable, other information related specically to cost method investments, such as the aggregate carrying amount of cost method investments, the aggregate amount of cost method investments that the investor did not evaluate for impairment because an impairment indicator was not present, and the situations under which the fair value of a cost method investment is not estimated.
The disclosures related to cost method investments should not be aggregated with other types of investments.
The effective date for the prospective application of the EITF 03-01 impairment model to all current and future investments has been delayed by FASB Staff Position EITF 03-01-01.
The required disclosures have been included in our financial statements.
SFAS 123R In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 revised 2004, Share-Based Payment SFAS 123R.
SFAS 123R replaces SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25.
SFAS 123R requires that the cost resulting from all share-based payment transactions be recognised in the financial statements at fair value and that excess tax benets be reported as a nancing cash inow rather than as a reduction of taxes paid.
SFAS 123R is effective for the Group from 1 January 2006.
SFAS 123R requires public companies to account for share-based payments using the modied-prospective method and permits public companies to also account for share-based payments using the modied-retrospective method.
Under the modied-prospective method, from the effective date, compensation cost is recognised based on the requirements of SFAS 123R for all new share-based awards and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123R that remain unvested on the effective date.
The modied-retrospective method permits companies to restate, based on the amounts previously recognised under SFAS 123 for pro forma disclosure purposes, either all prior periods presented or prior interim periods in the year of adoption.
The SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures given above show the impact of the Group adopting SFAS 123R in prior periods.
The Group has yet to determine whether it will adopt the modiedretrospective method.
SFAS 153 In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets.
SFAS 153 amends APB Opinion 29 replacing the exception from having to apply the fair value accounting provisions of APB 29 for nonmonetary exchanges of similar productive assets with a general exception for exchanges of nonmonetary assets that do not have commercial substance.
SFAS 153 is effective for the first reporting period beginning after 15 June 2005.
We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 153 will have a material impact on the Groups consolidated results of operations or financial position.
