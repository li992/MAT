uk Notes to the accounts continued 8 Pensions The required disclosures under FRS17: Retirement Benefits are included in note 27.
The following disclosures are based on the accounting rules under SSAP24: Accounting for pension costs.
The Bovis Homes Pension Scheme is an occupational defined benefit pension scheme providing benefits based on employees length of service and final average earnings.
The assets of the Scheme are held in a trust separately from the Company.
An actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out by an independent actuary at 30 June 2004 using the projected unit method.
The assets were taken into account at their market value.
The assumptions used to value the Schemes liabilities were as follows: 2004 valuation assumptions % per annum Discount rate - for past service 6.5 - for future service 6.5 Rate of increase in earnings 4.25 Rate of increase in pensions - for service to 5 April 1997 2.5 - for service from 6 April 1997 2.75 Rate of price inflation 2.8 At the date of the valuation the total market value of the assets of the Scheme was 34.85 million and this was sufficient to cover 77% of the benefits that had accrued to members at that date, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
Based on the valuation as at 30 June 2001, the pension cost was assessed to be 20% of pensionable earnings less 1.5 times the lower earnings limit where appropriate for the period 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2004.
Following the valuation as at 30 June 2004, the pension cost increased to 22% of pensionable earnings less 1.5 times the lower earnings limit where appropriate.
In addition, based upon the assessed past service deficit as at 30 June 2004 of 10.23 million, a further SSAP24 pension charge arises of 1.5 million per annum, including accrued interest to the scheduled settlement date.
In 2004, a past service deficit pension charge was made for the period 1 July 2004 to 31 December 2004 of 750,000.
During 2004, the Group paid contributions equal to 3,765,249 2003: 2,199,692 which arose from contributions of 20% of pensionable earnings less 1.5 times the lower earnings limit where appropriate for the period 1 January 2004 to 30 June 2004 and 22% of pensionable earnings less 1.5 times the lower earnings limit where appropriate for the period from 1 July 2004 to 31 December 2004 plus a special contribution of 1,850,000.
As a result there was a pension prepayment in the balance sheet of 1,100,000 as at 31 December 2004 2003: nil.
The Bovis Homes Group Personal Pension Plan is a defined contribution scheme established on 1 January 2002 for new employees joining the Group.
Other pension costs in relation to weekly paid employees totalled 13,125 2003: 12,561.

Diluted earnings per ordinary share is calculated on profit after tax of 101,982,000 2003: 86,513,000 over the diluted weighted average of 118,125,595 2003: 117,267,429 ordinary shares potentially in issue during the year.
The diluted average number of shares is calculated in accordance with FRS 14: Earnings Per Share.
The dilutive effect relates to the average number of potential ordinary shares held under option during the year.
This dilutive effect amounts to the number of ordinary shares which would be purchased using the aggregate difference in value between the market value of shares and the share option exercise price.
The market value of shares has been calculated using the average ordinary share price during the year.
Only share options which have met their cumulative performance criteria as at the year end have been included in the dilution calculation.
There is no dilutive effect on the profit after tax used in the diluted earnings per share calculation.
The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held in employee share trusts.

uk Notes to the accounts continued 18 Financial instruments The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources, bank loans and overdrafts, and various items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Groups operations.
Short term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the financial instrument disclosures.
Throughout the period under review, the Groups policy has been that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Group has no exposure to currency risk as all its financial assets and liabilities are denominated in sterling.
The Group has various bilateral committed revolving loan facilities.
At 31 December 2004 these facilities totalled 211 million with seven banks.
These facilities were split into five tranches: Facility Set up date Maturity date 35 million 11 December 2000 10 December 2005 20 million 11 December 2000 10 December 2007 124 million 10 January 2002 9 January 2007 20 million 6 February 2002 5 February 2007 12 million 3 May 2002 2 May 2007 At 31 December 2004, 136 million of these facilities remained undrawn.
The facilities scheduled to mature on 10 December 2005 and 10 December 2007 were fully drawn.
Of the facility scheduled to mature on 9 January 2007, 20 million was drawn.
In February 2005, the Group refinanced the bank facilities of 211 million, putting in place new five year bilateral revolving loan facilities for 220 million with six banks.
These facilities mature on 6 February 2010 and enjoy margins lower than the facilities which they replace.
All bar 7 million of the 211 million of existing facilities was cancelled as part of the refinancing, the remaining 7 million being part of a drawdown which matures on 13 June 2005 with a bank that is not part of the group of banks involved in the refinance.
On maturity of this 7 million drawdown it is intended this facility will be cancelled.
Financial assets and liabilities of the Group at 31 December 2004 comprised: 2004 2003 000 000 Cash balances 3,392 5 Short term deposits 56,094 30,000 Bank overdraft and bank loans repayable within one year 35,000 279 Bank loans repayable after more than one year 40,000 75,000 Other debtors falling due after more than one year 5,414 5,577 Other creditors due after more than one year 23,800 20,703 The interest rate profile of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 was as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 Floating rate - 279 Fixed rate 75,000 75,000 No interest 23,800 20,703 98,800 95,982 Bovis Homes Group PLC Page 83 Notes to the accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets at 31 December 2004 was as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 Floating rate 59,486 5 Fixed rate - 30,000 No interest 5,414 5,577 64,900 35,582 The maturity of the Groups financial liabilities at 31 December 2004 can be analysed as follows: 2004 2003 000 000 One year or less, or on demand 35,000 279 More than one year but not more than two years 12,751 43,893 More than two years but not more than five years 51,049 51,810 98,800 95,982 The floating rate bank overdraft is subject to interest rates related to bank base rate and is repayable on demand.
The floating rate financial assets relate to cash held in interest bearing accounts.
The fixed rate financial assets relate to cash placed on the money market which earns interest based on interest rates set by contract and have short term fixed periods to maturity.
At 31 December 2004 the Group held borrowings of 75 million.
Of these borrowings 40 million, although repayable at dates in 2005 were drawn down through bilateral committed revolving loan facilities which mature at dates after 31 December 2005.
The borrowings are capable of being refinanced under these facilities and are therefore disclosed as liabilities due after more than one year.
The balance of 35 million was drawn down through a bilateral committed revolving loan facility which matures on 10 December 2005.
Of the 75 million of borrowings, 35 million is repayable on 13 June 2005 and attracts a fixed rate of interest of 6.57% per annum, 20 million is repayable on 13 June 2005 and attracts a fixed rate of 6.70% per annum and 20 million is repayable on 12 January 2005 and attracts a fixed rate of interest of 6.09% per annum.
All of these loans have interest rates which are based on floating interest rates prevailing at the dates of drawing down, however, the rates of interest are fixed through interest rate swap arrangements.
The interest rate swap arrangements which fix the interest rates payable on 55 million of the Groups borrowings were established on 11 December 2000, 35 million fixed for a five year period and 20 million fixed for a seven year period.
The swap arrangements are recalculated on a semi annual basis to fix the interest rates at 6.57% and 6.70% respectively.
The interest rate swap arrangements which fix the interest rates payable on the remaining 20 million of the Groups borrowings were established on 10 January 2002 for a five year period.
These swap arrangements are calculated on a semi annual basis to fix the interest rate at 6.09%.
The weighted average interest rate applying to borrowings as at 31 December 2004 was 6.48% 2003: 6.48% and the weighted average maturity period of borrowings was 1.8 years 2003: 2.8 years.
The Group has not entered into derivative transactions other than the interest rate swap arrangements.
Other debtors and other creditors due after more than one year are not subject to interest.
Other than the Groups borrowings, amounts due after one year relate almost exclusively to sums due on land purchase contracts.
These sums are generally due for payment based upon details included within the land purchase contract and their maturity is therefore certain.
The fair value of land creditors due after more than one year amounted to 20.4 million 2003: 17.5 million compared with their carrying value of 23.2 million 2003: 20.1 million.
The fair value was derived from the discounting of future cash flows from the estimated settlement dates of land creditors.
Page 84 Bovis Homes Group PLC www.
uk Notes to the accounts continued 18 Financial instruments continued The fair value of the Groups fixed rate borrowings, fixed by interest swap arrangements amounted to 76.3 million 2003: 77.2 million compared with their carrying value of 75.0 million 2003: 75.0 million.
The excess of the fair value over book value reflected the cost of borrowing prevailing at 31 December 2004 as against the fixed rate of borrowings arising from the swap arrangements.
The fair value differences of the long term financial liabilities are not required to be accounted for within the profit and loss account.
The differences as disclosed will reverse as these liabilities near their maturity.
There were no material differences between the book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets due after more than one year.
The fair value was calculated by discounting expected cash flows arising on such financial assets.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme, options are granted on a discretionary basis relative to executives seniority within the Group.
The options can be exercised if the auditors have certified that the cumulative increase in annualised earnings per share exceeds the percentage increase in the RPI by at least 4% per annum 2% per annum for share options granted before 2001 over three consecutive financial years.
Assuming this condition is satisfied options may, under normal circumstances, be exercised between the third and tenth anniversary from the dates of grant shown above.
As at 11 March 2005 options granted on 8 December 1997, 2 April 1998, 17 March 1999, 17 September 1999, 16 March 2000, 19 March 2001 and 19 April 2001 have satisfied the condition.
The rules of the Save As You Earn Share Option Scheme specify that, under normal circumstances, options may be exercised after three, five years or seven years depending on which savings contract is chosen by the employee.
The option period then extends for six months from the appropriate date.
The Group has employed the exemption under The Urgent Issues Task Force Abstract 17 Employee share schemes from charging the discount on Save As You Earn options to the profit and loss account.
Details of share options held by directors are included in the Report on directors remuneration on pages 55 to 66.
