Notes to the financial statements Accounting policies The Group financial statements are prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards.
A summary of the more important Group accounting policies is given below.
Accounting policies have been applied consistently with previous years except as noted below.
During the year the Group has implemented Urgent Issues Task Force UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and UITF 17, as amended Employee Share Schemes.
Investments in own shares which were previously disclosed in fixed assets investments are now shown as a reduction to shareholders funds.
Under UITF 38, the exceptional impairment made against the carrying value of own shares in the year ended 31 March 2003 has been reversed.
UITF 17, as amended, requires the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of award and any consideration paid for the shares to be charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period of each scheme.
The charge to the profit and loss account was previously based on the difference between the original cost of the shares and any consideration paid for the shares.
The SAYE schemes options are now included in the option charge.
The Group had previously treated the SAYE schemes as exempt as allowed under UITF 17, as amended.
The 2003 accounts have been restated to reflect the adoption of UITF 38 and UITF 17, as amended.
The impact of these changes on the profit and loss account and reserves is described in Note 12.
The Directors have reviewed the appropriateness of the Groups accounting policies in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard FRS 18 and considered the impact of the introduction of FRS 5 application Note G. The contract accounting policy has been refined to accommodate the complexity and length of the contracts being entered into.
Under the transitional rules of FRS 17, the Group has made certain disclosures in relation to the balance sheet and performance statements which are presented in Note 29.
Basis of accounting The Financial Statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the valuation of current asset investments as set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings.
The results of the subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the profit and loss account from the date of acquisition.
The accounts of the Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs are incorporated into the results of the Group as, although they are administered by independent Trustees and their assets are held separately from the Group, in practice the Groups advice on how the assets are used for the benefit of employees is normally accepted.
The Group bears the major risks and rewards of the assets held by the EBTs until the shares vest unconditionally in the employees.
In accordance with UITF 38 shares in WS Atkins plc held by the EBTs are shown as a reduction in shareholders funds.
Other assets and liabilities held by the EBTs are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, no profit and loss account is presented for the parent company.
Goodwill Goodwill is stated at cost less a provision for amortisation.
Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over its expected useful life.
The useful life is not normally expected to exceed 20 years.
Provision is made for impairment.
Joint Ventures In accordance with FRS 9 Associates and Joint Ventures, the Group accounts for Joint Ventures under the gross equity method of accounting.
The results of holdings in Joint Ventures are included from the date on which the Group acquires joint control.
Where there is sufficient evidence that an event has irrevocably changed the relationship between the Group and the Joint Venture such that the Groups ability to exercise significant influence is removed, the carrying amount at the date of the event is reported as an investment and no account is taken of subsequent changes in the ventures assets and liabilities.
The results, assets and liabilities of Joint Ventures are stated in accordance with Group accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures do not adopt Group accounting policies, their reported results are restated to comply with Group accounting policies.
Where Joint Ventures do not adopt accounting periods that are co-terminus with the Groups results, results and net assets are based upon accounts drawn up to the Groups accounting reference date.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2004 48 Turnover Group turnover from long-term contracts comprises the value of work performed during the year by reference to total sales value and stage of completion of these contracts.
Turnover from other contract activities represents fee income receivable in respect of services provided during the year.
Under certain services contracts, the Group manages customer expenditure and is obliged to purchase goods and services from third party contractors and recharge them on to the customer at cost.
The amounts charged by contractors and recharged to customers are excluded from turnover and cost of sales.
Debtors, creditors and cash relating to these transactions are included in the Group balance sheet.
Contract accounting The value of contract work in progress comprises the costs incurred on contracts plus an appropriate proportion of overheads and attributable profit.
Profit is recognised on a percentage completion basis when the outcome of a contract or project can be reasonably forseen.
Provision is made in full for estimated losses.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be reasonably foreseen, profit is taken on completion.
Where contracts span two accounting periods profit is not recognised until the contract is 50% complete.
Where contracts span more than two accounting periods profit is recognised in each period to reflect the obligations completed in the period, provided that the outcome of the contract can be reasonably foreseen.
Fees invoiced on account are deducted from the value of work in progress and the balance is separately disclosed in debtors as amounts recoverable on contracts, unless such fees exceed the value of the work in progress on any contract when the excess is separately disclosed in current liabilities as fees invoiced in advance.
Income recognition on outsourcing contracts is determined based on the proportion of the annual service delivered to date.
Where the costs of obligations in relation to the non-renewal or termination of a contract are higher in the final year of the contract a proportion of revenue is deferred each year to meet these anticipated costs.
Full provision is made for losses on outsourcing contracts if the forecast costs of fulfilling the contract throughout the contract period exceed the forecast income receivable.
In assessing the amount of the loss to provide on an outsourcing contract, account is taken of the Groups share of the forecast results from Joint Ventures which the contract is servicing.
Stocks are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Pre-contract costs relating to PFI PPP investments which involve Special Purpose Companies The Group accounts for all pre-contract costs in accordance with UITF 34 Pre-contract costs.
Costs incurred before it is virtually certain that a contract will be obtained are charged to expenses.
Directly attributable costs incurred after that point are recognised in the balance sheet and charged to the profit and loss account over the same period as the Groups interest in any Special Purpose Company SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the profit and loss account.
Bid recovery fees are deferred and credited to the profit and loss account over the same period as the Groups interest in any SPC charges the equivalent capitalised amounts to the profit and loss account.
Where the Groups interest in an SPC reduces, the deferred bid recovery fees are credited to the profit and loss account in proportion to the reduction of the Groups interest.
Depreciation and amortisation Tangible and intangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight line basis calculated at annual rates to write off each asset over the term of its useful life as follows: Goodwill 10 to 20 years Freehold buildings 10 to 50 years Short leasehold over the life of the lease Plant and machinery 3 to 10 years Special purpose industrial motor vehicles 3 to 12 years Other motor vehicles 3 to 4 years Information Technology 3 to 5 years Corporate Information Systems 7 years No depreciation is provided in respect of freehold land.
The Directors annually review the estimated useful lives of the fixed assets.
Costs included in Corporate Information Systems are those directly attributable to design, construction and testing of new systems including major enhancements from the point of inception to the point of satisfactory completion.
Costs include costs of own labour.
Maintenance and minor modifications are expensed to profit and loss as incurred.
WS Atkins plc Annual Report 2004 49 Notes to the financial statements continued Share Scheme Reserve and costs of options The Share Scheme Reserve represents the investment in own shares which are held by the EBTs primarily to satisfy the Groups liabilities to employees for share options and other long-term incentive plans.
In accordance with UITF 17, as amended, the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of the award and any consideration paid for the shares is charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period of each scheme.
Any cumulative charge relating to options which have lapsed in the year is reversed in the year of lapse.
The charge is applied to all share option schemes including SAYE schemes.
Current asset investments Current asset investments include UK Government securities, short-term deposits and restricted cash deposits, which are shown at market value.
Restricted cash deposits relate to accounts where withdrawals are restricted under contractual agreements.
Lease obligations On the inception of finance leases, the asset is capitalised and a liability recognised for the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets are depreciated over the remaining contract term.
Rentals are apportioned between capital and interest expense to achieve a constant rate of charge on the outstanding obligation.
The costs of operating leases are charged to profit and loss account as incurred.
Where the Group acts as a lessor in an arrangement which transfers substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to a third party, that lease is treated as a finance lease.
All other lease arrangements are treated as operating leases.
Debtors under finance leases represent outstanding amounts due under these agreements less finance charges allocated to future periods.
Finance lease interest is recognised over the primary period of the lease so as to produce a constant rate of return on the net cash investment.
Rental income from operating leases is accounted for on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pension schemes Contributions to funded defined benefit pension schemes are calculated as a percentage, agreed on independent actuarial advice, of the pensionable salaries of employees.
The cost of providing pensions and any variations from the regular cost, arising from actuarial valuations, is charged or credited to the profit and loss account on a systematic basis over the expected average remaining service lives of the members of each scheme.
The pension cost is assessed in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries.
The difference between the charge for pensions and the total contributions actually paid is included within provisions for liabilities and charges.
The pension costs relating to the defined contribution schemes represent contributions payable by the Group.
Deferred taxation Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where the transactions or events that give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet date.
A net deferred tax asset is recognised only when it can be regarded as more likely than not that it will be recovered.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis using tax rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency transactions and financial instruments Forward foreign exchange contracts entered into as hedges of future purchases and sales denominated in foreign currency are recorded at cost and are then revalued to market rates at each balance sheet date.
Gains and losses are deferred and taken to profit and loss to match the maturity of the underlying transactions.
Gains and losses on those contracts which are no longer designated as hedges are taken to the profit and loss account as they arise.
Foreign currency debtors covered by forward currency contracts are translated at the contract rates of exchange: other foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated at closing rates of exchange.
Gains and losses are taken to the profit and loss account, except that exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings to finance foreign currency net investments are taken to reserves.
Trading results of overseas subsidiaries are translated at average rates of exchange.
Differences resulting from the retranslation of opening net assets and results for the year at closing rates are taken to the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
US Dollar borrowings are used to hedge against the Group investment in the USA.
The net exchange differences are taken to reserves.
Forward foreign exchange contracts are carried on the balance sheet at fair value marked to market with changes in the value recognised in the profit and loss account for the period.
Warrants Warrants are held within shareholders funds at the fair value of the consideration received at the date of issue.
The fair value is deemed to be the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the prevailing market value of the shares at the date of issuing the warrants.
Where warrants are issued as consideration for the cost of a debt instrument the fair value of the warrant is charged to the profit and loss account on a weighted average basis over the life of the debt instrument.
Warrants that lapse unexercised are credited back to the profit and loss account reserve.

The 30-year contract is broken down 1 into four 7 2 year periods.

Joint Ventures continued 4. f Metronet Financial Close On 4 April 2003, Financial Close was reached on the 30-year Metronet London Underground PPP in which the Group is a 20% equal partner.
At Financial Close, Atkins received 20.1m in respect of bid cost recoveries and project development fees from Metronet.
In line with the Groups accounting policy in relation to pre-contract costs incurred on PFI PPP investments, this sum was recognised on the balance sheet and will be released to the profit and loss account over 30 years.
Atkins will invest 70m in Metronet by way of equity and shareholder subordinated debt over the first six years of the concession.
During the year ended 31 March 2004, the Group invested 10.4m.
Atkins has obtained standby Letters of Credit from its bankers to support the deferred element of its commitment.
The fees for the standby Letters of Credit included an agreement to issue warrants in respect of 4,715,200 shares which represented 4.73% of Atkins issued share capital at the time, all of which were exercised during the year to 31 March 2004.
The cost of these warrants was 6.9m, representing the difference between the market price of the shares at Financial Close, 145p per share, and the amount payable on exercise of the warrants, being the nominal value of the shares issued of 0.5p per share.
This amount will be charged to the profit and loss account on a weighted average basis over the life of the standby Letters of Credit.
The contract The Metronet PPP companies have two separate 30-year performance-based contracts which together cover over two thirds 1 of the London Underground network.
The contracts, which are split into four 7 2 year periods, cover inter alia the repairs, refurbishment and modernisation of the infrastructure.
The contracts are subject to Periodic Review at the end of each 1 7 2 year period.
The Periodic Reviews allow for restating the scope of work, the level of payment, the contractual terms and the performance requirements.
The Metronet PPP companies have contracted with Trans4m Ltd, a Joint Venture company in which Atkins has a 25% 1 shareholding, to undertake the civil engineering work and the refurbishment programme.
Trans4m Ltd has signed a 7 2 year contract with Atkins for premises and civil design, inspection and assessment work and the design and build of new communication systems.
The Metronet PPP companies revenues consist of a fixed element Underlying Infrastructure Service Charge which is adjusted for performance.
Performance is measured under three categories: capability, availability and ambience.
Shareholder returns are sensitive to these performance-based measures.
Consolidation of Metronets results In line with the Groups accounting policies on Joint Ventures, the results of Metronet have been accounted for under the gross equity method of accounting.
As part of its consolidation of the Metronet PPP companies balance sheets, Atkins has recognised 8.7m of goodwill associated with liabilities inherited when the PPP companies were acquired from London Underground Limited.
This will be amortised over 20 years.
Metronets accounting policies The Directors have reviewed Metronets accounting policies for their compatibility with that of the Group and, more specifically, Metronets policies on revenue recognition and interest capitalisation.
In line with FRS 5 Application Note G, Metronet recognises revenue on the fulfillment of its contractual obligations.
Metronet also capitalises interest costs associated with certain aspects of its capital projects programme.
The Directors consider that Metronets accounting policy on revenue recognition is compatible with the Groups policy and that interest capitalisation for Metronet is appropriate.
Consequently no adjustments have been made on consolidation.

Profits of the Holding Company The holding company has not presented its own profit and loss account as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The retained profit for the year was 15.9m 2003: 3.0m loss.
Earnings loss per share Basic earnings per share are calculated in accordance with FRS 14 Earnings per share, by dividing profit after tax of 37.4m 2003 restated: loss of 38.0m by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the period of 96,473,370 2003: 92,486,187, excluding 5,498,429 shares held by the Employee Benefit Trusts EBTs which have not unconditionally vested in the employees.
Fully diluted earnings per share is the Basic earnings per share after allowing for the dilutive effect of the conversion into ordinary shares of the number of options outstanding during the period.
The number of shares used for the Fully Diluted calculation is 97,668,548 2003: 93,048,051.
The options relate to the SAYE schemes, Equity Participation Plans and Long Term Incentive Plans.
In accordance with FRS 14, there is deemed to be no diluting effect of potential ordinary shares where there is a basic loss per share.
The adjusted earnings per share information has been calculated based on an Adjusted profit after tax of 38.5m 2003: 15.2m.
Adjusted profit is before Metronet bid costs, amortisation of pension fund deficit surplus, amortisation of goodwill, exceptional items, Colchester Garrison dilution gain and Employee Benefit Trusts.
The Board believes that this additional measure provides a better indicator of the underlying trends in the business.

Changes to accounting policies The UITF abstracts 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts and 17, as amended, Employee Share Schemes have been adopted in the current year.
The 2003 comparatives have been restated.
UITF 38 requires that investments in own shares which were previously disclosed in Fixed Asset Investments are shown as a reduction to shareholders funds.
UITF 17, as amended, requires the difference between market value of the shares at the date of award and any consideration paid for the shares to be charged to the profit and loss account over the performance period of each scheme.
The Group now charges the cost of SAYE options to profit and loss.
Previously the Group had taken advantage of the exemption allowed in UITF 17, as amended, and not applied the exemption to SAYE schemes.
Operating profit has been reduced by 1.3m 2003: increase in operating loss 0.1m resulting from the changes in the basis of calculating the charges to profit and loss account and the timing of their recognition.
The impairment provision made against investment in own shares has been reversed as a consequence of the adoption of UITF 38 and is included in the 16.3m adjustment to the profit before tax in 2003.
Other investments and reserves have been reduced by 14.7m 2003 : 29.0m as a result of the changes and the need to deduct the cost of own shares held to satisfy employee share based benefits, from reserves.
A realised gain of 5.8m has been reported in the Statement of total recognised gains and losses.
This is the net effect of reversing the cumulative UITF 17 charge of 20.3m, which includes the impairment charge from the prior year, and including the revised UITF 17 as amended by UITF 38 charge of 14.5m.

Fair values The fair value of the assets and liabilities of the Group, with the exception of the forward currency contracts, are considered to be materially equivalent to their book value.
The fair values of these assets and liabilities have been determined by discounting future cashflows of the relevant financial instrument at the Groups incremental borrowing rate.

Pension schemes 29. a SSAP 24 Pensions The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, which are mainly in the United Kingdom.
Membership of the Groups principal pension schemes is as follows: Defined Benefit Schemes Defined Contribution Schemes Atkins Staff Scheme Railways Scheme Atkins Staff Scheme F&G 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 No.
The latest full actuarial valuation of the defined benefits section of the Atkins Staff Scheme was at 1 April 2001.
However an interim actuarial assessment was undertaken by an independent actuary as at 30 September 2003 the results of which have been used to evaluate the 2004 SSAP 24 pension charge.
The main assumptions used for the September 2003 SSAP 24 assessment are listed in the table below with 2001 valuation assumptions as comparatives.
2003 2001 Rate of Inflation 2.50% 3.00% Real pension increases: Fixed 2.40% 2.00% Limited price indexation 0% 0% Real salary increases 1.50% 1.50% Real investment return: Future service 4.00% 4.25% Past service 4.25% 3.50% Under SSAP 24 assumptions the total market value of the assets at the date of the 2001 Valuation was 374.5m and the actuarial value of the assets was sufficient to cover approximately 105% of the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
The market value of the assets at the date of the September interim assessment was 370.0m, and the approximate past service shortfall was 65.0m, equivalent to a past service funding level of 85%.
For the purposes of SSAP 24 the shortfall is being amortised as a level percentage of salary over the estimated service lives of current employees in the scheme through to 2019.
As the scheme is now closed to new entrants the current service costs, under the projected unit valuation method, will increase as a percentage of salary as members of the scheme approach retirement, although the overall cost of the scheme will decrease as the number of members decreases.
The most recent triennial full valuation of the Railways Pension Scheme took place at 31 December 2001.
Based on the 2001 SSAP 24 assumptions in the above table, the total market value of the assets at the date of the valuation was sufficient to cover approximately 128% of the benefits that had accrued to members allowing for assumed future increase in salaries.
The actuarial assessment undertaken at 30 September 2003 using the 2003 SSAP 24 assumptions noted above identified assets of 97.0m and an excess of assets over accrued liabilities surplus of 18.5m.
This surplus is being amortised as a level percentage of salary over the estimated service lives of current employees in the Scheme through to 2016.
In addition there is a pension prepayment, representing the excess of the amount funded over the accumulated pension cost, of 2.5m 2003: 2.6m.
This has been netted with the pension provisions of the other defined benefit schemes and included in provisions for liabilities and charges.
Other pension schemes include the Atkins McCarthy Pension scheme in Eire closed to new entrants and a range of defined contribution schemes or equivalent in a number of other overseas subsidiaries.

With effect from April 2004 the Group will pay an additional 3.5m per annum and employee contributions will be increased.
Employee contribution rates will be further increased in April 2005.
The combination of the additional staff contributions and the 3.5m per annum company contribution is estimated to eliminate the past service shortfall over a period of 15 years.
Employer contributions will be subject to review following the full valuation being carried out as at 1 April 2004.
No additional funding is currently required by the Railways Scheme.
The next full triennial actuarial valuation is at 1 April 2004 for the Atkins Staff Scheme and at 1 January 2005 for the Railways Scheme.
A provision of 23.5m which incorporates the unfunded pension promise is included in provisions for liabilities and charges representing the excess of accumulated pension cost over the amount funded 2003: 17.9m.
The pension cost of the defined contribution schemes was 9.2m, an increase of 1.5m.
This is mainly the result of increased membership as the majority of new staff are offered membership of the defined contribution schemes following the closure of the defined benefits scheme to new entrants.
