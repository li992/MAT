The Companys balance sheet at that date, and relevant notes, have been restated for this change.

The reduction in the net internal debt reects, in part, the repayment by the corporate and holding entities of upstream loans and an increase in the tangible assets held by corporate entities arising from a combination of capital raising activities and dividends received from business operations.

b Longer term investment return i The longer term investment return, net of expenses, allocated to the general business technical account and transferred from the long-term business technical account was 1,085 million 2003: 1,039 million and 67 million 2003: 129 million, respectively.

In respect of equities and properties, the return is calculated by multiplying the opening market value of the investments, adjusted for sales and purchases during the year, by the longer term rate of investment return.
The longer term rate of investment return is determined using consistent assumptions between operations, having regard to local economic and market forecasts of investment return.
The allocated longer term return for other investments is the actual income receivable for the year.
iv The principal assumptions underlying the calculation of the longer-term investment return are: Longer term rates of return Longer term rates of return Equities Properties 2004 2003 2004 2003 %%%% UK 8.1% 8.1% 6.6% 6.6% France 7.5% 7.5% 6.5% 6.5% Ireland 8.7% 8.7% 6.7% 6.7% Netherlands 8.4% 8.4% 6.5% 6.5% Canada 9.3% 9.3% 7.3% 7.3% c The actual return on investments, before deducting investment management expenses and charges, is compared below with the aggregate longer term return over a five year period.

The sale was subject to obtaining regulatory clearance and approval from other shareholders in the Asian businesses.
Under the terms of the agreement, MSI will acquire all of Avivas general insurance businesses in Asia.
These comprise the general insurance business of Aviva Limited and the general insurance assets of Aviva Asia Pte Limited in Singapore: Aviva Insurance Berhad in Malaysia including its branch in Brunei : Aviva Insurance Thai Company Limited in Thailand: PT Aviva Insurance in Indonesia: Dah Sing General Insurance Company Limited in Hong Kong: and Avivas branch operations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Marianas, Macau and Taiwan.
The transaction will be achieved through share purchase of Avivas interests in joint venture operations, business purchase and asset purchase in Singapore, and transfer of Avivas general insurance branch operations in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Marianas, Macau and Taiwan.
87 Accounts and notes Aviva plc 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 16 Subsidiary undertakings continued The transaction was expected to complete in two phases.
Phase I completed on 28 February 2005 and included all businesses above except for Malaysia, Indonesia, Macau, Marianas, Taiwan, Dah Sing and the Philippines, which will be included as part of the completion of Phase II, expected in the second half of 2005.
Subject to the receipt of regulatory approval, the total proceeds for the sale of these businesses were xed by reference to the net assets of the businesses as at 31 December 2003 and are not adjusted to reect the results in the period from 1 January 2004 to completion.
The Group does not bear any continuing operating risk from 31 December 2003.
Financial Reporting Standard 2 Accounting for subsidiary undertakings requires the results of the Asian general insurance business to be consolidated with those of the Groups ongoing operations until the completion of the transaction.
Although the Group has retained no economic interest in the operations of this business beyond 31 December 2003, the post tax operating profits are incorporated in the Groups consolidated profit and loss account from 1 January 2004 to the date of completion.
This will be offset by a corresponding change to the profit on sale calculated at 31 December 2003.
Consequently, had the transaction been completed on 31 December 2004, the post tax profit on sale would have been 129 million and is summarised below: m US$m Net assets at 31 December 2003 60 108 Post tax operating profit to 31 December 2004 13 24 Net assets at 31 December 2004 73 132 Proceeds 250 450 Less: net assets 73 132 Less: transactions costs 8 14 Pre tax profit on sale 169 304 Tax attributable to profit on sale 40 72 Post tax profit on sale 129 232 The Group has hedged its exposure to the sale proceeds of US$450 million through the purchase of foreign currency forward contracts.
The operating profit before tax, amortisation of goodwill and exceptional items for the Asian general insurance businesses was 20 million, comprising 15 million underwriting profits and 5 million of long-term investment return.
ii In July 2004, the Group completed the disposal of its Your Move estate agency and e. surveying business.
Total consideration was 42 million and the net assets disposed of 12 million.
The loss on disposal was 141 million after deducting the associated cost of disposal and after writing back goodwill of 167 million, previously written off to reserves, as required by FRS10 Goodwill and intangible assets.
The same goodwill amount is also credited directly to the profit and loss account reserve and therefore has a neutral effect on shareholders funds.
d Exceptional costs for termination of operations In February 2004, the Group announced the closure of its UK national broker subsidiary, Hill House Hammond HHH by the end of 2004 together with the sale of its commercial business.
The associated pre-tax costs of the closure of HHH are 50 million and these exceptional costs relate to the redundancy costs and closure provisions.
During 2003, the Group incurred costs on the closure of its general insurance operations in Belgium.
These exceptional costs relate to termination activities, including redundancy costs and closure provisions.

The directors are satisfied that the aggregate value of all such investments is not less than the aggregate amount at which they are stated in the balance sheet.

One of the Groups subsidiaries, Delta Lloyd NV, is subject to the provisions of Dutch corporate law and particularly the Dutch structure company regime.
Under this regime, Delta Lloyd has appointed a Supervisory Board which has a duty to have regard to the interests of a wide variety of stakeholders.
The Supervisory Board includes two Aviva Group representatives and is responsible for advising and supervising Delta Lloyds Executive Board.
The shareholder is one of the most important stakeholders to whom the Supervisory Board has a duty.
The relationship between the Supervisory Board and its shareholder reects this and this strengthens the position of Delta Lloyd Group as a major part of the Aviva Group.
17 Goodwill The carrying value of goodwill on subsidiary undertakings relates to investments held by the non-long-term business operations and comprises the following: Positive Negative Total Total goodwill goodwill 2004 2003 m m m m Cost: At 1 January 1,553 53 1,500 1,342 Additions note 16b 144 144 140 Disposals 13 13 9 Foreign exchange rate movements 3 3 27 At 31 December 1,687 53 1,634 1,500 Amortisation: At 1 January 408 13 395 302 Charge in the year 107 3 104 88 Disposals 2 2 9 Foreign exchange rate movements 2 2 14 At 31 December 515 16 499 395 Carrying value at 31 December 1,172 37 1,135 1,105 Positive and negative goodwill is being amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life.
Useful economic lives have been determined in respect of each acquisition to match the period over which the value of the underlying businesses will exceed the value of their identiable net assets.
No useful economic lives are in excess of 20 years.
As explained in accounting policy K on page 65, goodwill arising in 1997 and prior years was eliminated directly against reserves.
The carrying value of land and buildings occupied by the Group for its own activities was 282 million 2003: 405 million.
The valuation of properties has been undertaken by qualied external valuers or by local qualied staff of the Group in overseas operations.
All properties are valued at open market value.
b In 2003, the Group commenced a review of its property requirements in the UK.
This review was completed in 2004, resulting in the following: i In June 2004, the Groups UK businesses entered into an agreement to dispose of certain core freehold and leasehold properties occupied for their own activities, and lease them back for periods up to 25 years.
The majority of these properties were previously in life funds, owned by the policyholders, which then leased them to the operating shareholder companies.
This new arrangement has not led to a material increase in the lease rentals payable.
The rental expense to the shareholder companies on these properties in 2004 was 13 million 2003: 14 million.
ii The review concluded that a number of properties were considered to be surplus to the Groups ongoing requirements and, as a result, would be disposed of.
A provision of 80 million is held for the cost of future rents, service charges and maintenance, less any expected rental income, during the period until expected disposal of the relevant properties.
c The Group had no other material operating lease commitments.
89 Accounts and notes Aviva plc 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 19 Investments in joint ventures a As part of their investment strategy, the UK long-term business policyholder funds have invested in a number of property limited partnerships PLPs, either directly or via property unit trusts PUTs, through a mix of capital and loans.
The PLPs are managed by general partners GPs, in which the UK long-term business shareholder companies hold equity stakes and which themselves hold nominal stakes in the PLPs.
The PUTs are managed by a group subsidiary.
Most of the PLPs have raised external debt, secured on their respective property portfolios.
The lenders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both interest and principal, to the extent that there are sufficient resources in the respective PLPs.
The lenders have no recourse whatsoever to the policyholder or shareholders funds of any company in the Aviva Group.
Accounting for the PUTs and PLPs as subsidiary undertakings, joint ventures or other financial investments depends on the shareholdings in the GPs and the terms of each partnership agreement.
Where the Group exerts control over a PLP, it has been treated as a subsidiary and its results, assets and liabilities have been consolidated.
Where the partnership is managed by a contractual agreement such that no one party exerts control, notwithstanding that the Groups partnership share in the PLP including its indirect stake via the relevant PUT and GP may be greater than 50%, such PUTs and PLPs have been accounted for as joint ventures, and are covered in this note.
Here, the Groups share of the respective PLPs gross assets and gross liabilities are shown on the face of the consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with the requirements of FRS9 Associates and joint ventures.
Where the Group holds minority stakes in PLPs, with no disproportionate inuence, the relevant investments are included in other financial investments at their market value.

DLL and AMS received interest of 1 million in 2004 2003: 2 million on the loan notes they hold in the securitisation companies.
They also receive fees from the securitisation companies for the administration of the loans and payments under the terms of interest rate swaps written between DLL, AMS and these companies to hedge their respective exposures to movements in interest rates arising from these transactions.
In each case, the effect of the swaps is that the securitisation companies convert all or part of the interest ows receivable from customers in respect of the securitised mortgage loans into xed interest ows which are designed substantially to match the interest payable to the noteholders.
Included in investment income is 29 million 2003: 25 million relating to these swaps.
c In all of the above transactions, the Company and its subsidiaries are not obliged to support any losses that may be suffered by the noteholders and do not intend to provide such support.
Additionally, the notes were issued on the basis that noteholders are only entitled to obtain payment, of both principal and interest, to the extent that the available resources of the respective special purpose securitisation companies, including funds due from customers in respect of the securitised loans, are sufficient and that noteholders have no recourse whatsoever to other companies in the Aviva Group.
Total mortgage assets and non-recourse funding in the above quasi-subsidiaries at 31 December 2004 were 5,021 million 2003: 3,149 million and 5,010 million 2003: 3,143 million respectively.
As permitted by FRS5 Reporting the substance of transactions, these balances are accounted for in the consolidated Group balance sheet using a linked presentation.
Interest receivable and payable on the above items in 2004 totalled 150 million 2003: 195 million and 111 million 2003: 166 million respectively.
Apart from the administration fees payable to other Group undertakings, described above, there are no other material profit and loss items in these companies.
The majority of the securitisations relate to long-term business.
Cash inows from non-recourse funding on non-long-term business were 1,437 million in 2004 2003: nil.

c From March 1998 to March 2003, it was the Companys practice to satisfy awards and options granted under the executive incentive plans through shares purchased in the market and held by employee share trusts which were established for this purpose and funded by the Company.
From March 2003, no shares have been purchased by the trusts, it being the Companys current practice to satisfy awards granted after that date by the issue of new shares at the time of vesting.
At 31 December 2004, 5,894,264 shares were held by the employee share trusts with an aggregate nominal value of 1.5 million and a market value of 37 million.
The trustees of the employee share trusts have waived their rights to dividends on the shares held in these trusts.
Further details are given in note 33 below.

This profit has been disclosed as being non-distributable in the Companys accounts since then.
After consideration of ICAEW guidance note 7 03 on the determination of realised profits and losses, the directors believe that this amount should more properly have remained within the Companys revaluation reserve and have authorised the above reserve transfer.
As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account of the Company has not been included in these accounts.

99 Accounts and notes Aviva plc 2004 Notes to the accounts continued 37 Long-term business a The Group underwrites long-term business in a number of countries as follows: i In the UK mainly in with-profit funds of CGNU Life Assurance, Commercial Union Life Assurance, Norwich Union Life & Pensions and the Provident Mutual fund, where the with-profits policyholders are entitled to at least 90% of the distributed profits, the shareholders receiving the balance: non-profit funds of Norwich Union Annuity, Norwich Union Life & Pensions and Norwich Union Linked Life Assurance, where shareholders are entitled to 100% of the distributed profits.
Shareholder profits on unitised with-profit business written by Norwich Union Life & Pensions and on stakeholder unitised with-profit business are derived from management fees and policy charges, and emerge in the non-profit funds.
ii In France, where the majority of policyholders benets are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
In addition, a substantial number of policies participate in investment returns, with the balance being attributable to shareholders.
iii In the Netherlands, where the balance of profits, after providing appropriate returns for policyholders, accrues for the benefit of the shareholders.
The bases for determining returns for policyholders are complex, but are consistent with methods and criteria followed generally in the Netherlands.
In addition, a substantial number of policies provide benets which are determined by investment performance, subject to certain guarantees, and shareholders profits are derived largely from management fees.
iv In other overseas operations, using methods similar to those described above.
b The directors have been advised by the Groups reporting actuary that the assets of each of the long-term operations were at least sufficient to meet their respective liabilities at 31 December 2004.
38 Long-term business provision a Methodology There are two main methods of actuarial valuation of liabilities arising under long-term insurance contracts the net premium method and the gross premium method both of which involve the discounting of projected premiums and claims.
Under the net premium method, the premium taken into account in calculating the provision is determined actuarially, based on the valuation assumptions regarding discount rates, mortality and disability.
The difference between this premium and the actual premium payable provides a margin for expenses.
This method does not allow for voluntary early termination of the contract by the policyholder, and so no assumption is required for persistency.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses including those vesting following the most recent fund valuation, but no such provision is made for future regular or terminal bonuses.
However, this method makes implicit allowance for future regular or terminal bonuses already earned, by margins in the valuation discount rate used.
The gross premium method uses the amount of contractual premiums payable and includes explicit assumptions for interest and discount rates, mortality and morbidity, persistency and future expenses.
These assumptions can vary by contract type and reect current and expected future experience.
Explicit provision is made for vested bonuses and explicit allowance may also be made for future regular bonuses, but not terminal bonuses.
b Group practice The long-term business provision is calculated separately for each of the Groups life operations.
The provisions for overseas subsidiaries have generally been included on the basis of local regulatory requirements, mainly using the net premium method, modied where necessary to reect the requirements of the Companies Act.
Material judgement is required in calculating the provisions and is exercised particularly through the choice of assumptions where there is discretion over these.
In turn, the assumptions used depend on the circumstances prevailing in each of the life operations.
Provisions are most sensitive to assumptions regarding discount rates and mortality morbidity rates.
Bonuses paid during the year are reected in claims paid, whilst those allocated as part of the bonus declaration are included in the movements in the long-term business provision, as detailed in note 7.
The principal assumptions in the UK, France and the Netherlands are: i UK The gross premium method is used for all contracts apart from conventional whole life and endowment assurances in the Norwich Union Life & Pensions and Norwich Union Linked Life Assurance life and annuity funds, where a net premium method is used.
All contracts are assumed to continue for the contractual term and, for consistency with the discount rates, no future regular bonuses are assumed to be added to with-profit business.
For unitised with-profit business, the provisions are valued initially by determining the lower of the current non-guaranteed surrender value and the bid value of units.
This result is then compared with a prospective valuation and the higher result is taken.
The prospective valuation projects future benets assuming that future premiums cease and future bonuses are zero, except for policies with a guaranteed minimum bonus rate where this guaranteed rate is allowed for.
Allowance for persistency is based on actual experience and takes into account the likelihood of a signicantly greater lapse experience on those occasions on which the life company guarantees not to apply a Market Value Reduction charge.
For unit-linked business, the provisions are valued initially by adding a prospective non-unit reserve to the bid value of units.
The prospective non-unit reserve is calculated by projecting the future non-unit cashows on the assumption that future premiums cease.
Where appropriate, allowance for persistency is based on actual experience.
100 Aviva plc 2004 38 Long-term business provision continued The provisions held in respect of guaranteed annuity options are a prudent assessment of the additional liability incurred under the option on a basis and method consistent with that used to value basic policy liabilities, and includes a prudent assessment of the proportion of policyholders who will choose to exercise the option.
Valuation discount rate assumptions are set with regard to yields on the supporting assets and the general level of long-term interest rates as measured by gilt yields.
An explicit allowance for risk is included by restricting the yields for equities and properties with reference to a margin over long-term interest rates or by making an explicit deduction from the yields on corporate bonds, mortgages and deposits, based on historical default experience of each asset class.

ii France The majority of provisions arise from a single premium savings product and are based on the accumulated fund value, adjusted to maintain consistency with the value of the assets backing the policyholder liabilities.
The net premium method is used for prospective valuations, in accordance with local regulation, where the valuation assumptions depend on the date of issue of the contract.
The valuation discount rate also depends on the original duration of the contract and mortality rates are based on industry tables.
There have been no changes in the assumptions since 2003.

39 Provisions for outstanding claims a The ultimate cost of general business outstanding claims is estimated by using a range of standard actuarial claims projection techniques, such as the Chain Ladder and Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods.
Such methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred claims, average costs per claim and ultimate claim numbers for each accident year, based upon the observed development of earlier years and expected loss ratios.
The main assumption underlying these techniques is that past claims development experience can be used to project future claims development and hence ultimate claims costs.
As such, these methods extrapolate the development of paid and incurred losses, average costs per claim and claim numbers for each accident year based on the observed development of earlier years.
In most cases, no explicit assumptions are made regarding future rates of claims ination or loss ratios.
Instead the assumptions used are those implicit in the historic claims development data on which the projections are based.
Judgement is used to assess the extent to which past trends may not apply in future, for example to reect changes in external or market factors such as public attitudes to claiming, economic conditions, levels of claims ination, judicial decisions and legislation, as well as internal factors such as portfolio mix, policy conditions and claims handling procedures.
The approach adopted takes into account, inter alia, the nature and materiality of the business and the type of data available.
Large claims are usually separately assessed, either by being measured at case estimate face value or separately projected in order to reect their future development.
Case estimates are generally set by skilled claims technicians applying their experience and knowledge to the circumstances of individual claims.
Additional qualitative input, such as allowance for one-off occurrences or changes in legislation, policy conditions or portfolio mix, is also used in arriving at the estimated ultimate cost of claims, in order that it represents the most likely outcome, from a range of possible outcomes, taking account of all the uncertainties involved.
Provisions are calculated allowing for reinsurance recoveries and a separate asset is recorded for the reinsurers share, having regard to collectability.

The period of time which will elapse before the liabilities are settled has been estimated by modelling the settlement patterns of the underlying claims and related reinsurance recoveries.
40 Equalisation provision An equalisation provision has been established in the Group accounts as explained in accounting policy U on page 66.
This had the effect of reducing Group and Company shareholders funds by 388 million at the year end 2003: 364 million.
The change in the equalisation provision during the year comprised a reduction of 23 million 2003: 49 million in the balance on the general business technical account and the profit on ordinary activities before tax.

These amounts, together with the issue expenses, are being amortised over the full term of the bonds.
Although these bonds were issued in sterling, the loans have effectively been converted into euro liabilities through the use of financial instruments in a subsidiary undertaking.
The 2.5% perpetual subordinated loan notes were issued by a Dutch subsidiary undertaking to finance the acquisition of NUTS OHRA Beheer BV in 1999.
They are convertible into ordinary shares in Delta Lloyd NV, should there be a public offering of those shares.
These loan notes have a face value of 1489.9 million but, because they are considered to be perpetual, their carrying value is 1172.4 million, calculated in 1999 and based on the future cash ows in perpetuity discounted back at a market rate of interest.
The rate of interest paid on the notes is being gradually increased to a maximum of 2.76% in 2009.

The only material dened benefit schemes are in the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland and, of these, the UK scheme is by far the largest.
The assets of the main UK, Irish and Canadian schemes are held in separate trustee-administered funds and, in the Netherlands, the main scheme is held in a separate foundation which invests in the life funds of the Group.
An actuarial report has been submitted for each of the dened benefit schemes within the last three years, using appropriate methods for the respective countries on local funding bases.
The substantial falls in stock markets worldwide from 2000 to 2002 have affected the funding position of the schemes.
In the UK scheme, the employing companies have agreed to pay additional contributions.
b The Group has continued to account for pensions in accordance with SSAP24 and the disclosures given in section c below are those required by that accounting standard.
FRS17 Retirement Benets was issued in November 2000 and differs from SSAP24 in a number of ways.
These are principally in the choice of assumptions, and that the difference between the market value of assets and liabilities is immediately recognised in the balance sheet under FRS17, whereas changes in assets and liabilities are recognised on a smoothed basis under SSAP24.
The accounting provisions of FRS17 were not expected to be mandatory for the Group until the year ending 31 December 2003 but, in the transitional period, certain disclosures were required in the notes to the accounts.
In November 2002, the Accounting Standards Board issued an amendment to FRS17 which extended the transitional period through to, in the Groups case, the year ending 31 December 2005.
The transitional disclosures, to the extent not given in section c, are set out in section e below.
c In the UK, the Group operates one main pension scheme, the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme.
New entrants join the dened contribution section of the scheme, as the dened benefit section is generally closed to most new employees.
The scheme was valued as at an effective date of 1 April 2002, on a market value basis using the Projected Unit Method.
The main financial assumptions used were a pension increase rate of 2.5%, a salary increase rate of 4.25% and an interest rate of 6.4%.
The scheme had an asset value of 4,639 million, projected accrued liabilities of 4,010 million and a funding level of 116%.
The employer cost of future service benets in respect of dened benefit members for 2004 was 19.7% of pensionable salaries which, after allowing for interest on the prepayment held in the balance sheet and the additional surplus since, led to a net pension cost for the year to 31 December 2004 of 7.2% of pensionable salaries.
The pension cost was then increased to allow for the amounts credited to members accounts under the dened contribution section of the scheme.
The employing companies contributions to the dened benefit section of the scheme throughout 2004 were 25% of employees pensionable salaries, together with the cost of redundancies during the year and an additional payment of 50 million.
The contribution rates for members of the dened contribution section were 8% of pensionable salaries, together with further contributions of up to 4% where members contribute, and the cost of the death-in-service benets.
The employers contribution rate for 2005 for members of the dened benefit section has been agreed as 29% of pensionable salaries together with an additional payment of 51.5 million, while the contribution rates for members of the dened contribution section are the same as for 2004.
As the dened benefit section of the scheme is generally closed to new entrants and the contribution rate is determined using the project unit method, it is expected that the percentage cost of providing future service benets under this section will gradually increase as the membership ages.
In the Netherlands, Canada and Ireland, regular actuarial valuations of the main schemes are made in accordance with local funding and or accounting standards.
Total pension costs for the schemes in these countries have been taken as equal to the locally determined accounting costs or contributions paid to the plans as, at a Group level, these are not considered to be materially different from charges calculated under a detailed application of SSAP24.
The Group also operates a variety of smaller pension arrangements in these and other countries, where costs have also been based on those calculated locally.

Where schemes provide both dened benefit and dened contribution pensions, the assets and liabilities shown exclude those relating to dened contribution pensions.
The gures for the Dutch and Canadian schemes include arrangements to meet other post-retirement obligations to staff in those countries.
The valuation used for these disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated to take account of the requirements of FRS17 in order to assess the liabilities of the major schemes at 31 December 2004.
The updating was made by actuaries in each country, with overall co-ordination by external consultants, Watson Wyatt.
Other than the actuary of the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme and the Dutch arrangements, the actuaries making the calculation were independent of the Group.
Scheme assets are stated at their market values at 31 December 2004.
UK Netherlands Canada Ireland 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 2004 2003 Date of most recent actuarial valuation 1.4.
The expected returns are developed in conjunction with external advisors and take into account both current market expectations of future returns, where available, and historical returns.
These rates have been developed specically for reporting under FRS17 and therefore differ from the rates used in the European embedded value EEV and Longer Term Investment Return LTIR calculations elsewhere in this report.

This is because the nature of the losses and other short-term timing differences which comprise the unrecognised assets are more restricted in their availability for relief against future taxable profits than are the future pension scheme contributions.
vi Movements in the pension schemes deficits on a FRS17 basis comprise: Total 2004 2003 m m deficits in the schemes at 1 January 838 654 Contributions paid into the schemes 220 172 Charge to net operating expenses 157 157 Credit to investment income 29 26 Actuarial losses 130 219 Exchange rate movements on foreign plans 2 6 deficits in the schemes at 31 December 878 838 The change in the net pension deficit calculated under FRS17 is mainly attributable to changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the schemes liabilities, partially offset by an increase in the market value of their assets.
In the UK, the value of the liabilities has increased due to lower corporate bond yields, which are used to set the valuation discount rate, and a higher assumed ination rate.
The increase in asset values is primarily due to an improvement in equity and bond values since the previous year end.
vii The effect on the Groups net assets and retained profits at 31 December 2004 of substituting the FRS17 gures for the corresponding SSAP24 balance sheet entries would be as follows: Net assets profit and loss account reserve 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Totals included in the Group accounts 9,244 7,365 2,682 1,932 Less: pension asset on SSAP24 basis 279 251 279 251 Totals excluding pension net asset 8,965 7,114 2,403 1,681 Less: pension liability on FRS17 basis 619 583 619 583 Totals including pension liability on FRS17 basis 8,346 6,531 1,784 1,098 The pension net asset shown above is after deducting 56 million held within technical reserves in respect of future funding.

Note 39 gives details of the estimation techniques used in determining the general business outstanding claims provision.
Both are estimated to give a result within the normal range of outcomes.
To the extent that the ultimate cost falls outside this range, for example where experience is worse than that assumed for long-term business, or assumptions over general business claims ination may alter in the future, there is uncertainty in respect of this liability.
b Asbestos, pollution and social environmental hazards In the course of conducting insurance business, various companies within the Group receive general insurance liability claims, and become involved in actual or threatened litigation arising therefrom, including claims in respect of pollution and other environmental hazards.
Amongst these are claims in respect of asbestos production and handling in various jurisdictions, including the UK, United States, Australia and Canada.
Given the significant delays that are experienced in the notication of these claims, the potential number of incidents which they cover and the uncertainties associated with establishing liability and the availability of reinsurance, the ultimate cost cannot be determined with certainty.
However, the Groups exposure to such liabilities is not significant and, on the basis of current information and having regard to the level of provisions made for general insurance claims, the directors consider that any costs arising are not likely to have a material impact on the financial position of the Group.
c Guarantees on long-term savings products As a normal part of their operating activities, various Group companies have given guarantees, including interest rate guarantees, in respect of certain long-term insurance and fund management products.
In the UK, in common with other pension and life policy providers, the Group wrote individual and group pension policies in the 1970s and 1980s with a guaranteed annuity rate option GAO.
Since 1993, such policies have become more valuable to policyholders, and more costly for insurers, as current annuity rates have fallen in line with interest rates.
Reserving policies for the cost of GAOs varied until a ruling by the House of Lords in the Equitable Life case in 2000 which effectively required full reserving by all companies.
Prior to the ruling, consistent with the Groups ordinary reserving practice in respect of such obligations, full reserves for GAOs had already been established.
No adjustment was made, or was necessary, to the Groups reserving practice as a result of the ruling.
The directors continue to believe that the existing provisions are sufficient.
d Pensions mis-selling The pensions review of past sales of personal pension policies which involved transfers, opt outs and non-joiners from occupational schemes, as required by the Financial Services Authority FSA, has largely been completed.
A provision of some 50 million 2003: 65 million remains to meet the outstanding costs of the few remaining cases, the anticipated cost of any guarantees provided, and potential levies payable to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme FSCS.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups ability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
110 Aviva plc 2004 48 Contingent liabilities and other risk factors continued e Endowment reviews In December 1999, the FSA announced the findings of its review of mortgage endowments and expressed concern as to whether, given decreases in expected future investment returns, such policies could be expected to cover full repayment of mortgages.
A key conclusion was that, on average, holders of mortgage endowments had enjoyed returns such that they had fared at least as well as they would have done without an endowment.
Nevertheless, following the FSA review, all of the Groups UK mortgage endowment policyholders received policy-specic letters advising them whether their investment was on track to cover their mortgage.
In May 2002, in accordance with FSA requirements, the Group commenced sending out the second phase of endowment policy update letters, which provide policyholders with information about the performance of their policies and advice as to whether these show a projected shortfall at maturity.
The Group will continue to send these updates annually to all mortgage endowment holders, in accordance with FSA requirements.
The Group has made provisions totalling 130 million 2003: 80 million to meet potential mis-selling costs and the associated expenses of investigating complaints.
It continues to be the directors view that there will be no material effect either on the Groups liability to meet the expectations of policyholders or on shareholders.
In August 2004, the Group confirmed its intention to introduce time barring on mortgage endowment complaints, under FSA rules, by the end of 2005.
The Group is writing to its one million endowment policyholders as part of its ongoing review, introducing a time bar on mortgage endowment complaints in the future.
Customers will be given at least 12 months individual notice before a time bar becomes applicable double the six months notice required by the FSA.
f Split capital investment trusts The Groups fund management subsidiary, Morley Fund Management Limited MFML, acts as investment advisor for a number of split capital investment trusts.
In May 2002, the FSA launched extensive and industry-wide investigations into allegations of collusion by fund managers, mis-selling by intermediaries, and the production and distribution of misleading marketing material.
These investigations have now concluded.
MFML is party to an agreement reached between the FSA and a number of rms which were subject to the investigations the Firms.
The FSA and the Firms have agreed a package of 194 million for investors.
The Firms have agreed to contribute, without admissions, to a fund which will be available for distribution to eligible individuals who invested in zero dividend preference shares Zeros and in a number of specified unit trusts and other financial products that invested in Zeros.
MFML has contributed to the fund, and the directors consider that no further material contingent liability exists from these investigations.
g Other The Company and several of its subsidiaries have guaranteed the overdrafts and borrowings of certain subsidiary and associated undertakings.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees and indemnities.
In addition, in line with standard business practice, various Group companies have given guarantees, indemnities and warranties in connection with disposals in recent years of subsidiary and associated undertakings to parties outside the Aviva Group.
In the opinion of the directors, no material loss will arise in respect of these guarantees, indemnities and warranties.
49 Capital commitments In carrying on the business of investment, the Group has entered into future commitments, including property development, after 31 December 2004.
These amounts are not reected in the consolidated Group balance sheet on pages 72 and 73.
The Group has in hand a number of property developments which, under contracts already signed, will require expenditure of 197 million 2003: 181 million for long-term business operations.
50 Related party transactions There are no related party transactions requiring disclosure in accordance with FRS8 Related Party Disclosures.
51 Post balance sheet events After the balance sheet date, the Board of Aviva plc announced the terms of a recommended cash and share offer, to be made by Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Cazenove on behalf of Aviva plc, for the entire issued and to be issued share capital of RAC plc, subject to regulatory approvals.
