Pension costs The Group continues to operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans both in the UK and overseas.
All UK defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants.
SSAP24 Disclosures UK Pensions a Defined contribution schemes Since 1995, the Group has operated a contracted-in defined contribution scheme which is open to UK employees.
It also operates defined contribution executive pension plans for senior executives.
Employer contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they are incurred.
The total pension cost for the Group in respect of UK defined contribution schemes was 2.1 million 2003: 1.7 million.
b Defined benefit schemes The Group continues to operate a number of defined benefit schemes following the mergers of Seton Healthcare Group plc and Scholl PLC to form Seton Scholl in 1998, and the subsequent merger of Seton Scholl and LIG in 1999.
All UK schemes have been closed to new entrants.
The finances of all schemes are assessed regularly by independent actuaries and all assets of the schemes are held in separate trustee administered funds.
The schemes have provided benefits for employees as outlined below: i Seton Prior to 1995, the Group operated a defined benefit scheme for employees.
Accrual of further service-related benefits under this scheme ceased in August 1995, but existing benefits at that date are being maintained.
The latest valuation of the scheme was at 28 February 2003.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are as follows: Return on investments per annum 7% Salary increases per annum 3.9% Pension increases per annum 2.4% The actuarial value of the schemes assets was 11.8 million.
The valuation showed that the schemes assets were sufficient to cover 80 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The total credit to the Group in respect of this scheme was 0.4 million 2003: nil, represented by a pension charge of 0.2 million 2003: nil and an adjustment to reflect the required prepayment.
An amount of 0.4 million 2003: nil is included in prepayments at year end.
ii Scholl Accrual of further service related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in August 2000, but benefits accrued to 31 August 2000 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The most recent valuation by independent actuaries was at 5 April 2003.
The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are as follows: Return on investments per annum 5.30% Salary increases per annum 4.5% Pension increases Pensions accrued to 6 April 1997 Closed section 3% Open section 0% Pensions accrued from 6 April 1997 Closed section 3.25% Open section 2.5% The market value of the schemes assets was 18.2 million.
The valuation showed that the schemes assets were sufficient to cover 83 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The deficit will be reduced by increased employer pension contributions in the future.
The pension charge to the Group in respect of this scheme was 0.4 million 2003: credit of 0.1 million.
An amount of 0.7 million 2003: 1.1 million is included in prepayments.
SSL International plc Annual Report 2004 60 Notes to the Financial Statements 32.
Pension costs continued iii LIG Accrual of further service-related benefits under this defined benefit scheme ceased in January 2001, but benefits accrued to 31 January 2001 continue to be provided from the scheme.
The latest actuarial valuation of the scheme was at 31 March 2003.
The actuarial assumptions that have the most significant effect on the results of the valuation are as follows: Return on investments per annum pre-retirement 7.0% Return on investments per annum post-retirement 5.0% Salary increases per annum 4.0% Pension increases Accrued before 6 April 1997 1.75% Accrued after 6 April 1997 2.5% The market value of the assets was 79.8 million, which was sufficient to cover 56 per cent of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increased in earnings.
This represents a deficit of 62.4 million when compared with the schemes liabilities.
The deficit is being charged to the profit and loss account over the assumed average service life of the members.
