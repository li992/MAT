b During 2002, as part of the legal and scal integration of the Bestfoods businesses, a number of internal ownership changes took place.
These internal transactions, which took place at fair value, did not involve any third party and therefore had no effect on the results or net assets of the consolidated Unilever Group.
The historical cost of the net assets of the business transferred by PLC was greater than the historical cost of the net assets of the business transferred by NV.
As it would be inappropriate to recognise revaluations to assets and liabilities of the Group arising from internal transactions, this imbalance led to NV recording an unrealised gain of 1 646 million on the transfer while PLC recorded an equal and opposite goodwill balance which is eliminated on consolidation.
Further reorganisations in 2003 and 2004 produced a similar type of adjustment as well as a short-term timing difference in the payment of intra-group dividends.
