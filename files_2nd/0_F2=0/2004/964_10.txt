Details of the deferred tax provision are given in note 23.
In addition to the amounts provided in deferred tax, unrecognised assets exist in respect of taxable losses.
No asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as it is not regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits against which to offset these losses.
Any utilisation of these losses in the future may lead to a reduction in effective tax rates.
No deferred tax has been provided in respect of accumulated reserves of overseas subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures as future dividends are expected to be paid out of future earnings.

22 DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS Treasury and risk management A discussion of the objectives, policies and strategies of Group Treasury and Risk Management is given in the financial review on page 14.
Summary of the use of derivative instruments by the Group The Group utilises derivative and equity instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices.
The use of derivative instruments can give rise to credit and market risk.
The Group controls credit risk by entering into derivative contracts only with counterparties who are rated A1 P1, A or better by external rating agencies or who have received specific internal corporate credit approval.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Market risk is the possibility that future changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices may make a derivative instrument more or less valuable.
Since the Group utilises derivative instruments for risk management, market risk relating to derivative instruments will principally be offset by changes in the valuation of the underlying assets, liabilities or transactions being hedged.
Foreign exchange risk The Group uses forward exchange contracts, currency swaps and option contracts to limit the effects of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
The Group also uses these instruments to hedge future transactions and cash flows.
As at 31 December 2004 the net amount of unrecognised hedging gains on all foreign exchange risk-related instruments, which had been deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was $8 million 2003: gain $79 million.
Any ultimate gain or loss resulting from these contracts will be recognised when the instruments expire.
Interest rate risk The Group uses interest rate swap and option contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on a portion of its existing debt and short term investments.
The effect of these derivatives is reflected, as appropriate, in interest expense or interest income.
As at 31 December 2004 the net amount of unrecognised hedging gains on all interest rate risk related instruments, which had been deferred to a period in respect of which an exposure has been hedged, was $1 million 2003: losses $30 million.

Gains or losses resulting from these activities are recognised concurrently with gains and losses associated with underlying transactions.
The majority of the deferred gains or losses are unrecognised and the ultimate amount of gains or losses to be realised will depend on commodity price movements until the end of the hedge contracts concerned.
The net forward position of AngloGold Ashanti was 10.5 million ounces priced forward at 31 December 2004, covering periods up to December 2014, with a marked to market value of negative $1,161 million at 31 December 2004.
The value was based on a gold price of $435 oz, exchange rates of $ ZAR5.67 and $ AU$1.29 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time.
As at 25 January 2005, the marked to market value of the hedge book was a negative $993 million, based on a gold price of $426 oz, exchange rates of $ ZAR5.93 and $ AU$1.30 and the prevailing market interest rates and volatilities at the time.
Concentration of credit risk The Group is exposed to credit risk in respect of current asset investments, debtors and derivative financial instruments.
Given the geographical and business diversity of the Groups debtors, the concentration of credit risk is limited.
In respect of current asset investments and derivative financial instruments, procedures and policies are in place to limit the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure is limited to fair value see note 22 b below.
Numerical disclosures The disclosures present information regarding the Group as a whole and therefore exclude any intra-group loan balances.
The disclosure of financial assets and financial liabilities which follows other than the currency disclosures in note 22 e excludes debtors and other current liabilities, as permitted under FRS 13 Derivatives and other financial instruments: disclosures.

AngloGold Ashanti and Anglo Platinum AngloGold merged with Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited on 26 April 2004.
As a result of this transaction, the Groups shareholding decreased from 55.8% to 47.2% and the Group has therefore had to account for a deemed disposal in accordance with FRS2 Accounting for subsidiary undertakings.
During the year the Group acquired a further 5.2% interest in AngloGold Ashanti, in piecemeal acquisitions and a further 0.9% interest in Anglo Platinum.

As a result of the deemed disposal on the merger of AngloGold with Ashanti Goldfields Company Limited an unrealised profit of $410 million has been recorded in the Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses.
Subsidiaries disposed of in the year principally include Hudson Bay, which was sold in December 2004.

It also operates postretirement medical arrangements in southern Africa and North America.
The policy for accounting for pensions and post-retirement benefits is included in note 1.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds.
The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the basis of contributions payable by the Group in the financial year.
The post-retirement medical arrangements provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants.
Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain criteria.
The majority of these plans are unfunded.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded.
The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice throughout the world.
The unfunded pension plans are principally in Europe and South America.
The retirement benefit charge for the year is as follows: US$ million 2004 2003 Defined contribution pension plans 167 131 Defined benefit pension plans 106 108 Post-retirement medical plans 55 54 Defined contribution plans The defined contribution pension cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
At 31 December 2004, there were no material outstanding prepaid contributions and so no prepayment or accrual has been disclosed in the balance sheet in relation to these plans.
Defined benefit plans The above defined benefit pension plan cost consists of a regular cost of $73 million 2003: $63 million and a variation cost of $33 million 2003: $45 million.
The Group adopts a straight-line method of amortising unrecognised amounts over the future working lifetimes of active employees.
Post-retirement medical plans The accumulated benefit obligation and the annual cost of accrual of benefits are assessed by independent qualified actuaries using the projected unit method.
The accumulated benefit obligation calculated as at 31 December 2004 was $632 million 2003: $527 million.
The provision recorded on the balance sheet as at 31 December 2004 amounted to $529 million 2003: $465 million.

The actuaries have updated the valuations to 31 December 2004.
The actuary to the majority of the South African pension plans is an employee of the Group and is supported by external advisors.
The actuaries to the other plans are independent of the Group.
At 31 December 2004 the estimated market value of the assets of the funded pension plans was $3,479 million 2003: $2,831 million.
The market value of assets was used to determine the funding level of the plans.
The market value of the assets of the funded plans was sufficient to cover 91% 2003: 90% of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected increases in future earnings and pensions.
In particular, the funding levels of the UK funded pension plans have fallen in the past year as a result of an increase in the inflation assumption, although this has been offset by increasing asset values.
Companies within the Group are paying contributions as required in accordance with local actuarial advice.
As the majority of the defined benefit pension plans are closed to new members, it is expected that contributions will increase as the members age.
The benefit obligations in respect of the unfunded plans at 31 December 2004 were $182 million 2003: $154 million.
To the extent that there is a difference between pension costs and contributions paid, a prepayment or provision arises.
The accumulated difference provided in the balance sheet at 31 December 2004 gives rise to a prepayment of $178 million 2003: $170 million and a provision of $224 million 2003: $216 million.
Actuarial assumptions The principal assumptions used to determine the actuarial present value of benefit obligations and pension costs under SSAP 24 are detailed below shown as weighted averages : 2004 2003 2002 Southern The Southern The Southern The Africa Americas Europe Africa Americas Europe Africa Americas Europe %%% % % % % % % Average discount rate for plan liabilities 8.0 7.6 5.3 9.9 7.3 5.5 11.5 7.2 5.6 Average rate of inflation 3.9 3.3 2.7 5.7 2.9 2.6 7.4 3.0 2.3 Average rate of increase in salaries 4.9 4.8 3.5 6.8 4.7 3.4 8.5 4.8 3.1 Average rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.9 5.0 2.8 5.7 5.0 2.8 7.3 3.8 2.6 Average long term rate of return on plan assets 9.4 9.6 6.7 11.0 8.7 7.0 11.9 8.2 6.9 Expected average increase in healthcare costs 5.3 9.3 N A 6.6 7.7 N A 9.8 6.1 N A FRS 17 background In November 2000 the Accounting Standards Board issued FRS 17 Retirement Benefits replacing SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs.
The full implementation of FRS 17 has been deferred, though certain disclosures are required in the transition period for periods ending on or after 22 June 2001.
These further disclosures are included below.
Under SSAP 24, the projected unit method was one of the acceptable valuation methods.
Under FRS 17, it is the only acceptable method of valuation.
The pension plans have been valued historically using the projected unit method and so there is no change to the method of valuation of the defined benefit plans.

The discount rate and other actuarial assumptions are generally the same as for SSAP 24 and are given above.
As stated above, the principal funded schemes all relate to defined benefit pension plans.

34 RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS With effect from 1 June 2001, the cross-holding between Anglo American and fide Beers was eliminated and Anglo American now accounts for its 45% interest in DB Investments DBI, the new holding company of fide Beers Socit Anonyme.
As a result of fide Beers partial interest in Debswana Diamond Company Proprietary Limited one of the shareholders in DBI, Anglo American accounted for an additional 3.65% of DBIs post-tax equity earnings.
As part of an agreement to extend a number of mining licences, this partial interest has been ceded by fide Beers to the Government of the Republic of Botswana.
Following this restructuring, Anglo American will account only for its direct 45% interest in DBI.
Furthermore, Anglo American accounts for the dividends attributable to 10% non-cumulative preference shares with a redemption value of $526 million in DBI as part of operating profit, on the basis that the preference shares are part of Anglo Americans investment in the diamond business.
The Company and its subsidiaries, in the ordinary course of business, enter into various sales, purchase and service transactions with joint ventures and associates and others in which the Group has a material interest.
