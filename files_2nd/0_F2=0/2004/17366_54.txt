Tax information Reclaiming income tax on dividends For all dividends, the tax credit available to individual share owners resident in the UK is one-ninth of the dividend: tax credits are not repayable to UK holders with no tax liability.
Individuals whose income is within the lower or basic tax rate bands are liable to tax at 10% on the dividend income and the tax credit will satisfy their income tax liability on UK dividends.
The higher rate of tax on dividend income is 32.5% with relief available for the tax credit referred to above.
Capital gains tax The market value of an ordinary share at 31 March 1982 was 39p.
Since that date rights issues have occurred in September 1986, August 1987 and April 1993.
For capital gains tax purposes the acquisition cost of ordinary shares is adjusted to take account of such rights issues.
Since any adjustments will depend on individual circumstances, share owners are advised to consult their professional advisors.
