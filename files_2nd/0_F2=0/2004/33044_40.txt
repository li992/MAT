That cost will be recognised over the period during which an employee is required to provide services in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period.
SFAS 123R applies to all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified, repurchased, or cancelled after that date.

d SFAS 151 Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No.
43 On November 24, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board FASB issued FASB Statement No.
151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No.
The amendments made by SFAS 151 clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials spoilage should be recognised as current-period charges require the allocation of fixed production overheads to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facilities.
SFAS151 is the result of a broader effort by the FASB to improve the comparability of cross-border financial reporting by working with the International Accounting Standards Board IASB toward development of a single set of highquality accounting standards.
The FASB and the IASB noted that ARB 43, Chapter 4 and IAS 2, Inventories, are both based on the principle that the primary basis of accounting for inventory is cost.
Both of those accounting standards also require that abnormal amounts of idle freight, handling costs, and wasted materials be recognised as period costs: however, the Boards noted that differences in the wording of the two standards could have led to the inconsistent application of those similar requirements.
The FASB concluded that clarifying the existing requirements in ARB 43 by adopting language similar to that used in IAS 2 is consistent with its goals of improving financial reporting in the United States and promoting convergence of accounting standards internationally.
The guidance is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005.
Earlier application is permitted for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after November 23, 2004.
