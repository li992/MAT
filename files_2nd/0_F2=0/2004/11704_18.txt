259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 46 Notes forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies a Accounting convention The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards, and accounting policies have been applied consistently.
The financial statements fall within the scope of the SORP.
They have been prepared in accordance with the provisions of the SORP currently in effect, except in respect of the recognition of turnover.
The SORP recommends that under and over lifting of oil and gas production be reflected by adjusting cost of sales.
The Group reflects such under and over lifting by adjustment to turnover, as it believes that this treatment shows a more realistic value of the turnover generated from the disclosed production in each year and will aid understanding of the results.
If the Group were to follow the SORP, turnover would be reduced by 5.9 million 2003: 3.7 million and cost of sales would be reduced by the same amount.
There would be no impact on reported profits.
During the year the Group adopted UITF 38, Accounting for ESOP Trusts, which requires that own shares held through an ESOP trust should no longer be shown as the sponsoring companys assets but should be presented as a deduction from shareholders funds within a newly created reserve.
Own shares are held in connection with the Companys Long Term Incentive Plan.
The Group also adopted UITF 17 revised, which requires that the cost of the shares associated with this plan be provided for on the basis of the share price ruling when the shares were awarded, rather than at the expected purchase price for the shares.
In addition, accruals for awards under the Long Term Incentive Plan have been included in reserves.
The adoption results in an increase of 300,000 in profits after tax for 2004 but had no material impact on the prior year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under UITF 17 in respect of Inland Revenue approved SAYE schemes.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The acquisition method of accounting has been adopted.
Under this method, the results of subsidiary undertakings acquired or disposed of in the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss account from the date of acquisition or up to the date of disposal.
The Company has taken advantage of Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 in not presenting its own profit and loss account.
The Groups exploration, development and production activities are generally conducted jointly with other companies.
Since these arrangements do not constitute entities in their own right, the financial statements reflect the relevant proportions of costs, revenues, assets and liabilities applicable to the Groups interests.
c Turnover Turnover includes production on an entitlement basis, reflecting the sales value of the Groups share of oil and gas produced in the year.
Tariff income is also included in turnover.
Turnover is stated net of value added tax.
d Foreign currencies Non-sterling transactions are translated into sterling, or, in the case of Group companies with functional currencies other than sterling, non-functional currency amounts are converted into the functional currency, at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction or at the contracted rate if the transaction is covered by a forward currency contract.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the relevant rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, or at the contracted rate if the asset or liability is covered by a forward currency contract.
Realised exchange differences and unrealised translation differences are taken to the profit and loss account.
On consolidation, assets and liabilities of subsidiary undertakings and branches of the Company are translated into sterling at the exchange rate ruling at the balance sheet date.
Income and cash flow statements are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
Exchange differences resulting from the translation at closing rates of net investments in subsidiary undertakings, together with differences between earnings for the year translated at average and closing rates, are dealt with in reserves.
Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 46 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 47 Notes forming part of the financial statements e Derivative instruments The Group uses commodity price contracts and foreign currency contracts to reduce exposure to foreign exchange rates and oil and gas price movements.
The criteria for forward commodity price contracts are: the instrument must be in respect of, or calculated relative to, commodities that are expected to be produced it must involve the same currency as the hedged item it must reduce the risk of commodity price movement exposure on the Groups operations.
The criteria for forward currency contracts are: the instrument must relate to a future payment or receipt of reasonably certain amount and timing it must involve the same currency as the hedged item it must reduce the risk of currency exchange movements on the Groups operations.
The rates and prices under derivative contracts are used to record the hedged item.
As a result, gains and losses on oil price swaps are reflected in turnover, and gains and losses on foreign currency contracts are offset against the related transaction or included within the balance sheet.
f Fixed assets i Capitalised costs The Group follows the full cost method under which expenditure relating to the acquisition, exploration, appraisal and development of oil and gas interests, including an appropriate share of directly attributable overheads and relevant financing costs, is capitalised in cost pools on the basis of income generating units.
Separate income generating units are established in respect of assets shared between more than one field.
The cost of borrowing in respect of a field development is capitalised until commencement of production from that field.
At 31 December 2004, the Group held assets in five separate regional cost pools for the UK, Scandinavia, Australia, Indonesia and Tunisia and two shared asset cost pools in respect of certain UK and Scandinavian assets.
Exploration and acquisition expenditure not related to commercial reserves is carried outside the full cost pools, as intangible costs, pending determination of commercial reserves or indications of impairment.
ii Depletion and depreciation Costs relating to evaluated properties are amortised, by pool, on a unit of production basis or, in the case of shared assets, on a unit of throughput basis, over proven and probable reserves, taking account of estimates of the future costs of development relating to those reserves.
Changes in estimates are taken into account prospectively.
Other fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic life as follows: Office equipment 3 7 years Leasehold improvements 10 years Disposal proceeds in respect of oil and gas assets are taken to the relevant cost pool and no gain or loss on disposal is recognised.
iii Decommissioning Provision for future decommissioning costs is made when the underlying assets to be decommissioned are first placed in situ or when the assets are first acquired, if later.
The provision for future decommissioning is calculated before corporate tax based on future cash flows discounted at rates to reflect risks specific to the costs.
An amount equivalent to the initial provision for decommissioning costs is capitalised and amortised over the life of the underlying asset on a unit of production basis over proven and probable reserves.
Changes to the provision, other than unwinding of the discount, are taken into account prospectively.
Unwinding of the discount of future decommissioning provisions is included as a separate financial item in the profit and loss account under the net interest heading.

h Deferred taxation Deferred tax is provided for in respect of substantially all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be recovered against future profits.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
i Lease payments Assets held under finance leases, which are leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset have passed to, or remain with, the Group, are capitalised in the balance sheet and are depreciated as set out above.
The capital elements of future obligations under such leases are included as liabilities in the balance sheet.
The interest elements of the rental payments are charged to the profit and loss account over the periods of the leases and represent a constant proportion of the original capital element.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis.
j Cash and liquid resources Cash, for the purposes of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand, less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources comprise funds held in term deposit accounts.
k Pensions The Group contributed to personal pension arrangements for its employees.
Pension scheme assets are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
The amount charged against profits represents contributions payable in respect of the accounting period.
The Group has no defined benefit pension obligations.
l Restatement 5.5 million of capital stocks were transferred from stock to fixed assets.
The revised treatment more accurately reflects the nature of these items.
The adjustment in respect of these stocks has been made to the opening balances of stock and fixed assets as at 1 January 2004 and the 2003 figures have been restated to reflect a consistent basis.
Turnover includes third party turnover by origin, which is materially the same as turnover by destination.

Based on current capital investment plans, the Group does not expect to pay any UK taxes during 2005 or 2006 owing to the availability of 100% first year allowances from recent acquisitions and development expenditure in 2005.
The Group will continue to be liable for tax at rates higher than the standard rate of UK corporation tax on its upstream profits in the UK, Norway, Indonesia, Australia and Tunisia.
Overseas taxes are generally calculated in non-sterling currencies and the Group is exposed to fluctuations in the value of these currencies.

The National Insurance provision is based on the difference between the year-end share price of 1.75 and the exercise price and is allocated over the period between the date of the award and the date the options are expected to become unconditional.
The decommissioning expenditure is expected to be incurred between 2009 and 2018.
The deferred tax charge for the year arises mainly as a result of timing differences in relation to capital expenditure allowances.

i The interest rate profile of the Groups financial assets and liabilities as at 31 December was as follows: 2004 2003 Floating rate of interest Floating rate of interest Bank debt Bank debt and finance and finance Cash leases Cash leases Currency 000 000 000 000 Sterling 1,639 34,500 121 26,500 US Dollars 700 73,703 1,149 84,811 939 108,203 1,270 111,311 The interest rates earned on cash balances were based on market rates determined on a daily basis.
All cash and bank debt balances at 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2003 were at floating rates of interest, and therefore there is no difference between the fair value and the book value of these items.
The interest paid on bank debt was linked to LIBOR.
ii As at 31 December 2004, currency exposures were as follows: Functional currency of Group operation Sterling US Dollar Total Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 000 000 000 Sterling 23,674 23,674 US Dollar Australian Dollar 10,978 10,978 Norwegian Kroner 32,135 32,135 Danish Kroner 1,421 1,421 Tunisian Dinar 589 589 Euro 217 217 Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 60 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 61 Notes forming part of the financial statements With the exception of current tax balances in Scandinavia, all significant debtor and creditor balances at 31 December 2003 were denominated in the functional currency of the company holding such balances.
The exposure to exchange rate variances on Scandinavian tax balances is mitigated by forward selling US dollars to meet anticipated tax payments.
As a result, only minimal gains and losses from exchange movements were recognised in the Group profit and loss account during 2003. iii Fair value There are no material differences between the book values and fair values of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities, except for the unrecognised gains and losses on commodity hedges.
The fair values of the commodity hedges, which have a nil book value, are shown below.
iv Gains and losses on hedges Gains and losses on instruments used for commodity hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on instruments used for hedging purposes, which reflect the difference between the book value of nil and fair value, are as follows: Gains Losses Net 000 000 000 At 1 January 2004 692 14,418 13,726 Gains and losses arising in the previous year that were recognised during the year 692 11,700 11,008 Amounts arising during the year 1,033 31,207 30,174 At 31 December 2004 1,033 33,925 32,892 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 23,031 23,031 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2006 or later 1,033 10,894 9,861 Gains Losses Net 000 000 000 At 1 January 2003 1,451 6,905 5,454 Gains and losses arising in the previous year that were recognised during the year 1,451 10,960 9,509 Amounts arising during the year 692 18,473 17,781 At 31 December 2003 692 14,418 13,726 Of which: Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2004 692 11,700 11,008 Gains and losses expected to be recognised in 2005 or later 2,718 2,718 Paladin Resources plc Annual report and accounts 2004 61 259 7408 MF Paladin AR TP 7 4 05 5:45 pm Page 62 Notes forming part of the financial statements continued 18 Reconciliation of movements in equity shareholders funds Group Group Company Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 as restated as restated 000 000 000 000 Opening shareholders funds 147,648 105,991 149,279 98,956 Profit for the year 35,782 28,446 1,360 11,245 Dividend 5,483 5,033 5,483 5,033 Issue of shares 1,195 41,742 1,195 41,742 Shares acquired 225 1,164 225 1,164 UITF 17 LTIP movement 63 1,164 63 1,164 Foreign exchange differences 9,251 23,498 2,538 2,369 Closing equity shareholders funds 169,603 147,648 148,601 149,279 19 Commitments and guarantees i Capital commitments at 31 December were: Group Group Company Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Contracted but not provided 150,700 89,409 ii Annual commitments under non-cancellable operating leases, all in respect of land and buildings, are as follows: Group Group Company Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Operating leases which expire: Within one year 130 Within two to five years 655 480 534 335 After five years 328 614 80 614 983 1,224 614 949 iii Annual commitments under finance leases are as follows: Group Group Company Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 000 000 000 000 Amounts payable: Within one year 879 1,126 Within two to five years 4,189 4,504 After five years 1,126 5,068 6,756 Less finance charges allocated to future periods 672 716 4,396 6,040 iv The Company has guaranteed the bank borrowings of its subsidiaries.
