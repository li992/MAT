78 Slough Estates plc | Annual Report 2004 Notes to the financial statements 1 Restatement In accordance with UITF 38, which became effective for accounting periods ending on or after 22 June 2004, consideration paid by the Employee Share Ownership Plans ESOPs trust for the companys own shares is deducted from shareholders equity.
The shares held by the ESOPs trust are treated as if they were cancelled for the purposes of calculating earnings and net assets per ordinary share.
Previously all shares held by the ESOPs trust were held in prepayments at cost less amounts written off.
Where appropriate, previously reported gures have been restated to show the financial effect of this change in accounting policy.
There is no effect on the profits for the current and prior periods.
The effect on shareholders funds is shown in note 10 of these financial statements.
Previously it was the companys practice to settle the tax charges of the company and its UK subsidiaries and the company made provision for its subsidiaries tax liabilities in its own financial statements.
In 2004, the company changed this policy to allow the UK subsidiaries to suffer their own tax liabilities including deferred tax.
The directors consider that this will give a fairer presentation of the tax effects of each companys results within the Group.
Prior year gures have been restated accordingly.
The total reserves of the parent company are unchanged.
The restatement has had the effect of reducing the valuation of investments in subsidiaries by 104.4 million, reducing provision for liabilities and charges deferred taxation by 99.6 million and creditors falling due within one year taxation by 4.8 million.
The 2003 exceptional provision above was in respect of the residential leisure development at Quail West in Florida.

The USA tax losses resulting from accelerated capital allowance claims have been substantially utilised in 2004 as a result of property sales.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries, associate and joint ventures.
In the event of their remittance to the UK, no net UK tax is expected to be payable.

In 2003, the effect of the preference shares was anti-dilutive and therefore they were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation.
The preference shares are dilutive in 2004 and 2003 for the purpose of the diluted net assets per share calculations and have been treated as such.
The Group has also presented an adjusted basic earnings per share gure to exclude the impact of exceptional items, profits and losses on the sale of investment properties net of taxation and minority interests and deferred tax in respect of investment properties.
The directors consider that this adjusted gure gives a more meaningful comparison for the periods shown in the consolidated financial statements.
Deferred tax has been excluded from the adjusted calculation as the Group has no plans to sell a significant proportion of its investment properties, and in any case it is generally very unusual for UK capital allowances to be recaptured on the disposal of a property.
profits and losses on the sale of investment properties are excluded from adjusted earnings as these are non-recurring items.
Net assets per share are calculated on the equity shareholders funds of 2,310.2 million 2003 2,038.3 million restated.
Adjusted net assets per share have been calculated on the same number of shares but shareholders funds exclude the deferred tax liability of 200.9 million 2003 193.1 million as it is the opinion of the directors that deferred tax on capital allowances in relation to investment properties is unlikely to crystallise materially in practice.
11 Goodwill The goodwill arose from the acquisition on 15 December 2004 of Ravenseft Industrial Estates Limited, a subsidiary of Land Securities Group PLC see note 23.
The negative goodwill amounting to 4.7 million is required to be shown as a negative balance on the balance sheet within xed assets.
The amount is not amortised and will only be released to profit and loss account on the eventual sale of the properties acquired.

Group Company 2004 2003 2004 2003 m m m m Deferred taxation consists of: Accelerated capital allowances 59.7 63.6 6.5 Overseas depreciation allowances 52.9 53.7 Interest capitalised 69.5 75.3 11.3 18.5 Tax losses 5.0 13.9 Deferred tax assets 0.5 0.5 Acquired on acquisition 4.1 Other timing differences 20.2 14.9 15.3 13.6 Total deferred tax in respect of investment properties 200.9 193.1 26.6 38.6 Deferred tax asset in respect of Quail West 13.1 14.6 Other deferred tax 4.3 3.8 1.1 1.3 192.1 182.3 27.7 39.9 The deferred tax assets at 31 December 2004 relate to the exceptional provision for Quail West and deferred costs in USA 0.5 million 2003 in Canada 0.5 million.
The Group has a commitment to support the ongoing activities at the residential leisure development at Quail West until the overall activity reaches a certain level, which is not expected to occur for a number of years.
In accordance with UK GAAP, the Group has therefore recognised a provision for the estimated net liability arising from this commitment.
The balance of the provision at 31 December 2004 amounted to 18.0 million 2003 20.8 million.
The most significant assumption in the determination of the provision is the rate of membership sales and the consequent timing of the release of the Groups commitment.
The Group board is satisfied that the assumptions used to compute the provision are appropriate and will continue to review these at each balance sheet date.
The provision is stated at present value.
It will be amortised to the profit and loss account after allowing for the unwind of the discount used, on the basis of the actual losses incurred by the ongoing activities.
The other liabilities relate principally to provisions for onerous leases on rented properties and represent the estimated liability of future costs for lease rentals and dilapidation costs less the expected receipts from sub-letting these properties which are surplus to business requirements.
The estimated amount of potential taxation, for which no provision has been made and which would arise if the assets held as long-term investments were sold at the values at which they appear in the balance sheet, amounts to 176.5 million 2003 129.5 million.

Their assets are held by trustees separately from the assets of the employer.
Contributions to the schemes, which are assessed in accordance with the advice of independent qualied actuaries on the basis of triennial valuations using the projected unit method of calculation, are charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
As at 31 December 2004, the Group had a pension prepayment of 0.6 million 2003 0.7 million representing the unamortised cost of a 1.4 million cash contribution made in 1998 to eliminate the then calculated SSAP 24 deficit in the Slough scheme.
This cost is being amortised to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis and will be fully amortised by the year ended 31 December 2008.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Slough scheme, as at 31 March 2001, was carried out by William M Mercer.
The schemes assets were valued at market value.
The assumptions used to calculate the liabilities of the scheme included investment returns 2.0 per cent per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase and 2.25 per cent higher than the rate of increase in pensions.
In order to calculate the contribution rate required, longer-term assumptions of investment returns 2.25 per cent per annum higher than the rate of annual salary increase were used.
At the date of the latest valuation, the market value of the assets of the scheme was 42.4 million and the actuarial value of those assets represented 94 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for assumed future increases in earnings.
As a consequence, the company contribution rate was increased in 2001 by 6.08 per cent per annum to 24.97 per cent per annum.
The latest actuarial valuation of the Bilton scheme, as at 5 April 2001, was carried out by Hewitt Bacon & Woodrow.
The assets of the scheme were valued at market value.
The main assumptions used were investment returns 2.4 per cent per annum higher than the increase to pensions in payment and 2.4 per cent more than increases to pensions in deferment.
At the valuation date the market value of the assets of the scheme was 23.8 million and the actuarial value of those assets represented 117 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members, after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
The actuary has recommended that no contributions are required from Bilton p. l. c. Hewitt have produced a draft triennial valuation of the Slough and Bilton pension schemes as at 31 March 2004 and 5 April 2004 respectively.
As these actuarial valuations have not been nalised, their contents have not been disclosed in the financial statements as part of SSAP 24 disclosure requirements.
The draft report for the Slough scheme indicates that the market value of the assets are 44.6 million and the actuarial value of those assets represented 61 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members.
The draft report of the Bilton scheme indicates that the market value of the assets are 20.6 million and the actuarial value of those assets represented 96 per cent of the benets that had accrued to members.
