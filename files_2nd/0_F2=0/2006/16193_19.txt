Bank loans and overdrafts continued Wherever possible the Company conducts and manages its business in Sterling UK and US Dollars, the functional currencies of the industry in the areas in which it operates.
At 31 December 2006 the only material monetary assets or liabilities of the Company that were not denominated in the functional currency were $280 million 142.9 million cash drawings under the US$850 million Borrowing Base Facility held as a hedge against US$ denominated net assets in subsidiaries in the Companys Group Accounts.
Interest rate risk The interest rate profile of the Companys financial assets and liabilities at 31 December 2006 was as follows: Stg US$ Total 000 000 000 Cash at bank at floating interest rate 9,001 9,001 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 133 577 710 Fixed rate debt 30,000 63,806 93,806 Floating rate debt 40,000 79,118 119,118 Net debt 60,866 142,347 203,213 The profile at 31 December 2005 for comparison purposes was as follows: Stg US$ Total 000 000 000 Cash at bank on which no interest is received 26 26 Fixed rate debt 42,500 34,286 76,786 Floating rate debt 51,516 68,573 120,089 Net debt 93,990 102,859 196,849 Cash at bank at floating interest rate consisted of deposits which earn interest at rates set in advance for periods ranging from overnight to one month by reference to Sterling or US Dollar LIBOR.
Floating rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance from overnight to three months at rates determined by US Dollar LIBOR and Sterling LIBOR.
Fixed rate debt comprises bank borrowings at interest rates fixed in advance for periods greater than three months or bank borrowings where the interest rate has been fixed through interest rate hedging.
The Borrowing Base Facility incurs interest on outstanding debt at Sterling LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 240 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets and US Dollar LIBOR plus a margin ranging from 110 basis points to 240 basis points depending on utilisation and concentration of non-OECD assets.
The outstanding debt is repayable in variable amounts determined semi-annually over the period to 31 August 2012, or such other time as is determined by reference to the remaining reserves of the assets, whichever is earlier.
There is no requirement under the Borrowing Base Facility to hedge interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR.
The Borrowing Base Facility states that consideration should be given to hedging at least 30% of the interest rate exposure to fluctuations in LIBOR for Sterling and US Dollars in respect of loans under the facility from time to time, net of relevant cash balances.
In the above table for 2006, 93.8 million of the gross debt has been shown as fixed rate debt as the particular bank borrowings were fixed in November 2006 for a six month duration.
In December 2005, the Company executed an interest rate hedging programme effective February 2006, whereby 50% of the projected interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR and US Dollar LIBOR was hedged through the application of a series of interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars.
The effect of these derivatives limits the interest rate exposure to Sterling LIBOR at 5.7% and US Dollar LIBOR at 5.8%.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars were put in place for a three year period for US Dollar expiring November 2008 and for an 18 month period for Sterling LIBOR expiring May 2007 at varying notional principal amounts.
The interest rate swaps, options and zero cost collars do not give rise to material differences between book and fair values.
Therefore the hedged amounts are included in Floating Rate Debt in the above 2006 table.

Share based payments 2005 Performance Share Plan PSP Under the PSP, senior executives can receive conditional awards of rights over whole shares worth up to 150% of salary p. a.
Awards vest under the PSP subject to a TSR based performance condition under which the Companys TSR performance is measured over the fixed three year period against both the constituents of the FTSE 250 index excluding investment trusts the Index and a comparator group of oil and gas companies.
Half of an award is tested against the Index and the other half against the comparator group.
The test is over a three year period starting on 1 January prior to grant, and an individual must normally remain in employment for three years from the date of grant for the shares to vest.
No dividends are paid to participants over the vesting period.
Further details in relation to the PSP award measurements are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
The shares outstanding under the PSP are as follows: Average weighted PSP Shares share price at grant p Outstanding at 1 January 2006 1,784,417 187.50 Granted 1,118,665 354.01 Outstanding at 31 December 2006 2,903,082 251.66 The inputs of the option valuation model were: Risk free interest rate 4.5-4.7% p. a.
Expected volatility 32% Dividend yield 1.0-1.1% p. a.
The expected life is the period from the date of grant to the vesting date.
The weighted average fair value of the awards granted in 2006 was 264.96p per award.
The Company recognised a total expense of 1,392,000 2005: 311,000 in respect of the PSP.
2005 Deferred Share Bonus Plan DSBP Under the DSBP, the portion of any annual bonus entitlement above 60% of the base salary of a senior executive nominated by the Remuneration Committee is required to be deferred into shares.
Shares awarded under the DSBP will normally vest following the end of the period of three financial years commencing with that in which the award is granted.
The shares outstanding under the DSBP are as follows: DSBP Shares Share price at grant Outstanding at 1 January 2006 Granted 79,787 348.5p Outstanding at 31 December 2006 79,787 348.5p The inputs of the option valuation model were: Dividend yield 1.1% p. a.
The fair value of the awards granted in 2006 was 337.2p per award.
The Company recognised a total expense of 74,000 2005: nil in respect of the DSBP.
2000 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS Options granted under the 2000 ESOS normally only become exercisable following the third anniversary of the date of the grant if the performance condition has been met.
The awards are tested against the Index and 100% of awards will vest if the Companys TSR is above the median of the Index over the three year period following grant.
Options awarded under the 2000 ESOS before 24 May 2005 are subject to monthly re-testing on a rolling three year basis if the TSR performance criterion is not met.
Options granted on or after 24 May 2005 are not subject to monthly re-testing.
Options have previously been granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS.
Options granted under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS are not subject to performance conditions.
All awards under the 1988 ESOS and the 1998 ESOS were made prior to 7 November 2002 and therefore, under the FRS transitional provisions, they have not been accounted for in accordance with FRS 20 share based payments.

Share based payments continued UK and Irish Share Incentive Plans SIPs The SIPs were launched at the beginning of 2004.
These are all-employee plans, which have been set up in both the UK and Ireland that enable employees to make contributions out of salary up to prescribed limits each month, which are used by the Plan trustees to acquire Tullow shares Partnership Shares.
The Company makes a matching contribution to the trustees to acquire a matching number of Tullow shares Matching Shares on a one-for-one basis.
The SIPs have a three month accumulation period.
The fair value of a Matching Share is the market value at grant adjusted for any options included.
For this purpose, the grant date is the start of the accumulation period.
For the UK plan, Partnership Shares are purchased at the lower of the market values at the start of the Accumulation Period and the purchase date.
For the Irish Plan, shares are bought at the market price at the purchase date.
Matching shares vest three years after grant and dividends are paid to the employee during this period.
The Company recognised a total expense of 55,000 2005: 31,000 for the matching shares and 7,000 2005: 4,000 for the partnership shares.
