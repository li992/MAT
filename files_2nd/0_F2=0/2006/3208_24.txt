Centrica plc Annual Review 2006 08 Securing future energy supplies Piping in investment British Gas contracts have underpinned the investment by a consortium of Norwegian companies in the new Langeled pipeline from Norway to the UK.
We are set to receive about a fifth of the gas that comes via the pipeline through a 10-year 6 billion contract with Statoil.
This investment is another example of how the Company is securing long-term gas supplies for its British Gas customers as well as answering the UKs need for new gas sources.
Centrica Energy managed the construction of the terminal at Easington on the Yorkshire coast which is receiving gas from the pipeline.
Centrica Storage is now operating the terminal.
The opening of the 745-mile Langeled pipeline, the worlds longest subsea pipeline, in October 2006 helped bring an immediate fall in wholesale gas prices.
An increased supply of gas into the UK is set to bring greater stability to prices.
Rough is ready Centrica Storage runs the UKs largest storage facility at Rough, holding more than 70% of the gas the country keeps in store.
The business is seeking to expand Roughs capacity to meet the growing need for gas storage in the UK.
