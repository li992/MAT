qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 37 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 1 Accounting policies The financial statements of the Group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
These comprise standards and interpretations approved by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB, together with interpretations of the International Accounting Standards and Standing Interpretations Committee approved by the International Accounting Standards Committee IASC that remain in effect, to the extent that they have been adopted by the European Union.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
Where presentational guidance set out in the Statement of Recommended Practice the SORP for investment trusts issued by the Association of Investment Companies the AIC in January 2003 revised in December 2005 is consistent with the requirements of IFRS, the directors have sought to prepare the financial statements on a basis compliant with the recommendations of the SORP.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and the entity controlled by the Company its subsidiary made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benets from its activities.
All intragroup transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c Presentation of Income Statement In order to better reect the activities of an investment trust company, and in accordance with guidance issued by the AIC, supplementary information which analyses the Income Statement between items of a revenue and capital nature has been presented alongside the Income Statement.
In accordance with the Companys status as a UK investment company under section 266 of the Companies Act 1985, net capital returns may not be distributed by way of dividend.
Additionally, the net revenue is the measure the directors believe appropriate in assessing the Groups compliance with certain requirements set out in section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. d Income Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue for the year on an ex-dividend basis.
Where no exdividend date is available, dividends receivable on or before the year end are treated as revenue for the year.
Provision is made for any dividends not expected to be received.
The xed returns on debt securities and non-equity shares are recognised on a time apportionment basis so as to reect the effective yield on the debt securities and shares.
Interest receivable from cash and short term deposits is accrued to the end of the period.
Stock lending fees and underwriting commission are recognised as earned.
Where the Group has elected to receive its dividends in the form of additional shares rather than cash, the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as income.
Any excess in the value of shares received over the amount of cash dividend foregone is recognised as a gain in the Income Statement.
e Expenses All expenses and interest payable are accounted for on an accruals basis.
Expenses are presented as capital where a connection with the maintenance or enhancement of the value of the investments can be demonstrated.
In this respect the investment management fees and finance costs are allocated 25% to revenue and 75% to capital to reect the Boards expectations of long term investment returns.
Any performance fees payable are allocated wholly to capital, reecting the fact that, although they are calculated on a total return basis, they are expected to be attributable largely, if not wholly, to capital performance.
Transaction costs incurred on the acquisition or disposal of investments are expensed and included in the costs of acquisition or deducted from the proceeds of sale as appropriate.
f Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the period.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date.
qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 38 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 1 Accounting policies continued f Taxation continued In line with the recommendations of the SORP, the allocation method used to calculate tax relief on expenses presented against capital returns in the supplementary information in the Income Statement is the marginal basis.
Under this basis, if taxable income is capable of being offset entirely by expenses presented in the revenue return column of the Income Statement, then no tax relief is transferred to the capital return column.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Investment trusts which have approval as such under section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the Income Statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
g Investments held at fair value through profit or loss When a purchase or sale is made under a contract, the terms of which require delivery within the timeframe of the relevant market, the investments concerned are recognised or derecognised on the trade date.
All the Groups investments are dened by IFRS as investments held at fair value through profit or loss.
All investments are designated upon initial recognition as held at fair value through profit or loss, and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value, which is either the bid price or the last traded price, depending on the convention of the exchange on which the investment is quoted.
Investments in unit trusts or OEICs are valued at the closing price, the bid price or the single price as appropriate, released by the relevant investment manager.
Fair values for unquoted investments, or for investments for which there is only an inactive market, are established by using various valuation techniques.
These may include recent arms length market transactions, the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash ow analysis, option pricing models and reference to similar quoted companies.
Where there is a valuation technique commonly used by market participants to price the instrument and that technique has been demonstrated to provide reliable estimates of prices obtained in actual market transactions, that technique is utilised.
Where no reliable fair value can be estimated for such instruments, they are carried at cost, subject to any provision for impairment.
h Cash and cash equivalents Cash comprises cash in hand and demand deposits.
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignicant risk of changes in value.
i Dividends payable Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.
Final dividends are not recognised until approved by the shareholders in general meeting.
j Non current liabilities All debentures and secured bonds are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration received, less issue costs where applicable.
After initial recognition, all interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on settlement.
The costs of arranging any interest-bearing loans are capitalised and amortised over the life of the loan.
k Foreign currency translation Transactions involving foreign currencies are converted at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities that are fair valued and are denominated in foreign currencies are re-translated into sterling at the rate ruling on the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the Income Statement.
qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 39 1 Accounting policies continued l Accounting developments At the date of authorisation of these financial statements a number of standards had been published by the IASB but were not yet effective.
These include: IFRS 7, Financial Instruments Disclosures: and IFRS 8, Operating Segments The directors anticipate that the adoption of IFRS7 and IFRS8 in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements except for additional disclosures.
m Derivative financial instruments The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in market prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.
Derivative transactions which the Company may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Companys investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings and futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings.
The Company may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the portfolio managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies as approved by the Board, which has set written principles for the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the Income Statement as they arise.
If capital in nature, the associated change in value is presented as a capital item in the Income Statement.

qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 42 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 7 Taxation continued c Deferred tax Due to the Companys status as an investment trust, and the intention to continue meeting the conditions required to obtain approval in the foreseeable future, the Company has not provided deferred tax on any capital gains and losses arising on the revaluation or disposal of investments.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on income outstanding at the end of the year as this will be covered by unrelieved business charges and eligible unrelieved foreign tax 2005: nil.
d Factors that may effect future tax charges The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset of 11,614,000 2005: 11,249,000 arising as a result of having unrelieved loan relationship deficits and eligible unrelieved foreign tax.
It is unlikely that the Company will obtain relief for these in the future so no deferred tax asset has been recognised.
8 Dividends Year ended Year ended 31 December 31December 2006 2005 000 000 Amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year: Second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2005 of 5.00p 2004: 4.90p per ordinary share 14,050 16,123 First interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 3.90p 2005: 3.80p per ordinary share 10,189 11,654 Write-back of unclaimed dividends relating to prior years 4 39 24,235 27,738 Proposed second interim dividend for the year ended 31 December 2006 of 5.30p 2005: 5.00p per ordinary share 13,677 14,050 The final dividend accrued in respect of the year ended 31 December 2004 at 4.90p per share, amounted to 16,608,000.
The buy-backs of the Companys shares, after 31 December 2004 but before the record date of the final dividend, resulted in a write-back of dividends accrued in respect of the year but not in the event payable.
The comparative gure of 16,123,000 for the dividends paid is net of this write-back.
Due to the change in the treatment of dividends under IFRS, no dividend was accrued at 31 December 2005.
The proposed second interim dividend has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.
Set out below is the total dividend to be paid in respect of the year.
This is the basis on which the requirements of section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 are considered.

qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 43 9 Earnings per ordinary share The earnings per ordinary share gure is based on the net profit for the year of 132,831,000 year ended 31 December 2005: 250,323,000 and on 269,065,426 ordinary shares year ended 31 December 2005: 312,435,597, being the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year.
The earnings per ordinary share gure detailed above can be further analysed between revenue and capital, as below.
The Company has no securities in issue that could dilute the return per ordinary share.
Therefore the basic and diluted earnings per ordinary share are the same.
These comprise mainly stamp duty and commission.

At 31 December 2005 there was one such investment but it did not represent more than 1% of the Companys investments and therefore is not considered significant in the context of these accounts.
Where the Company holds investments representing more than 20% of a class of equity share capital, they are not accounted for as associated undertakings if, in the opinion of the directors, the Company does not exercise significant inuence over the financial or operating policies of the investee companies.
v Unquoted investments The value of the unquoted investments as at 31 December 2006 was 41,487,000 2005: 10,961,000 and the portfolio comprised the following four holdings: Valuation 000Investments Investment type 36,420 UBS Loan Note see note 10 vi below 4,125 Cazenove Group Limited see note 10 vii below 600 Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited see note 10 vii below 342 Henderson Unquoted Growth Equities Fund investment fund 5,067 41,487 vi UBS Loan Note The capital value of this Loan Note rises and falls with the return on the Mellon Offshore Enhanced Currency Opportunity Fund.
The Loan Note matures on 31 December 2011 but can be redeemed on the last business day of each calendar month prior to the maturity date.
The Loan Note is valued monthly.
vii Cazenove Cazenove Group Limited formerly Cazenove Group plc Cazenove was established by the partners of Cazenove & Co. to incorporate the business of that rm, to raise additional capital and to seek a stock market quotation in due course.
It has since combined its investment banking business with that of JP Morgan to form JP Morgan Cazenove.
Its asset management business has been transferred to a separate entity, Cazenove Capital Holdings Limited.

The nominal value of the Secured Bonds is redeemable on 15 December 2025.
The nominal value of the Debenture Stock is redeemable on 1 October 2016.
During the year the Company made a market purchase for cancellation of nil 2005: 170,000 of the Debenture Stock at a premium to the nominal value.
The Debenture Stock and the Secured Bonds are secured by oating charges over all the undertaking and assets of the Company.
The security of the charges applies pari passu to both issues.
qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 46 Notes to the Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2006 continued 14 Financial instruments i Management of risk The Groups financial instruments comprise: equity shares, bonds, cash, index futures and other derivatives that are held in accordance with the Groups investment objective as set out on page 1: debenture stock, secured bonds, preference shares, term loans and bank overdrafts, the main purpose of which is to raise finance for the Groups operations: and cash and short-term debtors and creditors that arise directly from the Groups operations.
Derivative transactions which the Group may enter into comprise forward exchange contracts the purpose of which is to manage currency risks arising from the Groups investing activities, quoted options on shares held within the portfolio, or on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in the capital values of the holdings and futures contracts on indices appropriate to sections of the portfolio the purpose of which is to provide protection against falls in capital values of the holdings.
The Group may also write options on shares represented in the portfolio where such options are priced attractively relative to the portfolio managers longer term expectations for the relevant share prices.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are due to uctuations in market prices, foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Board regularly reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained constant throughout the year under review.
Market price risk Market price risk arises mainly from uncertainty about the future prices of financial instruments used in the Groups operations.
It represents the potential loss the Group might suffer through holding market positions in the face of price movements and movements in exchange rates.
It is the Boards policy to hold an appropriate spread of investments in the portfolio in order to reduce the risk arising from factors specic to a particular country or sector.
The allocation of assets to international markets and stock selection are other factors which act to reduce market price risk.
The portfolio managers actively monitor market prices throughout the year and report to the Board, which meets regularly in order to consider investment strategy.
Foreign currency risk The Groups total return and net assets can be signicantly affected by uctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a portion of the Groups assets and revenue are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The international spread of investments acts to reduce this risk.
Borrowings in foreign currencies are limited to levels appropriate to the asset exposure to those currencies.
Since December 2006 the Company has held an investment in a managed currency fund see note 10 vi on page 44.
Although this investment does not increase the overall exposure to foreign currencies, it may increase the Companys exposure to foreign currency risk.
Interest rate risk The Group nances its operations through its debenture stock, secured bonds, preference shares and term loans as well as bank overdrafts and any retained revenues arising from operations.
The Group borrows, in sterling or in foreign currencies, at both xed and oating rates of interest.
The Board imposes borrowing limits to ensure that gearing levels are appropriate to market conditions and reviews these limits on a regular basis.
Liquidity risk The Groups assets mainly comprise readily realisable securities which can be sold to meet commitments if necessary.
The maturity of the Groups existing borrowings is set out in paragraph iii on page 47.
Short term exibility is achieved through the use of loan and overdraft facilities.
Credit risk The Group places funds with authorised deposit takers from time to time and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of any such institution.
The Group expects to place any deposits on a short term basis only.
In December 2006 the Company invested in a loan note see note 10 vi on page 44 and is therefore potentially at risk from the failure of the issuer.
The Company lends securities from its portfolio, within limits set by the Board.
It receives collateral of a value greater than the value of the securities lent, usually, in respect of UK securities, in the form of Crest DBVs.
This collateral is subject to concentration limits, to a margin of a set percentage and to regular revaluation.
qxd 9 3 07 11:01 pm Page 47 14 Financial instruments continued ii Interest rate risk prole of financial assets and financial liabilities Financial assets The majority of the Groups financial assets are equity shares and other investments which neither pay interest nor have a stated maturity date.
