This resulted in an adjustment for deferred tax in respect of previous years of 9.5 million, and increased the current deferred tax charge by net 6.8 million.
Legislation enacted at the same time as this tax increase also permitted companies to defer claims for 2005 Capital Allowances to 2006, to partially mitigate the effect of the tax increase.
The Group made such an election and this resulted in an adjustment for the previous year current tax charge of 6.2 million, but enabled the Group to reduce the Current UK corporation tax charge by 7.7 million, to the 1.1 million above.

Tax charges are calculated by applying the statutory tax rate in each tax jurisdiction to the accounting profit before tax for each entity.
The sum of the tax charges for each entity is then divided by the Group accounting profit before tax to derive the weighted average rate of corporation tax for the year.
The weighted average rate of corporation tax has changed from the previous accounting period due to differences in the weighted average mix of profits in each tax jurisdiction.
c Unrecognised tax losses The Group has unrecognised tax losses which arose in the UK of 2,044,000 2005: 81,000 in respect of outside the ring-fence activities, that are available indefinitely for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised as there is uncertainty whether the asset is recoverable.
The asset is recoverable if there were future suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
d Temporary differences associated with group investments At 31 December 2006, there was no recognised deferred tax liability 2005: Nil for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Groups subsidiaries as the Group has determined that undistributed profits of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the near future.
The temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries for which deferred tax has not been recognised aggregate to 1,026,000 2005: 985,000.
