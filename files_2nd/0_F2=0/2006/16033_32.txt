Option life used in the model has been based on options being exercised in accordance with historical patterns.
For executive share options the vesting period is 3 years.
If options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, these options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee 1 1 leaves the Group before options vest.
SAYE options vest after 3 or 5 years and expire 3 2 or 5 2 years after the date of grant.
The risk-free interest rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds on a term consistent with the vesting period.
Dividends used are based on actual dividends where data is known and future dividends estimated using a dividend cover of 3 times.
It has also been assumed that performance conditions in respect of the executive share options and the share matching scheme will be met.
