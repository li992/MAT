The current maximum award for each half-year amounts to 600,000 shares or a maximum annual award of 3,000 per employee if smaller.
For the 2006 financial year, a maximum of 916,328 shares 2005: 1,181,565 shares will vest under this scheme.
The awards are made with reference to the Groups performance against its budget.
Employees must remain in employment until the vesting date three years from the date of award, otherwise the shares will be forfeited.
The fair value of shares awarded is either the share price at the date of award, or is estimated at the latest share price available when drawing up the financial statements for awards not yet made and later adjusted to reflect the actual share price on the award date.
Awards under the SIP are entitled to receive dividends, and hence no adjustment has been made to this fair value.
ii The Unapproved Free Share Scheme the UFSS This scheme is open to managers and exceptional performers within the Group Henry Engelhardt and David Stevens have elected not to participate with variable awards available.
Under the scheme, individuals receive an award of free shares at no charge.
A total of 380 employees received awards under this scheme during 2006.
Staff must remain in employment until the vesting date in order for the shares to vest.
The maximum number of shares that can vest relating to the 2006 scheme is 681,375.
In the 2005 scheme, for an award to vest, the total shareholder return TSR of Admiral Group plc shares over the three years 2005 to 2007 must be at least equal to the TSR of the FTSE 350 index, of which the Company is a constituent.
If the Companys TSR does not meet this target, no awards will vest under the 2005 UFSS scheme.
This initial hurdle has been removed for the 2006 scheme.
Individual awards are calculated based on the growth in the Companys earnings per share EPS relative to a risk free return RFR, for which LIBOR has been selected as a benchmark.
This performance is measured over the same three-year period.
A D M I R A L G R O U P p l c 8 7 The range of awards is as follows: If the growth in EPS is less than the RFR, no awards vest EPS growth is equal to RFR 10% of maximum award vests To achieve the maximum award, EPS growth has to be 36 points higher than RFR over the three year period Between 10% and 100% of the maximum awards, a linear relationship exists.
Awards under the UFSS are not eligible for dividends and hence the fair value of free shares to be awarded under this scheme has been revised downwards to take account of these distributions.
The unadjusted fair value is based on the share price at the date on which awards were made being 3.62 for the 2005 scheme and 6.71 for the 2006 scheme.
