INTANGIBLE FIXED ASSETS continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued Cash-generating units containing goodwill are subject to impairment reviews.
The net present value of the future cash flows of cash-generating units is reviewed in order to determine whether an impairment provision is required.
The recoverable amount of acquired cash generating units is based on value in use calculations.
Those calculations use cash flow projections based on actual opening results and budgets approved by management covering a five-year period.
Due to the businesses acquired being of a long-term nature, cash flows beyond the five-year period have been extrapolated at a prudent flat growth rate.
A pre-tax discount rate of ten per cent has been used in discounting the projected cash flows.
Management believe that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
There were no impairments of goodwill during the year 2005: nil.
