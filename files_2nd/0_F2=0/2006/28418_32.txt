The Group has presented the income statement and balance sheet for banking operations in a format that demonstrates the characteristics A and principal operations specific to a bank.
The format is different from that of the Group consolidated income statement and balance sheet: however, total loss profit for the year and net assets remain the same.
To understand how the amounts presented from banking operations are consolidated in the Group financial statements, refer to the primary segmental information for the income statement in note F1 and the primary segmental information for the balance sheet in note B5.

Through its normal operations, Egg is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are credit, operational, liquidity, market and currency risk.
The overall responsibility for risk management and the risk appetite of Egg is set by the Egg Board and responsibility for managing these risks resides with the Egg Executive Committee.
The exposure to specific risks is monitored by the Executive Committee through separate committees: the retail H credit committee is responsible for retail credit risk, the wholesale credit committee is responsible for wholesale credit risk, the operational risk committee is responsible for operational risk and the asset and liability committee ALCO is responsible for liquidity, market and currency risk.
Egg uses financial instruments including derivatives for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities and I to reduce and eliminate the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Surplus retail and wholesale liabilities are invested in debt securities, including certificates of deposits, government gilts and other high investment grade assets.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 177 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued E4: Maturities of assets and liabilities and liquidity risk Liquidity risk is defined for Egg as not having sufficient financial resources available to meet its obligations as they fall due or if such resources can only be secured at excessive cost.
Egg uses various methods including predictions of daily cash positions to monitor and manage liquidity risk.
Maturity mismatches between lending and funding are managed within internal risk policy limits.
It ensures that it holds sufficient assets, which are immediately realisable into cash without significant exposure to market risk or costs, to cover a realistic A estimate of retail funds that could be withdrawn.
While a significant proportion of retail savings balances are on instant access terms, in practice the majority of such funds represent a relatively stable and consistent funding base for Egg.
The matching and controlled mismatching of the maturities and interest rates of assets and liabilities is fundamental to the management of a bank.
It is unusual for banks ever to be completely matched since business transacted is often of uncertain terms and of different types.
B The following table analyses the assets and liabilities of Egg into relevant maturity groupings based on the remaining period at the balance sheet date to the contractual maturity date.

The aggregate loss on loans at the end of the year and the charge during the year have been included in the consolidated financial statements.

Interest rate risk arises in Egg as a result of fixed rate, variable rate and non-interest bearing assets and liabilities.
Exposure to interest rate movements arises when there is a mismatch between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities.
D The composition of interest rate risk is closely monitored and managed on a day-to-day basis by the treasury function where professional expertise and systems exist to control it.
This is primarily done via asset and liability models that look at the sensitivity of earnings to movements in interest rates to measure overall exposure which may then be hedged in accordance with the policy limits set by the ALCO.
For the purpose of reducing interest rate risk, Egg uses a number of derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and forward rate E agreements see note G3.
Financial assets and liabilities not held at fair value through profit and loss and the weighted average effective interest rate for those balances are provided below: 2006 2005 m m F Assets Debt securities available-for-sale 1,935 5.3% 2,046 4.6% Loans and receivables 7,096 9.0% 8,148 7.5% 9,031 10,194 G Liabilities Banking customer accounts 5,554 4.9% 5,830 4.3% Core structural borrowings of shareholder-financed operations 451 6.2% 451 8.5% Operational borrowings attributable to shareholder-financed operations 2,819 5.4% 3,856 4.5% H 8,824 10,137 Egg has also classified 41 million 2005: 71 million of debt securities as fair value through profit and loss.
See note G2 for further information on interest rate risk.
I Currency risk The risks arising from assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are managed by a separate treasury function within Egg and within agreed limits set by the ALCO.
During the year, cash flows generated by the foreign currency assets and liabilities are hedged by using derivative contracts to manage exposure to exchange rate fluctuations.
At 31 December 2006, Egg held 357 million of assets and 1,751 million of liabilities with foreign currency exposure 2005: 539 million and 2,640 million respectively.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 179 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued E7: Credit risk Egg takes on exposure to credit risk, which is the risk that a counterparty will be unable to pay amounts in full when due.
To limit this risk, Egg places limits on the amount of risk accepted in relation to a particular borrower, groups of borrowers, and to particular geographical segments.
The acceptable risk levels are monitored regularly and reviewed where appropriate.
A The following table identifies the geographical concentrations of credit risk, stated in terms of total assets and off-balance sheet items, held by Egg at 31 December 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 m m UK 18,132 18,840 B Rest of Europe 244 399 Other 243 380 Total 18,619 19,619 This includes 9,475 million 2005: 9,104 million of off-balance sheet items, which mainly relate to unutilised credit limits on credit cards.
C The following is a breakdown of the credit risk borne by Egg for financial assets and off-balance sheet items at 31 December 2006 and 2005: 2006 2005 m m Loans and advances to banks 903 718 D Securities purchased under agreement to resell 200 Investment securities 1,970 2,117 Loans and advances to customers 6,711 7,765 Allowances for impairment losses on loans and advances to customers 518 335 Fair value of derivative assets 78 50 E Off-balance sheet items including unutilised credit limits on credit cards 9,475 9,104 Total credit risk net of allowances and provisions 18,619 19,619 At 31 December 2006, Egg had certain credit-related commitments in the form of unused credit limits on credit cards of 9,458 million 2005: 9,061 million and pre-approved but unused borrowing limits on mortgages and personal loans of 8 million and 9 million F respectively 2005: 14 million and 29 million respectively which are included in off-balance sheet items above.
Egg is potentially exposed to a loss totalling these amounts, but it is unlikely that such a loss would arise as these credit facilities were granted only on the basis of the customers having achieved certain credit standards.
Additionally, it is unlikely, should all these customers utilise their credit or borrowing limits, that all of them would default on their debt entirely.
G Egg holds significant concentrations of credit risk with other financial institutions.
At 31 December 2006, this was estimated at 8.7 billion 2005: 10.9 billion of which 3.9 billion 2005: 5.7 billion related to derivative financial instruments and 1.8 billion 2005: 2.3 billion to credit default swaps.
Egg also has significant credit exposure in asset-backed security products which totalled approximately 403 million at 31 December 2006 2005: 496 million.
With regard to loans and advances to customers, Egg has significant concentrations of credit H risk in respect of its unsecured lending on credit cards, personal loans and mortgage lending secured on property in the UK.
Assets pledged as collateral and securitisation Egg enters into securities lending arrangements, including repurchase agreements and over-the-counter derivative transactions as part of normal operating activities.
Assets are pledged as collateral to support these activities.
Collateral in respect of repurchase agreements was I nil and 5.2 million at 31 December 2006 and 2005, respectively.
Collateral in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions was 29.3 million and 30.9 million at 31 December 2006 and 2005, respectively.
See note G4 where amounts relating to Egg have been included in the disclosure of these transactions on a Group basis.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 183 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued F5: Tax continued b Reconciliation of effective tax rate The total tax expense is attributable to shareholders and policyholders as summarised in the income statement.
i Summary of pre-tax profit and tax charge A The income statement includes the following items: 2006 2005 m m Profit before tax 2,071 2,145 Tax attributable to policyholders returns 849 1,147 B Profit before tax attributable to shareholders 1,222 998 Tax attributable to shareholders profits: Tax expense 1,196 1,388 Less: tax attributable to policyholders returns 849 1,147 C Tax attributable to shareholders profits 347 241 Profit from continuing operations after tax 875 757 ii Overview For the purposes of explaining the relationship between tax expense and accounting profit, it is appropriate to consider the sources of D profit and tax by reference to those that are attributable to shareholders and policyholders, as follows: 2006 2005 Attributable to Attributable to Attributable to Attributable to shareholders policyholders Total shareholders policyholders Total m m m m m m E Profit before tax 1,222 849 2,071 998 1,147 2,145 Taxation charge: Expected tax rate 31% 100% 59% 35% 100% 70% Expected tax charge 374 849 1,223 353 1,147 1,500 F Variance from expected tax charge note v ii 27 27 112 112 Actual tax charge 347 849 1,196 241 1,147 1,388 Average effective tax rate 28% 100% 58% 24% 100% 65% For the column entitled Attributable to policyholders, the profit before tax represents income, net of post-tax transfers to unallocated surplus of with-profits funds, before tax G attributable to policyholders and unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and unit-linked policies.
Due to the requirements of the financial reporting standards IAS 1 and IAS 12, the profit before tax and tax charge reflect the aggregate of amounts that are attributable to shareholders and policyholders.
Profit before tax comprises profit attributable to shareholders and pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders of linked and with-profits H funds and unallocated surplus of with-profits funds.
The total tax charge for linked and with-profits business includes tax expense on unit-linked and with-profits funds attributable to policyholders, the unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and the shareholders profits.
This feature arises from the basis of taxation applied to life and pension business, principally in the UK, but with similar bases applying in certain Asian operations, and is explained I in note iii below.
Furthermore, the basis of preparation of Prudentials financial statements incorporates the additional feature that, as permitted under IFRS 4, the residual equity of the Groups with-profits funds, i. e. unallocated surplus, is recorded as a liability with transfers to and from that liability reflected in pre-tax profits.
This gives rise to anomalous effective tax rates for profits attributable to policyholders as described in note iv below.
In meeting the reconciliation requirements set out in paragraph 81 c of IAS 12, the presentation shown in this disclosure note seeks to ensure that the explanation of the relationship between tax expense and accounting profit draw properly the distinction between the elements of the profit and tax charge that are attributable to policyholders and shareholders as explained below in notes iv and v, respectively.
The shareholder elements are the components of the profit and tax charge that are of most direct relevance to investors, and it is this aspect that the IAS 12 requirement is seeking to explain for companies that do not need to account for both with-profits and unit-linked funds, where tax is borne by the Company on the policyholders behalf and which is not contemplated by IFRS requirements.
184 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements F5: Tax continued iii Basis of taxation for UK life and pension business Different rules apply under UK tax law for taxing pension business and life insurance business and there are detailed rules for apportioning the investment return and profits of the fund between the types of business.
A The investment return referrable to pension business, and some other less significant classes of business, is exempt from taxation, but tax is charged on the profit that shareholders derive from writing such business at the corporate rate of tax.
The rules for taxing life insurance business are more complex.
Initially, the UK regime seeks to tax the regulatory basis investment return less management expenses I-E on this business as it arises.
However, in determining the actual tax charge, a calculation of the shareholder profits for taxation purposes from writing life insurance business also has to be made and compared with the I-E profit.
B If the shareholder profit is higher than the I-E amount, then relief for expenses in the I-E calculation has to be restricted until the I-E profit equals the shareholder profit.
If on the other hand, the I-E profit is the greater, then an amount equal to the shareholder profit is taxed at the corporate rate of tax, with the remainder of the I-E profit being taxed at the lower policyholder rate of tax.
The purpose of this approach is to ensure that the Company is always as a minimum taxed on the profit, as defined for taxation purposes C by reference to the Companys regulatory returns rather than IFRS basis results, that it has earned.
The shareholders portion of the long-term business is taxed at the shareholders rate, with the remaining portion taxed at rates applicable to the policyholders.
It is to be noted that the calculations described are determined using data from the regulatory basis returns rather than the IFRS basis results.
The differences between the regulatory and accounting bases are significant and complex.
D iv Profits attributable to policyholders and related tax As noted above, it is necessary under IFRS requirements to include the total tax charge of the Company both policyholder and shareholder elements in the tax charge disclosed in the income statement.
E For with-profits business, total pre-tax profits reflect the aggregate of profits attributable to policyholders and shareholders.
However, amounts attributable to the equity of with-profits funds are carried in the liability for unallocated surplus.
Also, as described in note iii, UK with-profits business is taxed on a basis that affects policyholders unallocated surplus of with-profits funds and shareholders.
For the PAC with-profits sub-fund, transfers to and from unallocated surplus are recorded in the income statement, so that after charging the total tax borne by the fund, the net balance reflects the statutory transfer from the fund for the year.
The statutory transfer represents 10 per cent F of the actuarially determined surplus for the year that is attributable to shareholders.
For SAIF similar transfers are made.
However, in the case of SAIF, a net nil balance is derived, reflecting the lack of shareholder interest in the financial performance of the fund other than through investment management arrangements.
The accounting anomaly that arises under IFRS is that due to the fact that the net of tax profit attributable to with-profits policyholders G is zero, the Companys presentation of pre-tax profit attributable to policyholders reflects an amount that is the mirror image of the tax charge attributable to policyholders.
For unit-linked business, pre-tax profits also reflect the aggregate of profits attributable to policyholders and shareholders.
The pre-tax profits attributable to policyholders represent fees earned that are used to pay tax borne by the Company on policyholders behalf.
H The net of tax profit attributable to policyholders for unit-linked business is thus zero.
The combined effect of these features is such that providing a reconciliation of the tax charge attributable to policyholders to an expected charge based on the standard corporate rate of tax on IFRS basis profits attributable to policyholders is not relevant.
I In summary, for accounting purposes, in all cases and for all reporting periods, the apparent effective rate for profit attributable to policyholders and unallocated surplus is 100 per cent.
However, it is to be noted that the 100 per cent rate does not reflect a rate paid on the profits attributable to policyholders.
It instead reflects the basis of accounting for unallocated surplus coupled with the distinction made for performance reporting between sources of profit attributable to shareholders, policyholders and unallocated surplus and IFRS requirements in respect of reporting of all pre-tax profits and all tax charges irrespective of policyholder or shareholder economic interest.

For Asian operations the expected tax rates reflect the corporate tax rate weighted by reference to the source of profits of the operations contributing to the aggregate business result.
In 2005, the expected tax rate on total profits of 35 per cent was due to the inclusion of a goodwill impairment charge of 120 million which is not allowable for tax.
In 2006, no goodwill impairment charge has been booked, and the expected tax rate on total profits of 31 per cent is lower in part due to this, and additionally due to the Asian long-term business which is subject to lower tax rates than the UK and US being a greater proportion of Group results.
Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 187 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued F5: Tax continued Notes continued ii Variances from expected tax charge for results attributable to shareholders For 2006, the principal variances arise from differences between the standard corporation tax rate and actual rates due to a number of factors, including: a The tax credit arising from relief for excess expenses in respect of the shareholder-backed protection business.
A b Prior year adjustments arising from routine revisions of tax returns.
For 2005, the principal variances arise from differences between the standard corporation tax rate and actual rates for other operations.
This is due to a number of factors including: a The settlement of outstanding issues with HM Revenue and Customs HMRC at amounts below those previously provided.
The settlements related to a range of issues affecting both shareholder and policyholder taxes.
Many of the issues had been in dispute for several years.
The principal issues resolved were as follows: Firstly, HMRC had disputed the deductibility of commissions paid on credit life protection insurance.
Prudentials treatment of the commissions was consistent with industry B practice.
At the start of 2005 it looked likely that the dispute would only be settled through litigation.
However, it proved possible to negotiate a settlement acceptable to both parties.
Secondly, in 2000 Prudential transferred the insurance business previously carried on by two M&G subsidiaries into another subsidiary, Scottish Amicable Life SAL.
In 2002, Prudential transferred the entire business of SAL including the old M&G business into Prudential Assurance Company Limited.
Both of these transactions were conducted under a statutory framework, which included obtaining High Court approval.
The transactions were complex, leading to a difference in views between HMRC and Prudential as to the correct tax treatment of the transactions.
These differences were resolved through a negotiated settlement.
C b The tax credit arising from relief for excess expenses in respect of the shareholder-backed protection business.
c Prior year adjustments arising from routine revisions of tax returns.
d The benefit from Eggs previously unused French losses.
iii For 2006, operating profit based on longer-term investment returns is net of attributable restructuring costs and development expenses.
In 2005, operating profit based D on longer-term investment returns is net of development expenses.
