Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The financial statements of FKI plc are presented as required by the Companies Act 1985.
As permitted by the Act, the separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Standards UK GAAP using the historical cost convention, except for in the year ended 31 March 2006 where certain financial instruments have been measured at fair value.
As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the profit and loss account is not presented.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the cash flows of the Company are included within the published consolidated financial statements.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items considered material in relation to the financial statements, except as noted below.
In these financial statements the following new standards have been adopted for the first time: FRS 20:Share based payments FRS 21:Events after the balance sheet date FRS 23:The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS 25:Financial Instruments : presentation and disclosure FRS 26:Financial Instruments : measurement The accounting policies under these new standards are set out below.
The effects of adopting these new standards are set out in note 10.
The comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
As permitted, FRS 25 and FRS 26 have been adopted from 1 April 2005 with no restatement of comparative figures.
Foreign currency translation Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date.
All profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Tangible fixed assets Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and provision for any impairment in value.
Depreciation is calculated on all assets, other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: Plant and machinery heavy production 15 years other 10 years Office equipment 5 to 10 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds, less costs of disposal, and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
124 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Leases Assets obtained under leases and hire purchase contracts which result in the transfer to the Company of substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership finance leases are capitalised as tangible fixed assets at the estimated present value of underlying lease payments and are depreciated over their expected useful lives.
The capital elements of future lease obligations are recorded as liabilities whilst the finance elements of the rental payments are charged to the income statement over the period of the lease or hire purchase contract so as to produce a constant rate of charge on the outstanding balance of the net obligation in each period.
Rentals paid under other leases operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Investments The Companys investment in shares in Group companies are stated at cost less provision for impairment.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid, or recovered, using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised, using the liability method, on all temporary differences, subject to the exceptions noted below, at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax in respect of taxable or deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries is not recognised where the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future or in the case of assets, taxable profit will be unavailable against which the temporary differences, can be utilised.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and carried forward unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which it is anticipated that the asset will be realised or the liability will be settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders funds Dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
125 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Pensions and other post-retirement benefits i Defined contribution pension schemes Pension costs for the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are recognised within operating profit at an amount equal to the contributions payable to the scheme for the period.
Any prepaid or outstanding contributions at the balance sheet date are recognised respectively as assets or liabilities within prepayments or accruals.
ii Defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits Pension liabilities are measured at their present value in accordance with actuarial assumptions that are updated at each balance sheet date.
Pension assets are measured at fair value.
The pension liability or asset is recognised in the balance sheet.
Pension costs for the Companys defined benefit pension schemes and other post-retirement benefits are recognised as follows: a Within operating profit The current service cost arising from employee service in the current period: The prior service cost related to employee service in prior periods arising in the current period as a result of improvements to benefits: Gains and losses arising on unanticipated settlements or curtailments where the item that gave rise to the settlement or curtailment is recognised within operating profit.
b Within other finance cost or income The interest cost on the liabilities, calculated by reference to the scheme liabilities and discount rate at the beginning of the period.
The expected return on assets, calculated by reference to the assets and their long-term expected rate of return at the beginning of the period.
c Within the statement of recognised income and expense On the scheme assets the difference between the expected and actual return on assets: On the scheme liabilities a the differences between the actuarial assumptions and actual experience, and b the effect of changes in actuarial assumptions.
Derivative financial instruments of hedge accounting i Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2005 As permitted, FRS 25 and FRS 26 have been adopted from 1 April 2005 with no restatement of comparative figures.
Derivatives for hedging purposes are held off balance sheet with the exception of cross-currency swaps, where the net exchange gain loss as a result of exchange rate movements is recorded on the balance sheet to reflect the substance of the transaction.
The net interest cost income arising on interest rate swaps is charged credited to the interest line in the profit and loss account on an accruals basis.
Monetary discounts or premiums arising on the disposal or other early termination of interest rate swaps are amortised on a straight-line basis over the original unexpired life of the swap against interest charges in the profit and loss account.
126 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued Finance costs are recognised in the income statement over the term of the instruments to which they relate at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs.
The carrying amount is increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by the payments made in the period.
ii Policy applicable for the year to 31 March 2006 The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financial and investment activities.
The Company does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
As the Company accounts for its investments in subsidiaries and associates at cost in its separate books, certain derivative instruments could not be designated as the hedging instrument in a net investment hedge in the Company accounts.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition they are stated at fair value.
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as either fair value hedges, where they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability: or cash flow hedges, where they hedge exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecasted transaction.
In relation to fair value hedges eg: interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Any gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item and recognised in the income statement.
Where the adjustment is to the carrying amount of a hedged interest-bearing financial instrument, the adjustment is amortised to the net profit and loss such that it is fully amortised by maturity.
In relation to cash flow hedges eg: forward foreign currency contracts including cross-currency swap contracts to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
When the hedged firm commitment results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the acquisition cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability.
For cash flow hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same year in which the hedged firm commitment affects the net profit and loss, for example when the future sale actually occurs.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is kept in equity until the forecasted transaction occurs.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the year.
Share-based payments Certain employees including directors receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined by an external valuation.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of FKI plc market conditions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards at that date based on the best available estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
127 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The Company has an employee share incentive plan and an employee share trust for the granting of non-transferable options to executives and senior employees.
Shares in the Company held by the employee share trust are presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied FRS 20 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 April 2004.

Financial instruments The Company adopted FRS 26:Financial Instruments: recognition and measurement and FRS 25:Financial Instruments: presentation and disclosure from 1 April 2005.
The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, financial and investment activities.
Under FRS 26, financial instruments are recognised initially at cost and subsequent to initial recognition are stated at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to the present value of the estimated future cash flow.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately in the income statement.
135 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 11.
Financial instruments continued In relation to cash flow hedges, to hedge firm commitments which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly to equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in net profit or loss.
Further details of the accounting treatment adopted are included within the Company accounting policies.
The impact on the balance sheet at 1 April 2005 of adopting FRS 26 and FRS 25 is as follows: m m Increase in derivative financial assets 64.5 Increase in derivative financial liabilities 6.6 Increase in loans and borrowings 98.2 40.3 Decrease in creditors 35.3 Equity movements: Retained earnings 5.4 Hedging reserve 0.4 5.0 12.
Prior year adjustments The adoption of FRS 20 resulted in an increase in staff costs as FRS 20 requires that an expense be recognised in the income statement for all share-based payments.
The accounting policy provides more background information.
FRS 21 requires that dividends unpaid at the balance sheet date are only recognised as a liability at that date to the extent that they are appropriately authorised and are no longer at the discretion of the Company.
Therefore, the final proposed dividend each year is not recognised as a liability and only included in equity after approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Dividends The amounts recognised as distributions to equity holders in the year were: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005 of 3p 2004: 3p per ordinary share 17.5 17.5 Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2006 of 1.5p 2005 : 1.5p per ordinary share 8.8 8.7 26.3 26.2 The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and in accordance with FRS 21 has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2006.
This proposed final dividend will be paid on 6 October 2006 to ordinary shareholders on the register at 8 September 2006.
Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2006 of 3p 2005 : 3p per ordinary share 17.5 17.5 136 FKI plc Notes to the Company financial statements 14.
Directors remuneration The directors are remunerated by FKI plc for their services to the Group as a whole.
Information covering directors remuneration is given in the Remuneration Report of the Group.
Contingent liabilities The Company has contingent liabilities of 16.7 million 2005: 41.8 million in respect of guarantees of subsidiary undertakings banking obligations.
In addition, the Company has guaranteed 100.0 million 2005: 98.1 million of US dollar fixed rate guaranteed senior notes issued on behalf of FKI Industries Inc.
The Company is also the subject of various pending legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business, including claims on contracts, product liability, environmental claims and others.
The claims giving rise to such proceedings are likely to be mitigated by legal defences, insurance and third party indemnities.
While the outcome of some of these matters cannot precisely be foreseen, the directors do not believe that these claims, after allowing for provisions already made, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys financial results.
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its group, the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that the Company will be required to make payments under the guarantee.
Leasing commitments The total future minimum rental payable under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: Year ended Year ended 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Not later than one year 0.1 0.1 After one year but not more than five years 0.4 0.4 After five years 0.5 0.5 17.
Other information a The loss on ordinary activities after taxation is 78.0 million 2005: loss of 35.9 million.
b Auditors remuneration for the statutory audit is 38,000 2005: 35,000. c Operating lease rentals charged to the profit and loss account is 0.1 million 2005: 0.2 million.
