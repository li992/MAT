notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies IMI plc the Company is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
The consolidated financial statements of the Company comprise the Company and its subsidiaries together referred to as the Group.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU and applicable law IFRS.
The financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 5 March 2007.
The following standards and IFRICs were issued and endorsed by the EU but are not effective for the year ended 31 December 2006.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures application date 1 January 2007.
Amendment to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures application date 1 January 2007.
IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 application date 1 May 2006.
The application of IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standards are concerned with disclosure only.
The application of IFRIC 8 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement.
a Basis of accounting The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the Companys functional currency, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair value: pension plan assets, derivative financial instruments, and assets and liabilities identified as hedged items.
Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale, where applicable, are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
The accounting policies have been applied consistently throughout the Group for the purposes of these consolidated financial statements.
b Use of estimates and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised and in any future periods affected.
The nature of the markets in which the Group operates leads, from time to time, to a variety of possible legal and other claims from customers.
Whenever such matters are notified to the Group, they are investigated and any liability which results is recognised in the accounts as soon as a reliable estimate can be made.
The Company has disposed of a number of its previous businesses.
The sale agreements contained various warranties and indemnities.
In some cases, the agreements also include the potential for adjustment to the purchase price, sometimes contingent on future events.
At the time of disposal, the accounts reflect the best estimate of the likely future impact of these agreements.
Estimates are updated at each reporting date to reflect the latest information available.
Information about other areas of estimation, uncertainty and critical judgements in applying accounting policies that have the most significant effect on the amount recognised in the financial statements are described in the notes which follow.
c Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are those entities which the Company has the power to control.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
ii Transactions eliminated on consolidation Intragroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised gains arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
d Foreign currencies i Foreign currency transactions Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies have been translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translating transactions at the exchange rate ruling on the transaction date are reflected in profit before taxation in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair values were determined.
56 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 ii Foreign operations The income statements of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the appropriate average rate of exchange for the year and the adjustment to year end rates is taken directly to reserves.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly as a separate component of equity.
Since 1 January 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, such differences have been recognised in the translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, in part or in full, the relevant amount in the translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss.
e Financial instruments and fair value hedging Financial instruments are recorded initially at fair value.
Subsequent measurement depends on the designation of the instrument, which follows the categories in IAS 39: Fixed deposits, comprising principally funds held with banks and other financial institutions, and short term borrowings and overdrafts are classified as loans and receivables under IAS 39, and held at amortised cost after impairment losses.
Derivatives, comprising interest rate swaps, foreign exchange contracts and options, metals futures contracts and any embedded derivatives, are classified as held for trading under IAS 39, unless designated as hedges.
Long term loans are generally held at amortised cost.
Where the long term loan is hedged, generally by an interest rate swap, and the hedge is regarded as effective, the carrying value of the long term loan is adjusted for changes in fair value of the risk being hedged.
Trade receivables are stated at their amortised cost as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Trade payables are stated at amortised cost.
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the balance sheet only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
f Other hedging i Hedge of monetary assets and liabilities Where a derivative financial instrument is used to economically hedge the foreign exchange exposure of a recognised monetary asset or liability, no hedge accounting is applied and any gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement.
ii Hedge of net investment in foreign operation Where a foreign currency liability or derivative financial instrument is in a formally designated hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation, foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the foreign currency liability or derivative financial instrument are recognised directly in equity to the extent the hedge is effective.
The Company assesses the hedge effectiveness of its net investment hedges based on fair value changes of its net assets and the fair value changes of debt designated as hedging instruments.
g Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill arising on acquisitions from 1 January 2004 is recognised as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
The asset recognised is measured as the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired and associated costs.
On an ongoing basis the goodwill is measured at cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Fair value adjustments are always considered to be provisional at the first balance sheet date after acquisition to allow the maximum time to elapse for management to make a reliable estimate.
Goodwill on acquisitions prior to 1 January 1998 was deducted from reserves in the year of acquisition.
In accordance with IFRS3 Business Combinations such goodwill continues as a deduction from reserves and is not recognised in the income statement in the event of disposal of the cash-generating unit to which it relates.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions after 1 January 1998 was previously capitalised as an intangible asset and amortised on a straight-line basis over a maximum 20 years.
The un-amortised goodwill under UK GAAP at 31 December 2003 became the opening goodwill under the Groups transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004.
57 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued g Intangible assets ii Research and development Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products and processes, is capitalised provided benefits are probable, cost can be reliably measured and if, and only if, the product or process is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient resources to complete development.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and directly attributable overheads.
Other development expenditure is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
iii Other intangible assets Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group as part of a business combination are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy on Impairment.
Cost reflects managements prudent judgement of the fair value of the individual intangible asset calculated by reference to the net present value of future benefits accruing to the Group from utilisation of the asset, discounted at an appropriate discount rate.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Amortisation of intangible assets other than goodwill Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis unless such a basis is not aligned with the anticipated benefit over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets.
Amortisation commences from the date the intangible asset becomes available for use.
The estimated maximum useful lives are as follows: Capitalised development costs 5 years Customer relationships Life of the intangible asset up to 10 years Other intangible assets Life of the intangible asset up to 10 years h Property, plant and equipment Freehold land and assets in the course of construction are not depreciated.
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation see below and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis unless such a basis is not aligned with the anticipated benefit so as to write down the cost of assets to residual values over the period of their estimated useful lives within the following ranges: Freehold buildings 25 to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings Period of lease Plant and machinery 3 to 20 years i Leased assets Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Plant and equipment acquired by way of finance lease is stated at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation see above and impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense.
The majority of leasing transactions entered into by the Group are operating leases.
j Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment losses see accounting policy Impairment.
k Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
In respect of work in progress and finished goods, cost includes all direct costs of production and the appropriate proportion of production overheads.
58 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
m Impairment The carrying values of the Groups non-financial assets other than inventories see accounting policy Inventories and deferred tax assets see accounting policy Income tax, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset or all assets within its cash-generating unit is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
i Calculation of recoverable amount The recoverable amount of the Groups receivables is calculated as the present value of expected future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate inherent in the asset.
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.
The recoverable amount of other assets is the greater of their fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows generated based upon the latest Group three year plan and prudently extrapolated using an appropriate long-term growth rate in perpetuity consistent with GDP growth are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
Management believe that this approach is appropriate based upon historical experience.
For an asset that does not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
ii Reversals of impairment As required by IAS36: Impairment of Assets, any impairment of goodwill is non-reversible.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if at the balance sheet date there are indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists following a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.
n Dividends Dividends are recognised as a liability in the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
o Employee benefits i Defined contribution pension plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred.
ii Defined benefit pension plans The Groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and any unrecognised past service costs and the fair value of any plan assets are deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at balance sheet date on high quality bonds of the appropriate currency that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognised asset is limited to the net total of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past service by employees is recognised in profit or loss in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the average period until the benefits become vested.
To the extent that the benefits vest immediately, the expense is recognised immediately in profit or loss in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in equity and disclosed in the statement of recognised income and expense.
59 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 notes to the financial statements 1.
Significant accounting policies continued o Employee benefits continued iii Long-term service benefits The Groups net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.
The obligation is calculated using the projected unit credit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any related assets is deducted.
The discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on high quality bonds of the appropriate currency that have maturity dates approximating the terms of the Groups obligations.
iv Equity and equity-related compensation benefits The Group operates an Executive Share Option Scheme, a SAYE Share Option Scheme, an All Employee Share Ownership Plan and a Performance Share Plan.
For options granted on or after 7 November 2002, the fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense each year.
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions for example, profitability and sales growth targets.
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.
The fair value of the options is determined based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to vest.
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
p Provisions Provisions are recognised when: the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events: it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation: and the amount can be reliably estimated.
Provisions are valued at managements best estimate of the amount required to settle the present obligation at the balance sheet date.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly.
q Trade and other payables Trade and other payables are stated at their cost.
r Revenue Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer and reliable measurement is possible.
No revenue is recognised where recovery of the consideration is not probable or there are significant uncertainties regarding associated costs, or the possible return of goods.
s Financial income and expense Financial income comprises interest receivable on funds invested, assumed returns on employee benefit plan assets and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield on the asset.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date that the dividend is declared.
Financial expense comprises interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest rate method, assumed interest on employee benefit plan liabilities and losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement.
The interest expense component of finance lease payments is recognised in the income statement using the effective interest rate method.
60 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 t Income tax Current tax represents the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date, and taking into account any adjustments in respect of prior years.
Deferred tax is provided, using the balance sheet method, on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
Deferred tax is not recognised for the following temporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that the timing of the reversal of the differences can be controlled and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse, based on the tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.
u Non-current assets held for sale and discontinued operations Where applicable, on initial classification as held for sale, non-current disposal groups are recognised at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
Impairment losses on the initial classification of assets as held for sale are included in profit or loss, even for assets measured at fair value, as are gains and losses on subsequent re-measurement.
A discontinued operation is a component of the Groups business that represents a separate major line of business that has been disposed of, is held for sale or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to re-sale.
Classification as a discontinued operation occurs upon disposal or when the operation meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, if earlier.
Restatement 2005 comparative figures have been restated where appropriate to exclude and separately identify restructuring costs, to show financial income and expense related to defined benefit pension schemes gross, to show loss from discontinued operations net of tax and the equivalent in the cash flow as single line items, and to include goodwill within segment assets.
3. Business and geographical segments Segmental information is presented in the consolidated financial statements in respect of the Group's continuing business segments, which are the primary basis of segment reporting.
The business segment reporting format reflects the Group's management and internal reporting structures.
Geographical location is the secondary basis of segment reporting.
The Group is comprised of the following main business segments and activities: Fluid Controls Severe Service Design, manufacture, supply and service of high performance critical control valves and associated equipment for power generation plants, oil & gas producers and other process industries.
Fluid Power Design, manufacture and supply of motion and fluid control systems, principally pneumatic devices, for original equipment manufacturers in commercial vehicle, medical, print, packaging and other industries.

Acquisitions The only material acquisition completed in the period was of the whole share capital of Truflo, a leading specialist in valves and related flow control products, acquired in April 2006 and reported within Severe Service and Fluid Power.
Of the reported increase in revenue and operating profit of continuing operations before restructuring costs and intangible amortisation, 62m and 11.2m respectively result from the Truflo acquisition.
The extra months of the prior year acquisitions of Syron Engineering & Manufacturing and GT Development Corporation Fluid Power, the ABB KK Control Valve business Severe Service and Northern Parts & Service Beverage Dispense contributed 58m and 6.5m revenue and operating profit respectively.
Assuming the Truflo acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2006, the Group revenue and operating profit would have been higher by 19m and 3m respectively.

Discontinued operations There were no businesses discontinued during 2006.
In September 2006, the European Commission announced the imposition of a fine of 48.3m on IMI in relation to its former copper fittings business, which was sold in 2002.
Pending the outcome of an appeal, the full amount of the fine together with associated costs has been provided and is reported in the income statement as a loss on discontinued operations net of tax.
The fine was paid in January 2007.
The 2005 loss on discontinued operations net of tax comprises the after tax trading result of the Polypipe Group Building Products segment together with the loss on its disposal in September 2005, plus closure costs of its Doors & Windows business which was closed prior to sale.

Financial instruments Foreign currency The Groups policies in relation to foreign exchange, interest rate and credit risk are outlined in the Directors Report on pages 32 and 33.
Interest rate risk management The Group has raised US dollar debt through the issuance of medium to long term fixed rate loan notes.
In order to manage its exposure to interest rates by maintaining a balanced exposure between fixed and floating rates, US$ 95m of this fixed rate exposure was hedged back to floating through the use of interest rate swaps in 1999 and 2001 covering loan notes with maturities between 2009 and 2014.
The interest component of the fair value of this portion of the loan notes has been designated as a hedged item and has been revalued accordingly in the accounts.
The fair value of these interest rate swaps is included in the balance sheet at 2.7m 2005: 4.7m.
The hedged item is included in the value of the debt as an increase in liability of 2.7m 2005: increase 5.2m.
Exposure to other interest rate volatility is managed through a combination of fixed rate debt and derivative instruments where appropriate.
Net investment hedges The Group hedges its net investments in overseas operations by way of external currency loans and currency forward contracts.
The intention is to minimise the Group's exposure to gains and losses in Group equity resulting from retranslation of currency net assets at balance sheet dates.
To the extent that an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation is determined to be an effective hedge, the gain or loss arising is recognised directly in reserves.
The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Floating rate liabilities comprise short term debt which bears interest at short term bank rates and the liability side of exchange contracts where the interest element is based primarily on three month inter bank rate.
All cash surpluses are invested for short periods and can be considered as floating rate investments.
Short term trade debtors and creditors have been excluded from the above two analyses.
There are no other material non-interest bearing financial assets or liabilities.

The IMI Pension Fund constitutes around 90% of the total pension liabilities as at 31 December 2006.
The mortality assumptions used for the Fund reflect its experience, together with an allowance for future improvements over time.
The experience is next expected to be reviewed as part of the formal actuarial valuation as at 31 March 2008.
The table below shows the implied life expectancy from age 65 for the Fund's current and future pensioners based on the mortality assumptions adopted.
The figure for future pensioners is based on the average current employee.
No changes to these assumptions have been made during the year.

Share-based payments The Group operates the following share-based payment schemes: SAYE savings-related share option scheme This scheme is open to the majority of the Groups UK employees, including the executive directors, and allows the grant of options to all participants at a discount of up to 20% below the market price.
Such schemes are not subject to performance conditions and offer tax incentives to encourage employees to use their own money to purchase shares in the business.
SAYE options are exercisable within 6 months of the exercise date and otherwise expire.
Executive Share Option Scheme Executive share options were last awarded to executive directors in 2004 and to certain other employees in 2005.
All outstanding options granted under this scheme were granted subject to stretching performance conditions related to growth in earnings per share above inflation over a fixed period of three financial years.
Executive share options expire if not exercised or lapsed within the periods shown below.
Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP The last LTIP awards were made in 2005 as part of the transition to new long term incentive arrangements introduced in 2005.
The LTIP allows cash awards to executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group subject to certain performance conditions.
At the end of the performance period, the net of tax value of any LTIP payments must normally be invested in market purchases of the Company's ordinary shares pursuant to a deferred share plan.
Such share purchases are to be made through an employee trust and held for a further three year period.
After that period, matching shares are awarded of one additional share for every four with no further performance conditions.
Performance Share Plan PSP These are open to the executive directors and selected senior managers within the Group.
50% of these PSP shares vest subject to EPS growth, based on internal financial performance conditions.
Hence, for purposes of IFRS2, the fair value of the shares does not include any performance related discount.
The plan uses TSR total shareholder return as a performance condition for the other 50% of shares granted.
As TSR is a market based performance condition, the accounting treatment differs from that for shares subject to internal performance conditions.
This means that the TSR performance condition must be incorporated into the calculation of the fair value, that is, there is a TSR-related discount in calculating the fair value.
Deferred Bonus Plan DBP Under the DBP, for executive directors and selected senior managers a proportion of earned annual bonus will be mandatorily deferred for three years and delivered in shares in the Company.
Qualifying employees may also elect to voluntarily defer all or part of the remainder of their annual bonus.
Additional shares, in the form of a matching award, may be earned to a maximum of 100% of the deferred bonus at the entry share price level or 125% for the Chief Executive if stretching performance conditions are met by the Company over the three year deferral period.

82 IMI plc Annual Report 2006 The fair value of services received in return for share options granted are measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The assumptions used for grants in 2006 included a dividend yield of 3.5% 2005: 3.5%, expected share price volatility of 34% 2005: 34%, a weighted average expected life of 4.5 years 2005: 4.6 years and a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% 2005: 4.2%.
The expected volatility is wholly based on the historic volatility calculated based on the weighted average remaining life of the share options, adjusted for any expected changes to future volatility due to publicly available information.
The total expenses recognised for the period arising from share-based payments are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Equity settled share-based payment expense in employee cost in the income statement 2.9 2.0 22.

Trade warranties are given in the normal course of business and cover a range of periods, typically from 1-6 years.
Other provisions comprise mainly environmental provisions, recognising the Group's obligations to remediate contaminated land at a number of current and former sites.
Because of the long term nature of the liability, costs to be incurred and timescale are uncertain and the provision represent management's best estimate of these costs.
