PROFORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION To enable a more meaningful presentation of results, in addition to the statutory comparative information, the results for the year ended 30 September 2005 have been compiled on a proforma basis.
This shows the Group's customer loan balances, borrowings and interest income as they would have been shown had IAS 32 and 39 applied to these balances.
The remaining adjustments required by these standards relate to fair values and hedging and cannot be applied as the required documentation for these arrangements was not in place at 1 October 2004.
A reconciliation between the statutory comparatives and the proforma information was given in the announcement of 21 February 2006.
The differences in the segment results and segmental 'loans to customers' figures between the statutory and proforma bases are also detailed in the announcement.
