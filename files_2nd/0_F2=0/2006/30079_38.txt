Investments are all classified as held at fair value under IFRS and quoted equities are carried at bid prices which equates to their fair value.
They were carried at mid prices previously.
The resultant difference of 354,000 is included in retained earnings.
The present value of the future lease payments on long leases in the investment property portfolio has been included both in the valuation and as a creditor.
No provision has been made for the final dividend on ordinary shares for the year ended 31 March 2004 of 4,961,000 as this was not declared until after the balance sheet date.
Under IFRS the dividend is not recognised until approved or paid.
This is therefore added to retained earnings.
Under IFRS, there is no differentiation between capital and revenue gains losses.
The previous heading of Other reserves is now included under the heading Retained earnings.
Under IFRS, 1,347,000 of deferred taxation has been provided on potential capital gains on investment properties held in subsidiaries.
