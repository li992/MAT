NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS For the year ended 31 December 2006 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation Cairn prepares its accounts on a historical cost basis.
Where there are assets and liabilities calculated on a different basis, this fact is disclosed in the relevant accounting policy.
b Accounting standards Cairn prepares its accounts in accordance with applicable International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the EU.
The Groups financial statements are also consistent with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB.
Relevant new standards and interpretations issued by the IASB, but not yet effective and not applied in these financial statements, are as follows: Title Change to accounting policy Date of adoption by Cairn Impact on initial application Effective date from 1 May 2006 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share based payments under 1 Jan 2007 Increase in the Groups retained the phantom options scheme earnings brought forward will be accounted for in the as at 1 Jan 2007 same way as other share-based payment schemes Effective date from 1 January 2007 IFRS 7 Financial No changes to current 1 Jan 2007 Additional disclosures regarding Instruments: Disclosures accounting policy financial instruments and amendment to IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation Amendment to IAS 1 No changes to current 1 Jan 2007 Additional disclosures required Presentation of accounting policy concerning an entitys capital Financial Statements Capital Disclosures Effective date from 1 March 2007 IFRIC 11 Group and Share based payment awards 1 Jan 2008 Decrease in retained earnings Treasury Share Transactions relating to employees of of Cairn Energy PLC, with subsidiary will be recognised corresponding adjustment in the equity of that company in other debtors Effective date from 1 January 2009 IFRS 8 Operating No changes to current 1 Jan 2009 Alternative disclosures regarding Segments accounting policy segmental performance No other IFRS as issued by the IASB which are not yet effective, are expected to have an impact on the Groups financial statements.
During the year, Cairn adopted IFRIC 4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease and IFRIC 5 Rights to interests arising from decommissioning, restoration and environmental rehabilitation funds.
c Presentational currency The functional currency of Cairn Energy PLC, the ultimate parent company of the Group, is sterling.
These accounts have been presented in US dollars $, the functional currency of most companies within the Group.
It is deemed to be more appropriate to present the financial statements in line with the functional currency of the majority of the Group.
The Groups policy on foreign currencies is detailed in note 1 p. CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 75 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED d Basis of consolidation The consolidated accounts include the results of Cairn Energy PLC and its subsidiary undertakings to the Balance Sheet date.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed during the year are included in the Income Statement and Cash Flow Statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal as appropriate.
Cairn allocates the purchase consideration of any acquisition to assets and liabilities on the basis of fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the assets and liabilities is recognised as goodwill.
Any goodwill arising is recognised as an asset and subject to annual review for impairment.
Business combinations arising prior to the Groups transition date to IFRS 1 January 2004 have not been revisited under the exemption provided by IFRS 1.
Deferred tax liabilities have, however, now been recognised on fair value adjustments that arose from past business combinations in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes.
Cairn has used the exemption granted under s230 1 b of the Companies Act 1985 that allows for the non disclosure of the Income Statement of the parent company.
The profit attributable to the Company for the year ended 31 December 2006 was $164,870,000 2005: loss $11,214,000.
e Joint Ventures Cairn participates in several unincorporated Joint Ventures which involve the joint control of assets used in the Groups oil and gas exploration and producing activities.
Cairn accounts for its share of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure of Joint Ventures in which the Group holds an interest, classified in the appropriate Balance Sheet and Income Statement headings.
Cairns principal licence interests are jointly controlled assets.
A list of Cairns interests in unincorporated joint ventures is given on page 70. f Revenue and other income Revenue from operating activities Revenue represents Cairns share of oil, gas and condensate production, recognised on a direct entitlement basis and tariff income received for third party use of operating facilities and pipelines in accordance with agreements.
Other income Income received as operator from Joint Ventures is recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with Joint Venture agreements and is included within Other operating income in the Income Statement.
Interest income is recognised using the effective interest method on an accruals basis and is recognised within Finance income in the Income Statement.
g Oil and gas intangible exploration appraisal assets and property, plant & equipment development producing assets Cairn follows a successful efforts based accounting policy for oil and gas assets.
Costs incurred prior to obtaining the legal rights to explore an area are expensed immediately to the Income Statement.
Expenditure incurred on the acquisition of a licence interest is initially capitalised on a licence by licence basis.
Costs are held, un-depleted, within exploration until such a time as the exploration phase on the licence area is complete or commercial reserves have been discovered.
Exploration expenditure incurred in the process of determining exploration targets is capitalised initially within exploration appraisal assets and subsequently allocated to drilling activities.
Exploration appraisal drilling costs are initially capitalised on a well by well basis until the success or otherwise of the well has been established.
The success or failure of each exploration appraisal effort is judged on a well by well basis.
Drilling costs are written off on completion of a well unless the results indicate that hydrocarbon reserves exist and there is a reasonable prospect that these reserves are commercial.
Following appraisal of successful exploration wells, if commercial reserves are established and the technical feasibility of extraction demonstrated, then the related capitalised exploration appraisal costs are transferred into a single field cost centre within development producing assets after testing for impairment see opposite.
Where results of exploration drilling indicate the presence of hydrocarbons which are ultimately not considered commercially viable, all related costs are written off to the Income Statement.
All costs incurred after the technical feasibility and commercial viability of producing hydrocarbons has been demonstrated are capitalised within development producing assets on a field by field basis.
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only where it either enhances the economic benefits of the development producing asset or replaces part of the existing development producing asset.
Any costs remaining associated with the part replaced are expensed.
76 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Net proceeds from any disposal of an exploration asset are initially credited against the previously capitalised costs.
Any surplus proceeds are credited to the Income Statement.
Net proceeds from any disposal of development producing assets are credited against the previously capitalised cost.
A gain or loss on disposal of a development producing asset is recognised in the Income Statement to the extent that the net proceeds exceed or are less than the appropriate portion of the net capitalised costs of the asset.
Depletion Cairn depletes separately, where applicable, any significant components within development producing assets, such as fields, processing facilities and pipelines which are significant in relation to the total cost of a development producing asset.
Cairn depletes expenditure on property, plant & equipment development producing assets on a unit of production basis, based on proved and probable reserves on a field by field basis.
In certain circumstances, fields within a single development area may be combined for depletion purposes.
Impairment Exploration appraisal assets are reviewed regularly for indicators of impairment and costs are written off where circumstances indicate that the carrying value might not be recoverable.
In such circumstances the exploration asset is allocated to development producing assets within the same geographic segment, as disclosed in the segmental analysis notes to the financial statements, and tested for impairment.
Any such impairment arising is recognised in the Income Statement for the period.
Where there are no development producing assets within a geographic segment, the exploration appraisal costs are charged immediately to the Income Statement.
Impairment reviews on development producing assets are carried out on each cash-generating unit identified in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
Cairns cash generating units are those assets which generate largely independent cash flows and are normally, but not always, single development areas.
At each reporting date, where there are indicators of impairment, the net book value of the cash generating unit is compared with the associated expected discounted future net cash flows.
If the net book value is higher, then the difference is written off to the Income Statement as impairment.
Discounted future net cash flows for IAS 36 purposes are calculated using an estimated oil price of $30 bbl 2005: $20 bbl or the appropriate gas price as dictated by the relevant gas sales contract, escalation for prices and costs of 3% and a discount rate of 10% 2005: 3% and 10% respectively.
Forecasted production profiles are determined on an asset by asset basis, using appropriate petroleum engineering techniques.
Where there has been a charge for impairment in an earlier period, that charge will be reversed in a later period where there has been a change in circumstances to the extent that the discounted future net cash flows are higher than the net book value at the time.
In reversing impairment losses, the carrying amount of the asset will be increased to the lower of its original carrying value or the carrying value that would have been determined net of depletion had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
h Property, plant and equipment other Property, plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment and depreciated over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Depreciation Method Tenants improvements 10 33 straight line Vehicles and equipment 25 50 straight line Depreciation is charged over the shorter of 2 10 years or the remaining term of the lease.
i Intangible assets other Intangible assets have finite useful lives and are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment and amortised over their expected useful economic lives as follows: Annual Rate % Amortisation Method Software costs 25 50 straight line CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 77 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED j Investments The Companys investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less provisions resulting from impairment.
The recoverable value of investments is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
Value in use is based on the discounted future net cash flows of the oil and gas assets held by the subsidiary.
The Groups unlisted investments are carried at cost where there is no quoted market price available.
k Inventory Inventories of oil and condensate held at the balance sheet date are valued at net realisable value based on the estimated selling price in accordance with established industry practice.
l Financial instruments Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as foreign currency options to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives during the year that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken directly to the Income Statement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoiced amount less any allowances for doubtful debts.
Other debtors are recognised and measured at nominal value.
Trade and other receivables are recognised when invoiced.
Bank deposits Bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months are held as a separate category of current asset and presented on the face of the Balance Sheet.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Trade payables and other creditors Trade payables and other creditors are non-interest bearing and are measured at cost.
Interest bearing bank loans and borrowings All interest bearing bank loans and borrowings represent amounts drawn under the Groups revolving credit facilities, classified according to the length of time remaining under the respective facility.
Loans are initially measured at fair value less directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition, interest bearing loans are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Interest payable is accrued in the Income Statement using the effective interest rate method.
Finance leases Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inception of the lease or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged to the Income Statement, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Groups general policy on borrowing costs see over.
78 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Borrowing costs Borrowing costs are recognised in the Income Statement in the period in which they are incurred except for borrowing costs incurred on borrowings directly attributable to development projects which are capitalised within the development producing asset.
m Equity Equity instruments issued by Cairn are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs, allocated between share capital and share premium.
n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of current tax and deferred tax.
The current tax is based on taxable loss profit for the year.
Taxable loss profit differs from net loss profit as reported in the Income Statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable loss profit.
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences except in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax liability is not recognised if a temporary difference arises on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences and carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax assets and unused tax losses can be utilised except where the deferred income tax asset relating to the deductible temporary timing difference arises from the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in Joint Ventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred income tax assets is reviewed at each Balance Sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the deferred income tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where they arise within the same entity and tax jurisdiction and the group intends either to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
o Decommissioning At the end of the producing life of a field, costs are incurred in removing and decommissioning production facilities.
Cairn recognises the full discounted cost of dismantling and decommissioning as an asset and liability when the obligation arises.
The decommissioning asset is included within property, plant & equipment development producing assets with the cost of the related installation.
The liability is included within provisions.
Revisions to the estimated costs of decommissioning which alter the level of the provisions required are also reflected in adjustments to the decommissioning asset.
The amortisation of the asset, calculated on a unit of production basis based on proved and probable reserves, is included in the Depletion and decommissioning charge in the Income Statement, and the unwinding of discount of the provision is included within Finance costs.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 79 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED p Foreign currencies In the accounts of individual Group companies, Cairn translates foreign currency transactions into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the transaction date.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date.
Exchange differences arising are taken to the Income Statement except for those incurred on borrowings specifically allocable to development projects, which are capitalised as part of the cost of the asset.
Cairn maintains the accounts of the parent and subsidiary undertakings in their functional currency.
Where applicable, Cairn translates parent and subsidiary accounts into the presentational currency, $, using the closing rate method for assets and liabilities which are translated into $ at the rate of exchange prevailing at the Balance Sheet date and rates at the date of transactions for Income Statement accounts.
Cairn takes exchange differences arising on the translation of net assets of Group companies whose functional currency is non $ directly to reserves.
Rates of exchange to $1 were as follows: 31 December Average 31 December Average 2006 2006 2005 2005 Sterling 0.511 0.543 0.578 0.549 q Employee benefits Pension schemes Cairn operates defined contribution pension schemes in the UK and India.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of Cairn and its subsidiaries.
Cairn also operates an insured benefit scheme for certain Indian and Bangladeshi employees as required under local legislation.
In accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benefits this is treated as a defined contribution scheme.
The pension cost charged represents contributions payable in the year in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
Share schemes The cost of awards to employees under Cairns LTIP and share option plans, granted after 7 November 2002, are recognised over the three year period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the shares as measured at the date of the award.
The shares are valued using either the black scholes or binomial model, further details of which are given in note 5.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and or service conditions are fulfilled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award the vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Companys best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest.
The Income Statement charge or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense as recognised at the beginning and end of that period.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense if the terms had not been modified.
An additional expense is recognised for any modification, which increases the total fair value of the share-based payment arrangement, or is otherwise beneficial to the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
Shares acquired to meet awards under these shares schemes are held by the ESOP Trust.
The accounts of the ESOP Trust are aggregated into these financial statements.
The costs of awards to employees, in the form of cash but based on share performance phantom options are recognised over the period to which the performance relates.
The amount recognised is based on the fair value of the liability arising from the transaction.
80 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Termination benefits Cairn recognises a liability for termination benefits at the point where the Group is committed to making the payments in return for employee redundancy.
r Operating lease commitments Cairn charges rental payable under operating leases to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
s Exceptional items Exceptional items are those not considered to be part of the normal operation of the business.
Such items are identified as exceptional and a full explanation is given in the notes to the accounts.
t Key estimations and assumptions The Group has used estimates and assumptions in arriving at certain figures within the financial statements.

3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS Operating segments The Groups operating segments were revised following the restructuring carried out in anticipation of the IPO in India to reflect the revised organisational structure.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, the Groups operating activities were internally reported to the chief operating decision maker based on two separable areas grouped into different subsidiary entities: Capricorn Energy Limited Group and Cairn India Limited Group.
A third segment Other exists to accumulate Cairn UK Holdings Limited and Cairn Energy PLC company which will include the administrative expenses of Cairns head office in Edinburgh.
This also includes taxation and interest expenses of the Group which cannot be allocated to an operating segment.
In 2005 the operating segments were North Sea, South Asia and Head Office Costs.
Comparative information has been restated to reflect the new operating segments.
There is no overall financial impact of this change.

The gain on sale in 2005 arose on the sale of assets, which completed in March 2005, as part of the ONGC transaction.
d Transaction with ONGC In March 2005 Cairn completed the transaction with ONGC whereby Cairn farmed-out interests in Blocks KG-DWN-98 2 90% and CB OS-2 15% exploration interest and 10% interest in the Lakshmi and Gauri Development Areas and farmed-in to interests in Blocks GV-ONN-97 1 30% and CB-ONN-2001 1 30%.
On completion, Cairn received gross proceeds of $135m.
A working capital adjustment of $5.2m was paid to ONGC in July 2005 and professional costs of $2.3m were incurred in the completion of the deal.
The operating profits from the farmed-out interests in the CB OS-2 producing interest have been recognised in the Income Statement up to the date of completion.
The farmed-out assets were included within the India geographical segment.
A total gain on sale of $15.3m was recognised in the Income Statement in 2005 in respect of the farm-out.
$2.2m of this gain is in respect of intangible exploration appraisal assets.
The proceeds relating to the sale of the development producing assets were compared to the appropriate share of costs and the resultant gain of $13.1m was recognised in the Income Statement in 2005.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 85 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 4 OPERATING LOSS PROFIT CONTINUED e Impairment of oil and gas assets During the year the Group carried out an impairment review of certain specific cash generating units within property, plant & equipment development producing assets.
The review determined that the commercial viability of some of the units in the Capricorn Group segment has been exhausted.
As a result an exceptional write down was charged to the Income Statement.

The Cairn Energy PLC share options have been valued using a binomial model.
The main inputs to the model include the number of options, share price, leaver rate, trigger points, discount rate and volatility.
Leaver rate assumptions are based on past history of employees leaving the Company prior to options vesting and are revised to equal the number of options that ultimately vest.
Trigger points are the profit points at which the relevant percentage of employees are assumed to exercise their options.
The risk free rate is based on the yield on a zero coupon Government bond with a term equal to the expected term on the option being valued.
Volatility was determined as the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares of a peer group of similar companies selected from the FTSE over a 10 year period to the date of award as disclosed in the Directors Remuneration Report over a ten year period to the date of award.
The main inputs to the model are as per the share options scheme above.

The Groups strategy has been to finance its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
Other alternatives like equity finance and project finance are reviewed by the Board, when appropriate, to fund substantial acquisitions or oil and gas development projects.
The Group and local treasury functions are responsible for managing investment and funding requirements including banking and cash flow monitoring.
They must also recognise and manage interest and foreign exchange exposure whilst ensuring that Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn Energy PLC Group has adequate liquidity at all times in order to meet its immediate cash requirements.
Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn Energy PLC Group may from time to time, opt to use derivative financial instruments to minimise its exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange and interest rates.
During the year, Cairn Energy PLC Group entered into a currency exchange option contract in order to hedge the impact of currency fluctuations resulting from transactions carried out in Indian Rupees as part of the IPO.
The movement in fair value of the currency exchange contract is disclosed in note 8 to the financial statements.
The main risks arising from Cairn Energy PLC and Cairn Energy PLC Groups financial instruments are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk, commodity price risk and credit risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these are summarised below: Liquidity risk Cairn Energy PLC and certain of its subsidiaries signed a $1billion hybrid unsecured syndicated revolving credit facility on 27 June 2006 principally to finance development activities in Rajasthan.
On 22 November 2006 the Group signed an Amendment Agreement to the above facility to transfer, following the IPO, $850m of the facility to Cairn India Holdings Limited Group a 100% subsidiary of Cairn India to fund Rajasthan developments and to cancel the remaining $150m of the facility.
Immediately upon signing the Amendment the amount available to drawdown was capped at $300m $150m corporate facility and $150m Rajasthan development.
CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 107 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED 27 FINANCIAL RISk MANAGEMENT: OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES CONTINUED Liquidity risk continued Following the listing of Cairn India on the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange of India the above Amendment Agreement become fully effective on 31 January 2007.
On this date, the amount available to drawdown was capped at $75m as Cairn India Limited retained $600m from the proceeds of the IPO.
The balance of the $850m facility becomes available once certain condition precedents are met regarding the development.
The facility is provided by a consortium of 10 International banks expiry date 31 December 2011 and the International Finance Corporation expiry date 31 December 2015.
Interest is charged at floating rates determined by LIBOR plus an applicable margin.
The maximum that can be drawn at any point in time is determined by reference to the net present value of the Rajasthan developments.
The Group may cancel and repay the facility at any time.
In addition, as at 31 December 2006 $65m 2005: $35m of facilities are in place to cover the issue of bank guarantees.
Fixed rates of interest apply to these.
Following the IPO the facilities for the issue of bank guarantees have been replaced with revised facilities of $55m for Cairn India and of $45m for Capricorn Energy Limited.
The Group currently has surplus cash that it has placed on short and medium term deposit, ensuring sufficient liquidity to enable the Group to meet its short medium term expenditure requirements.
Interest rate risk Surplus funds are placed on short medium term deposit at floating rates.
It is Cairns policy to deposit funds with banks or other financial institutions that offer the most competitive interest rate at time of issue.
Short medium term borrowing arrangements are available at floating rates.
The treasury function may from time to time opt to manage a proportion of the interest costs on this debt by using derivative financial instruments like interest rate swaps.
At this time, however, there are no such instruments 2005: none.
Foreign currency risk Cairn manages exposures that arise from receipt of revenues in foreign currencies, by matching receipts and payments in the same currency, and actively managing the residual net position.
In order to minimise Cairns exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, currency assets are matched with currency liabilities by borrowing or entering into foreign exchange contracts in the applicable currency if deemed appropriate.
The loan facilities allow loans denominated in US dollars, sterling, Euro or such other currency as may be agreed between the lenders and Cairn from time to time.
Cairn reports in US dollars which, with most assets US dollar denominated, minimises the impact of foreign exchange movements on the Groups Balance Sheet.
During the year the Group completed an IPO of Cairn India Limited on the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange of India.
These transactions took place in Indian Rupees and gave rise to a foreign currency risk.
This risk was mitigated by the Group entering into foreign currency options to convert Rs45bn to sterling.
Commodity price risk There are implicit product price hedges in place through the pricing mechanisms applicable to Sangu, Lakshmi and Ravva Gas Sales Contracts GSCs.
The requirement for hedging instruments to unwind these pricing mechanisms is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
These implicit product price hedges do not give rise to any embedded derivatives under IAS 39.
Ravva and CB-OS 2 oil sales are required to be made to approved government nominated buyers at floating prices.
No commodity price hedging contracts have been entered into during either the current or the previous year.
There were no outstanding commodity price contracts at the start of the year or at the end of the year.
108 CAIRN ENERGY PLC ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2006 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS CONTINUED Credit risk Cairn has obtained payment guarantees or letters of credit from buyers as payment security on both the Lakshmi and Sangu GSCs.
With respect to Ravva there is no payment security, however the buyers have been nominated by the GoI.
With respect to deposit, money market and other treasury arrangements, as a general rule the Cairn Board will only approve a bank or financial institution that has a Moodys or Standard & Poors rating for long term deposits of A and above.
Banks rated A offer good credit quality.
The Board will continue to assess the Groups strategies for managing credit risks but at this time they view existing policies as satisfactory for oil and gas sales in South Asia.
At the year end the Group does not have any significant concentrations of bad debt risk other than that disclosed in note 17.
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by the carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date.
28 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Group and Company calculates the fair value of assets and liabilities by reference to amounts considered to be receivable or payable on the Balance Sheet date.

Ravva is an unincorporated Joint Venture in which Cairn has an interest.
An arbitration panel opined in October 2004 and Cairn has been willing to be bound by the award, although it was not as favourable as had been hoped.
The GoI, however, has lodged an appeal in the Malaysian courts and Cairn continues to maintain their challenge to the GoIs appeal.
Cairn has challenged both the GoIs right to appeal, and the grounds of that appeal.
If the GoI were successful on both these points, it is unclear what process would then follow to resolve the original issue under dispute.
Cairn will defend its right to continue to refer to the existing arbitration panel, whose composition and terms of reference were agreed by all parties at the outset.
It is expected that this appeal will be heard sometime during 2007.
In the event that the GoIs appeal succeeded and a process then ensued which concluded with the arbitration award being reversed in a manner and a forum which Cairn accepted as binding, then Cairn would be due to pay an additional $63.9m.
In a separate and unrelated dispute related to the profit petroleum calculations under the Ravva PSC, the Ravva JV received a claim from the DGH for approximately $166.4m representing $37.4m net to Cairn for an alleged underpayment of profit petroleum to the Indian Government, together with interest on that amount through to 30 June 2006 of $30.6m representing $6.9m net to Cairn.
This claim relates to the Indian Governments allegation that the Ravva JV has recovered costs in excess of the Base Development Costs BDC cap imposed in the PSC and that the Ravva JV has also allowed these excess costs in the calculation of the PTRR.
Cairn believes that such a claim is unsustainable under the terms of the PSC because, amongst other reasons, the BDC cap only applies to the initial development of the Ravva field and not to subsequent development activities under the PSC.
Additionally the Ravva JV has also contested the basis of the calculation in the above claim from the DGH.
Even if upheld, Cairn believes that the DGH has miscalculated the sums that would be due to the Indian Government in such circumstances.
