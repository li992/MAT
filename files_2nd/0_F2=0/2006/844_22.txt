Notes to the consolidated accounts 1 Significant accounting policies AMEC plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom.
Statement of compliance The group accounts include the accounts of AMEC plc AMEC and all of its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year, and the groups share of the profit after interest and tax, and net assets of joint ventures and associates, based on the equity method of accounting.
In accordance with EU law IAS Regulation EC 1606 2002, the consolidated accounts of the group have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS adopted for use in the EU as at 31 December 2006 adopted IFRS and those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The company has elected to prepare its parent company accounts in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles UK GAAP : these are presented on pages 102 to 107.
IFRS 7 Financial instruments: disclosure was available for early adoption but has not been applied by the group in the consolidated accounts.
The application of IFRS 7 in 2006 would not have affected the balance sheet or income statement as the standard is concerned only with disclosure.
The group plans to adopt IFRS 7 in 2007.
During 2006 IFRIC 12 on service concession arrangements was issued.
This interpretation is effective from 1 January 2008, but has yet to be adopted for use in the EU.
In view of this, the directors consider that it remains appropriate to apply the approach set out in Application Note F of the UK Financial Reporting Standard 5 Reporting the substance of transactions in determining the accounting model to be applied to AMECs PPP activities.
This involves applying a risks and rewards test to determine whether a non-current asset or finance debtor model should be followed.
The directors do not expect this accounting policy to be significantly different to that under IFRIC 12.
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated accounts.
Basis of preparation The accounts are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.
They are prepared on the historical cost basis except that derivative financial instruments and retirement benefit assets and liabilities are stated at fair value.
The preparation of accounts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses.
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis.
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Some of these policies require a high level of judgement, and AMEC believes that the most critical accounting policies and significant areas of judgement and estimation arise from the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes under IAS 19 Employee benefits and for long-term contracts under IAS 11 Construction contracts.
Defined benefit pension schemes are accounted for in accordance with the advice of independent qualified actuaries but significant judgements are required in relation to the assumptions for future salary and pension increases, inflation, investment returns and member longevity that underpin their valuations.
A significant amount of the groups activities are undertaken via long-term contracts.
These contracts are accounted for in accordance with IAS 11 which requires estimates to be made for contract costs and revenues.
Management base their judgements of contract costs and revenues on the latest available information, which includes detailed contract valuations.
In many cases the results reflect the expected outcome of long-term contractual obligations which span more than one reporting period.
Contract costs and revenues are affected by a variety of uncertainties that depend on the outcome of future events and often need to be revised as events unfold and uncertainties are resolved.
The estimates of contract costs and revenues are updated regularly and significant changes are highlighted through established internal review procedures.
In particular, the internal reviews focus on the timing and recognition of incentive payments and the age and recoverability of any unagreed income from variations to the contract scope or claims.
The impact of the changes in accounting estimates is then reflected in the ongoing results.
On 27 July 2006, AMEC SPIE was sold to PAI partners.
The results of AMEC SPIE for the period to 27 July 2006 are consolidated in these accounts.
During 2006, AMEC decided to exit from pipeline construction as a line of business.
AMECs pipeline construction business comprised three companies which were actively marketed during 2006.
One of these companies, US Pipelines Inc, was sold in September 2006, and the sale process of the remaining two companies is ongoing.
As a result of the above, both AMEC SPIE and Pipelines are treated as discontinued operations in 2006.
In accordance with IFRS 5, the post-tax results of discontinued operations are disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement, with the 2005 consolidated income statement and notes 2 to 8 being restated for the same presentation.
The results and other disclosures in respect of discontinued operations are shown in note 9.
The cash flows are fully consolidated within AMEC up to the date of sale and the assets and liabilities of discontinued operations that have not been sold at the year end are shown separately on the consolidated balance sheet.
In accordance with IFRS 5, neither the consolidated balance sheet nor the consolidated cash flow statement are restated to exclude discontinued operations.

AMEC SPIE retained a controlling interest and the results of the rail business were therefore equity accounted as an associate in 2006, with SPIEs 50% share of its results presented as discontinued.
The 2005 consolidated income statement has been restated for the same presentation.
In the 2005 consolidated cash flow statement, the cost of acquisition of shares by trustees of the Performance Share Plan 2002 of 8.7 million was offset against the income statement charge of 7.9 million and the net amount presented as a cash flow from operating activities.
In the 2006 consolidated cash flow statement the cost of acquiring these shares has been presented separately as a cash flow from financing activities.
Basis of consolidation A subsidiary is an entity controlled by AMEC.
Control is achieved where AMEC has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
A joint venture entity is an entity over whose activities AMEC has joint control, established by contractual agreement.
An associate is an entity in which AMEC has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
The consolidated accounts include the groups share of the total recognised gains and losses of associates and jointly controlled entities on an equity accounted basis.
The results of joint venture entities and associates are included in the consolidated accounts from the date that joint control or significant influence commences until the date that it ceases.
Losses of a joint venture or an associate are recognised only to the extent of the groups interest in the joint venture or associate, unless the group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture or associate.
Jointly controlled operations and assets where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets it controls, liabilities and cash flows it incurs and its share of the income measured according to the terms of the arrangement.
Bid costs Bid costs are expensed as incurred until the group is appointed as the preferred bidder.
Subsequent to appointment as preferred bidder, bid costs are capitalised and held on the balance sheet provided the award of the contract is virtually certain and it is expected to generate sufficient net cash flow to allow recovery of the bid costs.
Where bid costs are reimbursed at financial close, the proceeds are applied first against the balance of costs included in the balance sheet, with any additional amounts treated as deferred income and released to profit over the period of the contract.
Business combinations and goodwill The purchase method is used to account for all business combinations.
Goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the purchase consideration over the fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions since 1 January 2004 is capitalised and subject to an impairment review, both annually and when there are indications that its carrying value may not be recoverable.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made prior to 1 January 1998 has been written-off to reserves.
Under IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards and IFRS 3 Business Combinations this goodwill will now remain eliminated against reserves.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions made in the period from 1 January 1998 to 31 December 2003 was capitalised and amortised under UK GAAP.
This goodwill is carried at the UK GAAP carrying value at the date of transition to IFRS and is subject to impairment reviews as described above.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of AMECs cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Construction and other long-term contracts As soon as the outcome of a construction or other long-term contract can be estimated reliably, contract revenue and expenses are recognised in the income statement in proportion to the stage of completion of the contract.
The stage of completion is assessed by reference to surveys of work performed.
When the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated reliably, revenue is recognised only to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recovered, and contract costs are expensed as incurred.
An expected loss on a contract is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Revenue in respect of variations to the contract scope and claims is recognised when it is probable that it will be received and is capable of being reliably measured.
Incentive payments are recognised when a contract is sufficiently far advanced that it is probable that the required conditions will be met and the amount of the payment can be reliably measured.
The gross amounts due from customers under construction and other long-term contracts are stated at cost plus recognised profits, less provision for recognised losses and progress billings.
These amounts are reported in trade and other receivables.
Payments on account in excess of the gross amounts due from customers are included in trade and other payables.
Discontinued operations and assets and liabilities held for sale A discontinued operation is a separate major line of business or geographic area of operations that has either been disposed of or is held for sale, or is a subsidiary acquired exclusively with a view to resale.
An operation is classified as a discontinued operation when the above criteria are met, and the comparative income statement is restated to show the operation as discontinued from the start of the comparative period.
Notes to the consolidated accounts AMEC plc annual report 2006 71 4155 AMEC back 06. indd 71 4 4 07 10:59:08 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 1 Significant accounting policies continued Non-current assets or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use are classified as held for sale.
Immediately before classification as held for sale, the assets or components of a disposal group are remeasured in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
Thereafter generally the assets or disposal group are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, and retirement benefit assets, which continue to be measured in accordance with the groups accounting policies.
Impairment losses on initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss.
Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Employee benefits Defined contribution plans Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Defined benefit plans The groups net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods: that benefit is discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets at bid price is deducted.
The liability discount rate is the yield at the balance sheet date on AA rated corporate bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised directly in equity in the year in which they arise.
Financial instruments Financial instruments are initially recorded at fair value.
Subsequent valuation depends on the designation of the instrument.
Cash, deposits and short-term investments are held at amortised cost.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially and subsequently at fair value.
The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the group would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counterparties.
No quoted market prices are available for the forward exchange contracts that AMEC enters into.
Consequently, fair value is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
The sale and purchase of derivative financial instruments are non-speculative.
Cash flow hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly probable forecast transaction, any gain or loss on the effective part of the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The gain or loss on any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, expires, or is sold, terminated or exercised.
The cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in the hedging reserve remains there until the forecast transaction occurs.
Where the hedged item is a non-financial asset, the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is transferred to the carrying amount of the asset when the asset is recognised.
In other cases the cumulative gain or loss in the hedging reserve is transferred to profit or loss in the same period that the hedged item affects profit or loss.
Fair value hedges Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge against the variability in fair value of a recognised asset or liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recognised immediately in the income statement.
The carrying value of the hedged item is adjusted by the change in fair value that is attributable to the risk being hedged even if it is normally carried at cost or amortised cost and any gains or losses on re-measurement are recognised immediately in the income statement.
When hedge accounting ceases, any adjustment made to the carrying amount of the hedged item as a consequence of the fair value hedge relationship, is recognised in the income statement over the remaining life of the hedged item.
Foreign currencies Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Trading results are translated at average rates for the year.
Foreign exchange differences arising on the translation of trading results and monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign currency net investments and foreign currency borrowings, or forward contracts used to hedge those investments, are taken to a translation reserve.
They are recycled and recognised as a profit or loss on the disposal or closure of a business.
The cumulative translation difference for all foreign operations was deemed to be zero as at the date of transition to adopted IFRS.
Impairment The carrying values of all of the groups assets other than inventories, balances on construction contracts and deferred tax assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment.
If there are indications of an impairment in the carrying value then the recoverable amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount.
For goodwill and assets not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.

The cost of an intangible asset acquired in a business combination is fair value at date of acquisition.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, from the date they are available for use.
The estimated lives of intangible assets held at 31 December 2006 are as follows: Software Three to five years Customer relationships Three to ten years Tradenames Five years Inventories Inventories, including land held for and in the course of development, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Development land and work in progress is included at cost less any losses foreseen in completing and disposing of the development.
Cost includes cost of acquisition and development to date, including directly attributable fees and expenses net of rental and other income attributable to the development.
Leases Operating lease costs are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Net financing costs Net financing costs comprise interest payable, interest receivable on funds invested and foreign exchange gains and losses.
Interest income and interest payable are recognised in profit or loss as they accrue, using the effective interest method.
Directly attributable finance costs are capitalised in the cost of purchased and constructed property, plant and equipment, until the relevant assets are brought into operational use.
The only material projects where this has occurred are those held in the groups investments in joint ventures which are involved in PPP projects to finance, design and build assets and operate them on behalf of the client.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
The cost of property, plant and equipment at 1 January 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, was determined by reference to its fair value at that date.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, with the exception of freehold land, at rates calculated to write-off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life.
Reviews are made annually of the estimated remaining lives and residual values of individual assets.
The estimated lives used are: Freehold buildings Up to 50 years Leasehold land and buildings The shorter of the lease term or 50 years Plant and equipment Mainly three to five years Revenue Revenue is measured at the fair value of consideration received or receivable, excluding value added tax, for goods and services supplied to external customers.
It includes the groups share of revenue from work carried out under jointly controlled operations.
Revenue from services and construction contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract, as set out in the accounting policy for construction and other long-term contracts.
Revenue from developments activities is recognised on completion of a signed sale agreement after all material conditions have been met.
Share-based payments There are share-based payment arrangements which allow AMEC employees to acquire AMEC shares: these awards are granted by AMEC.
The fair value of awards granted is recognised as a cost of employment with a corresponding increase in equity.
The fair value is measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the award.
The fair value of the award is measured using a valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were granted.
The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the actual number of shares that vest except where non-vesting is due only to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Taxation The charge for taxation is based on the results for the year and comprises current and deferred tax.
Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on taxable income for the year, using statutory tax rates, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities recognised in the accounts and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit, and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.

As the groups management and internal reporting are now structured by class of business, this has become the basis for the groups primary segment reporting.
The business and financial review is based on the reported results before joint venture tax, intangible amortisation and pre-tax exceptional items, but including joint venture profit before tax.
The results as presented in the business and financial review are reconciled to those presented in this note in the tables on pages 42 and 43.
The segmental analysis of discontinued operations is shown in note 9.

The financing of the groups activities is undertaken at a head office level and consequently net financing costs cannot be analysed segmentally.
The unallocated net assets and liabilities principally comprise assets relating to the pension schemes, and liabilities relating to dividends and taxation and are not directly related to the activities of the segments.
Goodwill is not directly attributable to business segments and there is no reasonable basis for allocation of goodwill to business segments.

Substantially all UK members are in funded defined benefit schemes, the main schemes being the AMEC Staff Pension Scheme and the AMEC Executive Pension Scheme.
The majority of overseas members are in defined contribution schemes.
Contributions by the group into defined contribution schemes are disclosed in note 6.
Defined benefit schemes The valuations used have been based on the most recent valuations of the two major UK schemes as at 31 December 2004 and 1 April 2005, and updated by the schemes actuaries for the requirement to assess the present value of the liabilities of the schemes as at 31 December 2006.
The assets of the schemes are stated at their aggregate market value as at 31 December.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries in relation to the main UK schemes are as follows: 2006 2005 Per cent Per cent Rate of discount 5.1 4.9 Rate of inflation 3.0 2.8 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0 3.8 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 3.0 2.8 Expected rate of return on scheme assets: Equities 7.7 7.6 Bonds 4.4 4.4 Property 6.2 6.1 Other 4.5 4.5 For the main UK pension schemes, the assumed life expectancy is as follows: Male Female years years Member aged 60 current life expectancy 23.8 26.8 Member aged 40 life expectancy at 60 25.0 27.8 The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which, due to the timescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption, the company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets for the portfolio.

Hedging of interest rate risk The groups policy has been to use interest rate swaps to convert a portion of its floating rate debt to fixed and vice versa.
Following repayment of substantially all of its debt during 2006, the group has no need to hedge interest rate risk at 31 December 2006.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as cash flow hedges and fair value hedges are as follows: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Notional Notional Carrying amount Carrying amount contract amount contract amount and fair value and fair value million million million million Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges: Non-current liabilities 226.0 10.2 Interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges: Non-current liabilities 17.5 1.9 Hedging of foreign currency risk forecast transactions The group looks to mitigate the foreign exchange risk typically arising where contracts are awarded in, or involve costs, in non-local currency.
Forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are used for this purpose and designated as cash flow hedges.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of forward contracts and swaps designated as cash flow hedges are as follows: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Notional Notional Carrying amount Carrying amount contract amount contract amount and fair value and fair value million million million million Current assets 10.7 79.3 0.7 0.4 Assets classified as held for sale 18.3 1.4 Current liabilities 80.2 64.9 1.8 2.0 Non-current liabilities 13.7 0.9 109.2 157.9 0.3 2.5 The forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps designated as cash flow hedges mature predominantly over the next twelve months, in line with the hedged cash flows.
Certain forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange swaps are not designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value are recognised through the income statement.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of these forward contracts and swaps are as follows: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Notional Notional Carrying amount Carrying amount contract amount contract amount and fair value and fair value million million million million Current assets 36.4 46.6 0.1 0.4 Current liabilities 9.4 48.0 0.1 1.3 45.8 94.6 0.9 Hedging of foreign currency risk net investment hedges The group uses cross currency swaps and, until repayment of substantially all the groups debt during 2006, foreign currency denominated borrowings which have been designated as hedges of the net investments in subsidiaries in Canada, the US and formerly in France.
The notional contract amount, carrying amount and fair values of swaps designated as net investment hedges are as follows: 2006 2005 2006 2005 Notional Notional Carrying amount Carrying amount contract amount contract amount and fair value and fair value million million million million Current assets 127.5 8.2 Notes to the consolidated accounts AMEC plc annual report 2006 91 4155 AMEC back 06. indd 91 4 4 07 10:59:35 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 23 Financial instruments continued The carrying amounts of foreign currency denominated borrowings were as follows: 2006 2005 million million Borrowings denominated in: Euro 160.8 Canadian dollars 68.8 US dollars 67.0 296.6 A net foreign exchange gain for the year of 16.4 million 2005 loss of: 12.0 million was recognised in the translation reserve in respect of these swaps and borrowings.
Interest rate risk contractual maturity and repricing dates and effective interest rates In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature or are repriced if earlier than maturity: 2006 Effective More interest 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 than 5 rate Total or less months years years years Per cent million million million million million million Cash and cash equivalents 3.7 375.4 375.4 Unsecured bank loans: Sterling fixed rate loan 4.0 19.3 7.6 4.8 6.9 Bank overdrafts Sterling overdraft 6.0 1.2 1.2 354.9 366.6 4.8 6.9 2005 Effective More interest 6 months 6-12 1-2 2-5 than 5 rate Total or less months years years years Per cent million million million million million million Debt securities held-to-maturity 3.2 7.7 0.1 0.1 0.3 7.2 Cash and cash equivalents 2.4 351.9 351.9 Unsecured bank loans: Sterling floating rate loan 5.0 225.0 225.0 Effect of interest rate swaps 0.3 110.0 110.0 Euro floating rate loan 3.0 172.4 172.4 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.6 37.8 37.8 Canadian dollar floating rate loan 3.6 68.8 68.8 Effect of interest rate swaps 1.7 12.5 12.5 Unsecured bonds: Sterling fixed rate bonds 5.9 45.0 45.0 US dollar fixed rate bonds 5.1 67.0 23.3 43.7 Effect of interest rate swaps 17.4 17.4 Bank overdrafts Sterling overdraft 5.5 6.7 6.7 Euro overdraft 2.5 12.5 12.5 Other payables: Euro floating rate payable 2.8 65.8 65.8 Effect of interest rate swaps 2.5 65.8 65.8 303.6 9.4 0.1 160.2 23.0 129.9 Credit risk Trade receivable exposures are typically with large publicly quoted companies and government backed organisations, and the credit ratings of these organisations are monitored.
Credit risks are minimised through the use of letters of credit, parent company guarantees, insurance instruments and forward funding where achievable.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments recorded in the balance sheet.
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk at the balance sheet date.
No material provision had been made against trade and other receivables at 31 December 2006 2005: nil.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is estimated by discounting estimated future cash flows based on the terms and maturity of each contract and using market interest rates.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward price for the residual maturity of the contract using a risk free interest rate.
Bank loans and bonds are valued based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.

In line with counsels opinion, the excess of the proceeds of the placing over the nominal value of the shares issued created a merger reserve which was subsequently transferred to retained earnings and is available for distribution to shareholders.
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the accounts of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities and the cumulative net change in the fair value of instruments that hedge the companys net investment in foreign subsidiaries.
A qualifying share ownership trust the Quest was established on 26 August 1999.
The Quest holds shares issued by the company in connection with the savings related share option scheme.
During the year the company allotted 123,437 2005: 126,524 shares to the Quest and the Quest transferred 186,710 2005: 191,662 of these shares to employees exercising options.

Share-based payments In 1985, the group established the Savings Related Share Option Scheme, which entitles employees of the group to buy shares in the company.
Grants of share options under this scheme are offered to employees periodically, and options are exercisable at a 20 per cent discount to the market price of shares at the date of grant.
Under the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, directors and senior employees of the group have been granted share options, which carry a non-market based performance condition.
Until September 2004, the Performance Share Plan 2002 was operated alongside the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002, but since then awards have been made under the Performance Share Plans only.
Under this plan, share awards are made to directors and senior employees of the group, subject to both market and non-market based performance tests.
All of the share-based payment arrangements operated by the group are equity-settled.
Options are granted with a maximum term of ten years.
The number and weighted average exercise price of share options under the Savings Related Share Option Scheme and the Executive Share Option Scheme 2002 are as follows: Weighted Weighted average average exercise Number exercise Number price of options price of options 2006 2006 2005 2005 pence pence Outstanding on 1 January 257 17,438,769 240 14,389,582 Lapsed 277 2,998,656 250 2,009,880 Exercised 192 822,828 129 846,662 Granted 279 5,905,729 Outstanding on 31 December 257 13,617,285 257 17,438,769 Exercisable on 31 December 218 1,850,545 205 2,468,967 Options were exercised on a regular basis during the year, and the average share price for the year was 368 pence 2005: 335 pence.

The aggregate book value of the identifiable net liabilities was 2.6 million excluding overdrafts assumed and the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 17.6 million.
All acquisitions in the year have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting.
An assessment of the fair value to the group of the assets and liabilities acquired on all acquisitions has been made.
The contributions of the acquired businesses to revenue and profit were not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has been recognised on these acquisitions as a result of skilled workforces which did not meet the criteria for recognition as intangible assets at the dates of recognition.
The acquisition cost of joint ventures and other investments amounted to 23.5 million 2005: 25.0 million and principally related to investments in public private partnership projects.
The only material disposal was the sale of AMEC SPIE for a cash consideration of e1 billion 684 million which was completed on 27 July 2006.
The carrying value of the assets and liabilities sold and the profit on sale were as follows: million Property, plant and equipment 57.9 Intangible assets 269.6 Interests in joint ventures, associates and other investments 28.1 Deferred tax 33.8 Inventories 13.4 Trade and other receivables 820.1 Cash and cash equivalents 39.7 Trade and other payables 903.2 Derivative financial instruments 3.5 Retirement benefit liabilities 47.1 Net assets sold 308.8 Minority interest in net assets sold 2.1 306.7 Provisions made in respect of indemnities 52.0 Amounts recognised in profit on disposal from the hedging and translation reserves 3.1 355.6 Cash consideration received 684.3 Costs of disposal 17.2 Profit on disposal 311.5 Notes to the consolidated accounts AMEC plc annual report 2006 97 4155 AMEC back 06. indd 97 4 4 07 15:28:43 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 27 Acquisitions and disposals continued The net cash flows attributable to discontinued operations during the year were as follows: 2006 2005 million million Net cash flow from operating activities 19.2 47.0 Net cash flow from investing activities 20.5 19.7 Net cash flow from financing activities 24.5 9.6 64.2 36.9 On 20 January 2005, the group acquired all the shares in Paragon Engineering Services Inc. Paragon for 22.3 million.
Paragon is an oil and gas engineering services company based in Houston, US.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of Paragon were as follows: Fair value Recognised Book value adjustments value million million million Property, plant and equipment 1.2 0.3 0.9 Intangible assets 4.9 4.9 Trade and other receivables 7.7 7.7 Cash and cash equivalents 4.2 4.2 Deferred tax liability 0.7 0.7 Trade and other payables 4.3 4.3 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 8.8 3.9 12.7 Goodwill on acquisition 9.6 22.3 Consideration Cash 17.2 Deferred consideration 4.5 21.7 Cost of acquisition 0.6 22.3 In the period from acquisition to 31 December 2005, Paragon contributed 45.5 million to the consolidated revenue.
Its profit contribution was not material to the results of the group.
Goodwill has been recognised on the acquisition of Paragon as a result of its skilled workforce and specialist engineering expertise that did not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
On 3 July 2005, the group acquired all the shares in NNC Holdings Limited NNC for 26.1 million in cash and net debt of 13.7 million.
NNC provides consultancy and engineering services across the life of nuclear facilities in the UK, Canada and across the former Soviet Union.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets and liabilities relating to the acquisition of NNC were as follows: Fair value Recognised Book value adjustments value million million million Property, plant and equipment 4.4 1.7 2.7 Intangible assets 9.4 2.0 7.4 Inventories 8.5 8.5 Trade and other receivables 21.0 3.4 17.6 Cash and cash equivalents 1.4 1.4 Bank loans and overdrafts 14.6 0.5 15.1 Trade and other payables 26.1 2.3 28.4 Deferred tax liability 2.1 2.1 Net identifiable assets and liabilities 4.0 12.0 8.0 Goodwill on acquisition 34.1 26.1 Consideration Cash 25.3 Cost of acquisition 0.8 26.1 98 AMEC plc annual report 2006 Notes to the consolidated accounts www.

Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of NNC primarily because of its skilled workforce which did not meet the criteria for recognition as an intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
A number of smaller acquisitions were made in the year ended 31 December 2005 for an aggregate consideration net of cash acquired of 8.7 million of which 4.3 million was paid in 2004.
The aggregate book value of the identifiable assets and liabilities was 0.2 million and the aggregate goodwill arising on the acquisitions was 12.4 million.
28 Capital commitments 2006 2005 million million Contracted but not provided for in the accounts 0.3 As at 31 December 2006, there was a commitment to invest a total of 56.8 million 2005: 47.4 million in various PPP and regeneration partnership projects.
In addition, there are commitments to purchase land for a developments project of up to 15 million 2005: 15 million over the next ten years.
29 Operating leases The total obligations under non-cancellable operating lease rentals for continuing operations are as follows: 2006 2005 million million In one year or less 32.9 31.9 Between one and five years 79.4 84.5 Over five years 48.0 47.3 160.3 163.7 AMEC enters into the following types of lease: short-term plant hires: leases for motor vehicles and office equipment with lease periods of two to five years: and longer term property leases.
None of the leases includes any contingent rentals.
30 Contingent liabilities Guarantees and indemnities The borrowings of joint ventures are generally without recourse to AMEC other than for normal performance obligations which are usually given on a several basis.
These facilities were renegotiated during 2006 with AMEC no longer providing such guarantees 2005: 33.8 million.
The company and certain subsidiaries have given counter indemnities in respect of performance bonds issued, on behalf of group companies, in the normal course of business.
As at 31 December 2006, AMEC had actual commitments to invest 56.8 million 2005: 47.4 million in various existing Public Private and regeneration partnership projects note 28.
There are further commitments of 3.1 million 2005: 17.2 million relating to projects at the preferred bidder stage.
AMEC has also provided guarantees on certain existing projects to invest further amounts of up to 34.2 million 2005: 34.2 million.
AMEC believes that the circumstances under which it will be called upon to invest this contingent equity are remote.
Legal claims and actions AMEC has taken internal and external legal advice in considering known legal claims and actions made by or against the company.
Consequently, it carefully assesses the likelihood of the success of a claim or action including those identified in this note.
AMEC makes an appropriate provision for those legal claims or actions against the company on the basis of the likely outcome, but makes no provision for those which are, in its view, unlikely to succeed.
Provisions of 85.3 million 2005: 22.4 million are shown in note 24 in respect of these claims.
It is not practicable to quantify the remaining contingent liability because of the range of possible outcomes and the progress of the litigation.
The information below indicates the quantum of claims against AMEC or where we are unable to quantify the claim, an indication of the gross contract value or the amount in dispute.
As the list below involves actions by third parties against AMEC, the timing of settlement cannot be determined although AMEC is endeavouring to settle as soon as practicable.
Due to the litigation, there is no work in progress or other receivable recognised in respect of these contracts.
Whilst AMEC believes that certain claims may be covered by insurance, it is not currently practicable to assess the extent to which AMECs insurance policies will respond in the event of a settlement.
During 1994 and 1995, AMEC Construction Management Inc. ACMI, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, entered into various contracts with the United States General Services Administration GSA for the construction of courthouses in Missouri and California and for the refurbishment and seismic upgrade of a US Customs House in California.
The total value of these contracts at point of signing was in the order of US$290 million.
Due, inter alia, to unforeseen site conditions, client delays and numerous design and scope changes, ACMI suffered significant cost overruns and submitted substantial recovery claims.
Notes to the consolidated accounts AMEC plc annual report 2006 99 4155 AMEC back 06. indd 99 4 4 07 15:28:43 Notes to the consolidated accounts continued 30 Contingent liabilities continued In June 1999, GSA terminated the right of ACMI to complete one contract, which at that stage was 85 per cent complete.
ACMI contested the termination and sued the GSA for recovery of all claims on this contract.
The GSA submitted its claim against ACMI for reprocurement and other costs totalling US$32 million.
The United States Department of Justice filed a counterclaim alleging false claims on the GSA contracts and sought to argue that, as a result, ACMI had forfeited its rights to recovery of all claims.
ACMI, upon legal advice, pleaded guilty in December 2000 and November 2001 to two federal felonies and paid two fines totalling approximately US$1.2 million.
AMEC also agreed to introduce additional ethical processes and procedures, both for the North American workforce and for those staff employed by AMEC, whose responsibilities caused them to have regular business contact with AMEC Americas and thus, the US Government.
The GSA subsequently filed a motion for summary judgement seeking an order declaring that ACMI had forfeited its claims on all the projects.
ACMI opposed the motion and oral argument was held in February 2004.
During 2005, the US Court of Federal Claims ruled that ACMI had violated the US Anti-Kickback Act.
The Court stated that it intended to issue an order in respect of the Governments counter claims and the issues relating to the Anti-Kickback Act in April 2006.
The court ruled in January 2007 that ACMI claims must be forfeited and damages in respect of false claims and Anti-Kickback legislation would be payable.
Further hearings are due to take place in April 2007.
In 2001, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$103 million to build a development in Miami, Florida, which was subject to significant changes and design delays.
In January 2006, the client terminated ACMIs contract despite having taken possession of the majority of the facility.
Both parties are now in litigation in pursuit of various claims and counter claims.
ACMIs claim amounts to US$11.5 million, of which approximately half represents the claim of a subcontractor.
The clients claim amounts to a sum in excess of US$31 million.
The parties have met to mediate their differences, with some success.
All but two issues between AMEC and the client have been resolved.
The client has recently quantified their remaining claims and indicated they believe AMEC are responsible for US$5 million.
AMEC continues to work with insurers and the client in an effort to resolve these issues.
In 2000, ACMI entered into a contract with a value of US$115 million to design and build a jail for the City and County of San Francisco CCSF.
Due to unforeseen conditions, delays and interference with ACMIs design, procurement and execution of the work, ACMI suffered large cost overruns.
In 2005, lawsuits were filed by both parties.
CCSF further alleged that ACMI made false claims in connection with the project and also failed to properly maintain its California contractors licence throughout the project term.
The litigation is at the pleading stages with an initial trial date set for November 2007.
AMEC plc has been joined in this action on the basis that it is allegedly the alter ego of ACMI or, alternately, that ACMI is merely the agent of AMEC plc and thus AMEC plc is liable for ACMIs actions.
AMEC plc is vigorously defending its position.
The court recently rejected CCSFs request for summary judgement in respect of the licencing issues referred to above.
In 1999, AGRA Monenco Inc. a predecessor company of AMEC Americas Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of AMEC plc, in joint venture, entered into a contract with Jordan Magnesia Company Ltd. Jormag to design and construct a magnesium plant in Jordan with a contract value of US$84 million.
The joint venture experienced delays in completing its work under the contract and Jormag terminated the contract when work was approximately 95 per cent complete.
The joint venture commenced an action against Jormag, who counter claimed for damages it claims it suffered from the alleged default of the joint venture.
The dispute has been referred to arbitration under the terms of the contract, and the matter has only been part heard, with a final hearing date set for May 2007.
Substantial claims were made by the client against AMEC.
An arbitration hearing in 2006 awarded damages in the order of US$25 million against AMEC.
A further hearing is scheduled for May 2007 to consider potential remediation issues in respect of the plant.
Mediation is scheduled in April 2007 to address all outstanding issues.
After the terrorist attacks in September 2001, ACMI was one of four construction managers hired by the City of New York to carry out the clean up and debris removal work at the World Trade Center site.
The client was responsible for procuring insurance to protect the construction managers and various contractors from lawsuits arising out of the work.
The World Trade Center Captive Insurance Company the WTC Captive was formed and was funded with US$1 billion in Federal money to provide coverage for the City, the construction managers and the contractors who performed the work on site.
Pursuant to the insurance policy that was issued, the WTC Captive is providing a minimum of US$1 billion in insurance coverage.
This amount can increase depending upon investment returns on the US$1 billion.
The WTC Captive is providing a defence and indemnification for claims against ACMI arising out of this work.
AMEC Civil Engineering Limited was awarded a contract to refurbish the existing Thelwall viaduct which carries the M6 motorway over the Manchester Ship Canal.
Shortly prior to the expiry of the six year latent defects liability period, the Highways Agency advised AMEC that a number of bearings bearing plates had failed.
Subsequently the Highways Agency decided to replace all the 316 bearings and has raised a claim against AMEC for 37 million.
The client has instigated a dispute under the contract which is now the subject of court proceedings.
The hearing is not anticipated until January 2008.
AMEC Group Limited AGL is currently the subject of certain ongoing Health and Safety Executive investigations, in respect of: i separate incidents involving fatalities of subcontractors, namely: two separate fatalities to subcontractors at the Leftbank Apartments project in Manchester in April 2004 and April 2005: and ii a fatal accident on the Clipper platform in the North Sea.
If AGL is to be prosecuted in the Crown Court for any of these cases, it could be liable to unlimited fines.
A prosecution for AGL in relation to fatal accidents in relatively quick succession such as those at the Leftbank Apartments could have an impact on the amount of any penalty.
