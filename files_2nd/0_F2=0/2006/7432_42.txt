Share-based payments Equity-settled share option plan The Company has a number of share option schemes under which options to subscribe for the Companys Ordinary Shares have been granted to certain Directors and management, details of which are given in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 26.
Options are granted at the five-day average of the market value of the Companys shares on the date of grant.
The options can normally only be exercised after three years and are subject to the achievement of earnings per share targets imposed at the date of grant.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the option vests.
The credit for share options in respect of employee services during the period ended 29 April 2006 was 1.4m 2005: charge of 1.6m.
A credit has arisen in the current period as performance conditions for awards vesting have not been met and management have revised their estimate of the achievability of performance conditions relating to awards vesting in future periods.
The movements in the number of share options during the year are detailed in the table below.
The options outstanding at 29 April 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 186p 2005: 165p and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 7.6 years 2005: 7.8 years.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was 223p 2005: 240p.

As the minimum performance conditions have not been met, these options will lapse in the 2006 07 financial year.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using the Black Scholes model.
The inputs into the Black Scholes model are as follows: 2006 2005 Dividend yield % 2.5 2.5 Expected volatility % 25.0 25.0 Expected life years 5.4 5.4 Risk free interest rate % 4.5 4.5 Weighted average share price p 242 237 Weighted average exercise price p 242 237 Weighted average fair value p 57 56 The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur.
The expected volatility reects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Equity-settled deferred annual bonus As part of the HMV Group plc Incentive Plan for Senior Executives HIPS, as discussed more fully in the Directors Remuneration Report on pages 25 and 26, the Company makes deferred awards to certain Directors and senior management.
These awards are made in shares and the number of shares awarded is determined by reference to the market value of shares at the time the award is made, not when it is paid.
No adjustment to value is made for expected dividend income during the vesting period.
The deferred award normally vests following the third anniversary of the end of the financial year in which the award is made, subject to the achievement of certain profit related targets and the performance of the individual over the vesting period.
The credit in respect of deferred awards during the period ended 29 April 2006 was 0.9m 2005: charge of 1.5m.
A credit has arisen in the current period as performance conditions for deferred awards vesting have not been met and management have revised their estimate of the achievability of performance conditions relating to deferred awards vesting in future periods.
