10 Reconciliations between profit and underlying profit Underlying profit is used by the Board to measure and monitor the underlying trading performance of the Group and excludes certain items as shown below: Note 2006 2005 Restated m m Operating profit 146.5 101.4 Exceptional operating costs see note 11 1.5 7.0 Amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations a 10.8 11.2 Disposal of inventory revalued in business combinations b 0.1 0.9 Financial instruments c 12.1 10.1 Goodwill adjustment arising from recognition of tax losses d 2.4 Adjustments to operating profit 2.7 29.2 Underlying operating profit 149.2 130.6 Profit before tax 130.0 87.1 Adjustments to operating profit per above 2.7 29.2 Underlying profit before tax 132.7 116.3 Profit for the year 96.5 65.5 Adjustments to operating profit per above 2.7 29.2 Tax effect of adjustments to operating profit 2.3 8.6 Underlying profit for the year 96.9 86.1 a.
The Group excludes from its underlying profit figures the amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations.
2006 2005 Restated m m Amortisation of other intangible assets see note 21 14.0 12.6 Less amortisation of purchased intangible assets see note 21 3.2 1.4 Amortisation of intangibles acquired in business combinations 10.8 11.2 b. IFRS 3 requires finished goods acquired through a business combination to be valued at selling prices less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort.
Work in progress acquired in a business combination is valued at selling prices less costs to complete, costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the work not yet completed.
The fair value of inventory acquired is thus generally higher than that built post completion which includes no profit element.
This increase arising from the revaluation of acquired inventory is charged to the income statement as the inventory is consumed and is excluded from the Groups underlying profit figures.
60 Meggitt PLC Report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Reconciliations between profit and underlying profit continued c. Although the Group uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against foreign currency exposures it has decided that the costs of meeting the extensive documentation required to be able to apply hedge accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement are not merited.
The Groups underlying profit figures exclude amounts which would not have been recorded if hedge accounting had been applied.
Interest rate swaps are used as a hedge against fixed rate borrowings, but any difference between the movement in the fair values of the swaps and the associated borrowings is excluded from underlying profit.
2006 2005 m m Movement in the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts see note 31 14.0 11.1 Impact of retranslating net foreign currency assets and liabilities at spot rate 2.0 1.0 Difference between the fair value of interest rate swaps and associated fixed rate borrowings 0.1 Financial instruments Gain Loss 12.1 10.1 d. The goodwill adjustment arises from the recognition of tax losses during the year in respect of businesses acquired in earlier years.
These tax losses existed when the businesses were acquired but a deferred tax asset was not recognised at the time as the recoverability of those losses was not probable at the time the fair values were finalised.
IFRS requires that goodwill is adjusted in the year the recoverability becomes probable with a corresponding charge recorded in profit before tax.
11 Exceptional operating costs The exceptional charge in 2006 of 1.5 million relates to the consolidation in both the UK and the US of Defence Systems businesses following the acquisition of Firearms Training Systems Inc FATS.
In the UK, FATS UK is being consolidated onto the Meggitt Defence Systems Limited site in Kent.
In the US, Caswell is being consolidated onto the FATS US site in Suwanee, Georgia.
The total cost of these consolidations, which will be completed in the first half of 2008, is expected to be 3.2 million, the balance of which is expected to be expensed in 2007.
The exceptional charge in 2005 of 7.0 million includes 2.0 million for the completion of the consolidation of Meggitts polymers business into Dunlop Aerospaces facilities in the Midlands and 5.0 million arising from the requirement to move the Avica facility in Hemel Hempstead following the explosion at the Buncefield Fuel Distribution Depot.
Cash expended in the year on these items amounted to 1.8 million 2005: 5.5 million of which 0.1 million 2005: Nil related to the FATS consolidations, 0.2 million 2005: 4.5 million related to the consolidation of Meggitts polymers business, 1.0 million 2005: Nil related to the Avica facility move and 0.5 million 2005: 1.0 million related to operating exceptional costs of earlier years.
The tax credit in respect of the exceptional operating costs was 0.5 million 2005: 2.1 million.

These have been recognised in the balance sheet on acquisition to the extent that they were expected to be realised based on information at the acquisition date.
The Group has subsequently been able to use tax losses and other assets to a greater extent than anticipated on acquisition.
In those cases the value of goodwill is reduced.
In order to comply with the requirements of IAS12, Income Taxes, a charge is reported in operating expenses as shown in note 10 whilst a deferred tax credit is made.
The Group continues to make use of tax losses and other reliefs wherever possible in order to reduce the level of payments to the tax authorities, not withstanding the adverse impact on reported profits before tax.
The sensitivity of the tax char ge to changes in the tax rate is such that a one percentage point increase or reduction in the tax rate would cause the total taxation charge for 2006 to increase or reduce respectively by approximately 1.3 million.
15 Profit of parent company The consolidated profit attributable to the shareholders of Meggitt PLC includes a profit, after dividends received, of 16.8 million 2005: 70.4 million which has been dealt with in the accounts of that Company.
Meggitt PLC, which prepares its accounts in accordance with UK GAAP, has taken advantage of the legal dispensation contained in Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 allowing it not to publish a separate profit and loss account.
62 Meggitt PLC Report and accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued 16 Earnings per ordinary share Earnings per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year.
The weighted average number of shares used excludes any shares bought by the Group and held as own shares see note 38.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share adjusts the weighted average number of shares to reflect the assumption that all potentially dilutive ordinary shares convert.
For the Group this means assuming all share options in issue are exercised.

For each CGU the Group has determined its recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations.
No impairment charge was required in the year 2005: Nil and the cumulative impairment charge recognised to date was Nil 2005: Nil.
The key assumptions used in the impairment calculations were: The forecast operating cashflows for the next three years based on approved budgets and plans.
These budgets and plans are based on past performance and expectations for the market development of the CGU: An estimate of the long-term effective tax rate for the CGU: An estimate of the long-term growth rate for the CGU.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term estimate for the business in which the CGU operates: An estimate of the terminal value of the business using the Gordon Growth model.
The resulting cash flows were discounted using a post tax discount rate of 8% 2005: 8%.

On receivables allowances are made within the book value for credit risk.
For medium and long-term borrowings and other financial liabilities the fair value is based on market values or, where not available, on discounting future cash flows at prevailing market rates and by applying year end exchange rates.
Market rates have been used to determine the fair values of the interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.

These primarily relate to environmental issues pertaining to businesses sold by Whittaker Corporation prior to its acquisition by the Group.
Appropriate insurance coverage has been taken out by the Group to cover these principal known risks but such insurance may not be sufficient to cover unknown risks.
In respect of environmental matters provision has been made for the gross estimated liability and an asset of 24.7 million 2005: 44.4 million has been recognised as a receivable for the amounts recoverable from the insurers see note 25.
At acquisition, Whittaker was also subject to certain litigation claims, both existing and threatened, relating to businesses it had sold but for which it retained a liability.
A provision exists representing the best estimate of the outcome of the claims including costs.
The provisions are expected to be mainly utilised over the next ten years and are discounted using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
b Provision has been set up for the estimated rental shortfall in respect of properties with onerous lease obligations and will be utilised over the lease terms typically up to ten years and are discounted using a discount rate appropriate to each provision.
c Provision has been made for product warranty claims.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next three years.

The majority relate to the Groups operations in the USA and unutilised losses.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items, as it is not regarded as more likely than not that they will be recovered.
Deferred tax assets not recognised would be recoverable in the event that they reverse and suitable taxable profits are available.
No provision has been made for taxation that would arise in the event of foreign subsidiaries distributing their reserves as these amounts are retained for investment in the businesses.
The aggregate unrecognised deferred tax liability in respect of such unremitted earnings is 7.9 million 2005: 6.0 million.
34 Retirement benefit obligations In the UK, the majority of employees are members of the Meggitt Group 1990 Pension Plan 1990 Plan, the Meggitt Executive Pension Plan MEPP or the Dunlop Aerospace Limited UK Pension Scheme Dunlop.
These are defined benefit plans, the assets of which are held in trust funds separate from the Groups finances.
In the USA the majority of employees are covered by defined contribution 401k plans.
In 1994, prior to acquisition by the Group, Whittaker Corporation amended its 401k plans and also froze benefits to the Whittaker Corporation Employees Pension Plan Whittaker Frozen Plan, a defined benefit scheme.
In other overseas countries the Group provides pensions in accordance with statutory requirements and local customs and practice.
Such schemes are typically of a money purchase nature.
The amounts recognised in the income statement in respect of pensions are as follows: 2006 2005 m m In respect of: Defined contribution schemes see note 9 7.5 7.1 Defined benefit schemes: Service cost see note 9 10.0 8.7 Past service credit see note 9 1.8 Interest cost see note 12 21.8 20.3 Expected return on scheme assets see note 12 22.8 21.4 7.2 7.6 Total charge 14.7 14.7 Of the total charge 6.8 million 2005: 6.7 million has been included in cost of sales, 8.9 million 2005: 9.1 million in net operating expenses and a credit of 1.0 million 2005: 1.1 million included in finance income.

The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio.

Details on the sensitivity of scheme liabilities to changes in discount rates and inflation rates are provided below: The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in discount rate would cause schemes liabilities at 31 December 2006 to increase by approximately 9.0 million.
The impact of a 10 basis point reduction in inflation rate would cause schemes liabilities at 31 December 2006 to reduce by approximately 8.0 million.
In determining pension liabilities the Group uses mortality assumptions which are based on published mortality tables adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the schemes populations.
The Groups mortality assumptions are based on the PA92 medium cohort Year of birth mortality tables for the UK and the RP-2000 tables for the US schemes.

These leases have various lease periods, escalation clauses and renewal rights.
Additionally the Group also leases various items of plant and machinery under cancellable operating leases.
The expenditure on operating leases is charged to the income statement as incurred and is disclosed in note 7.
The future aggregate minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Not later than one year 0.4 1.1 Later than one year and not later than five years 6.5 5.6 Later than five years 40.5 50.0 Total 47.4 56.7 Other financial commitments The Group enters into long-term arrangements with Aircraft and or Original Equipment Manufacturers OEMs to design, develop and supply products to them for the life of the aircraft.
This represents a significant long-term financial commitment for the Group and requires the consideration of a number of uncertainties including the feasibility of the product solution and the ultimate commercial viability over a period which can extend over 40 years.
The directors are satisfied that, at this time, there are no significant unprovided contingent liabilities arising from these commitments.

Goodwill is attributable to the profitability of the acquired businesses and expected future synergies arising following the acquisitions.
Goodwill on acquisitions is based upon a provisional allocation of fair values.
These fair values, including the identification and measurement of intangible assets arising on the acquisitions will be finalised during 2007.
The acquisition of FATS is considered significant.
Since acquisition, FATS has contributed 0.6 million to Group profit after tax and has produced an operating cash outflow of 0.4 million.
FATS had a profit after tax in its last reported financial year to 31 March 2006 of $3.2 million.
In the period from the last reported financial year to acquisition, FATS had revenue of $42.5 million, an operating loss of $2.0 million, a loss before tax of $5.4 million and a loss after tax of $3.1 million.
These results were after charging $6.3m of exceptional costs.
Had FATS been part of the Group for the whole of 2006, it would have contributed revenue of $83.2 million and a profit after tax of $0.5 million.
The other acquisitions have, since acquisition, contributed 0.3 million to Group profit after tax and a 0.6 million inflow to Group operating cash.
Analysis of the net outflow of cash in respect of acquisitions: 2006 m Cash consideration FATS 67.0 Directly attributable costs FATS 1.3 Cash consideration other 17.4 Directly attributable costs other 0.6 86.3 Less net cash acquired with subsidiary undertakings FATS 4.7 Net outflow of cash and cash equivalents for acquisitions 81.6 Acquisitions in 2005 amendment of provisional fair values In August 2005 the Group acquired the business and assets of Avery-Hardoll and in November 2005 acquired Europenne fide Conception et dEtudes Technologiques ECET and Sensorex.
At 31 December 2005 the Group had allocated provisional fair values to the net assets acquired as a result of these acquisitions.
The Group finalised these fair values in 2006.
In accordance with IFRS 3 these amendments have been recorded as though they were made in 2005.
The amendments made primarily related to the recognition, separately from goodwill, of other intangibles that met the definition of intangible assets and whose fair values could be measured reliably and the revaluation of inventory to fair value.
The recognition of these assets produced a consequent reduction in the goodwill previously reported.
The assets identified were then amortised or charged to the income statement in 2005 as appropriate.
The impact on net assets and the income statement arising from the finalisation of fair values is shown in note 44.
44 Restatement of prior year comparatives IFRS 3 requires fair values of assets and liabilities acquired to be finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date with the exception of certain deferred tax balances see note 14.
All fair value adjustments are required to be recorded with effect from the date of acquisition and consequently result in the restatement of previously reported financial results.
During 2006 the Group finalised the fair values for three acquisitions completed in 2005 and this resulted in adjustments to the profit for the year ended 31 December 2005 and to the balance sheet at that date.
Further details are provided in note 43.
