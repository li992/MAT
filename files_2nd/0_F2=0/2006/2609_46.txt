For the new awards made during the year to 31 March 2006, the weighted average fair value was determined as 4.27 by applying the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
As dividends accrue during the vesting period, expected dividends were not incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The key factors used in determining the fair value of the options were as follows: Weighted average share price at grant date 4.27 Exercise price Option life 3 years Expected volatility 26.8% Risk free interest rate 4.2% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the shares over a period of time, prior to the grant, equivalent to the life of the option.
As share price information was only available for Burberry Group plc from July 2002 an average of a comparator group of companies was used prior to this date.
The average expected volatility over the life of the option was used.
30 Retirement benefit obligations Burberry Group provides post-retirement arrangements for its employees in the UK and its overseas operations, which are both defined benefit and defined contribution in nature.
Where arrangements are funded, assets are held in independently administered trusts.
The balance sheet obligations in respect of Burberry Groups post-retirement arrangements, assessed in accordance with IAS 19, were: As at As at 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Defined benefit schemes: GUS defined benefit scheme UK 1.0 Supplemental executive retirement plan US 1.4 0.9 Retirement indemnities France 0.2 0.2 Burberry Taiwan Co Ltd retirement scheme 0.2 Total pension obligation 1.8 2.1 The plans in the US are classified as defined benefit schemes under IAS 19 because their exact cost cannot be quantified as the funds are subject to notional indexation according to specified investment return indices.
No prepayments or obligations in respect of defined contributions schemes were outstanding at 31 March 2006 2005: nil.
The pension costs charged to the income statement in respect of the main plans were: Year to Year to 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 m m Defined benefit schemes: GUS defined benefit scheme UK 0.4 0.7 Supplemental executive retirement plan US 0.3 0.3 Defined contribution schemes: GUS money purchase pension plan UK 1.0 0.7 Burberry money purchase plan US 0.9 0.6 Burberry Asia Limited retirement scheme 0.1 0.1 Total pension costs 2.7 2.4 Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 87 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 30 Retirement benefit obligations continued Defined benefit schemes GUS defined benefit scheme UK Prior to the demerger of Burberry Group from GUS plc on 13 December 2005, it was agreed that existing employees of Burberry Group who were participating in the GUS defined benefit scheme the GUS Pension Scheme would continue to do so until 31 December 2007 or such earlier date as required by HM Customs & Revenue or by the Burberry Group.
When the eventual withdrawal of members of the Burberry Group from the GUS Pension Scheme takes place on or before 31 December 2007, the Burberry Group must pay any liabilities due under section 75 or 75A of the Pensions Act 1995.
GUS has indemnified Burberry Group on an after tax basis against any amounts which are in excess of 1.25m.
The following disclosures regarding the GUS defined benefit scheme UK have been included for completeness as required by IAS 19 and the assets have been restricted in accordance with the standard as it is not likely that the Burberry Group will be able to benefit from this surplus.
The GUS Pension Scheme has rules which specify the benefits to be paid and is financed accordingly, with assets being held in independently administered funds.
A full actuarial valuation of the GUS Pension Scheme is carried out every three years with interim reviews in the intervening years.
The last full valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2004 by independent qualified actuaries, Watson Wyatt Limited, using the projected unit method.
As a result of the 31 March 2004 valuation it became possible to separately identify the underlying assets and liabilities which relate to the Burberry Group.
Therefore, since the valuation, Burberry Group has accounted for its proportionate share of the overall defined benefit obligation, scheme assets and costs.
The valuation of the GUS Pension Scheme used for Burberry Groups IAS 19 disclosures for the year to 31 March 2006 has been based on an update of the 31 March 2004 valuation.
As at 31 March 2006, this update showed that there was an excess in the value of the assets of the GUS Pension Scheme, when compared to the value of the liabilities, on the basis set out below.
The overall excess was approximately 22.2m as at 31 March 2006 2005: deficit 6.6m before allowing for deferred tax.
Burberrys Groups proportionate share of this excess was approximately 1.8m 2005: deficit 1.0m before allowing for deferred tax.
This surplus has been restricted as explained above.
Burberry Groups disclosures in respect of its continued participation in the GUS Pension Scheme are shown below.
The disclosures are in accordance with IAS 19 and recognise all gains losses immediately through a Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expenses.
The valuation assumptions The principal actuarial assumptions used in the IAS 19 valuation of the Burberry Groups portion of the GUS Pension Scheme are the same as those used for the whole of the GUS Pension Scheme and are shown below: Year to Year to 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 %% Discount rate 4.9% 5.4% Rate of inflation 2.9% 2.9% Rate of salary increases 4.7% 4.7% Rate of increases for pensions in payment and deferred pensions 2.9% 2.9% Expected return on plan assets 6.8% 7.0% The expected return on plan assets is calculated by reference to the GUS Pension Scheme investments at the year end and is a weighted average of the expected returns on each main asset type based on the market yields available on these asset types at the year end.
The main asset types held by the GUS Pension Scheme expressed as a percentage of total assets and their expected returns are as follows: Asset Asset allocation at Expected allocation at Expected 31 March return for the 31 March return for the 2006 next year 2005 next year %%%% Equities 67% 7.9% 67% 8.0% Fixed and index linked income securities 30% 4.6% 31% 5.1% Other 3% 3.7% 2% 3.7% Total 100% 6.8% 100% 7.0% The IAS 19 valuation assumes mortality will be in line with standard tables known as PMA92C2004 for males and PFA92C2004 for females.
An allowance is also made for anticipated future improvements in life expectancy, by assuming that the probability of death occurring at each age will decrease by 0.25% each year.
Overall, the average expectation of life on retirement in normal health is assumed to be: 18.9 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 65: 22.0 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 65: 19.6 years at age 65 for a male currently aged 50: and 22.9 years at age 65 for a female currently aged 50.
