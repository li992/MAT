Indemnity Provision In 1991 the Company acquired an investment in Newmont Mining and at the same time effected a disposal of its indirect interest in Cavenham Forest Industries Inc CFI.
As part of these arrangements the Company indemnified the purchaser of CFI against certain ongoing costs being incurred by that company.
The relevant indemnified costs are expected to be incurred between 2006 and 2027 and the indemnity provision has been based on the Companys share of the projected costs.
Investment Provision The Company owns several investments which were acquired under arrangements whereby part of the profit eventually realised on their disposal would be paid to certain third parties.
The provision has been computed by reference to the carrying value of the underlying investments.
As at 31 March 2006, 0.3 million of this provision relates to the costs of certain individuals seconded from First Arrow Investment Management Limited 31 March 2005: nil.
It is expected that this provision of 0.3 million will be settled within the next twelve months.
Litigation As mentioned in note 27, litigation proceedings are in process against the Company relating to its investment in H-G Holdings Inc. A provision of 1 million has been recognised for the estimated legal costs of defending the action which are likely to be incurred over the next one or two years.
Property The Group has a short leasehold interest in a property which is being sub-let to a third party.
The net income receivable is less than the annual outgoings and, based on a professional valuation, the Group has recognised a provision of 250,000 as at 31 March 2006 31 March 2005: 250,000.

PROVISIONS FOR LIABILITIES AND CHARGES CONTINUED Long-term Incentive Plan This provision represents amounts accrued under a long-term incentive arrangement structured in the form of a Share Appreciation Rights Plan SAR.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, certain Directors and employees are entitled to a bonus calculated by reference to a notional number of shares in the Company.
The bonus amount payable would be equal to the increase, since the date of grant of the relevant SARs, in the Companys share price multiplied by the notional number of shares, provided the relevant performance conditions are met: the provision also includes the corresponding employers national insurance liability.
The SAR can be exercised between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant.
The provision can be analysed by reference to the date of grant of the relevant SARs as set out below: Restated 31 March 31 March 2006 2005 000 000 Date of grant 30 March 1999 4,724 22 March 2000 1,342 22 March 2002 110 26 March 2003 1,892 1,871 31 March 2003 441 247 12 August 2003 404 178 25 March 2004 153 42 30 March 2005 225 11 19 July 2005 672 30 August 2005 309 7 October 2005 50 17 March 2006 126 Intrinsic value of all SARs 4,272 8,525 Less: Adjustment required to compute the provision on the IFRS 2-basis 846 435 Carrying amount of SAR provision 3,426 8,090 Intrinsic value of those SARs which had vested as at 31 March 2,333 6,176 The Company has used a binomial option valuation model to estimate the fair value of the SARs.
The inputs to the model included the following: expected volatility of 14%, dividends of 3.1p per share per annum, contractual life of ten years, and a risk-free interest rate of 4.5%.
Expected volatility has been estimated based on relevant historic data in respect of RITCPs share price.
The vesting requirements are set out in detail in the section headed Long-term Incentive Plan in the Directors Remuneration Report on page 30.
To allow for the effects of early exercise, it was assumed that the majority of the SARs, in terms of value, would be exercised three and a half years after the relevant vesting dates.
During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Company granted 721,770 SARs 31 March 2005: 58,784 and the weighted average fair value of those SARs was 3.41 31 March 2005: 4.02.
The Company recognised total expenses of 7.235 million 31 March 2005: 3.181 million arising from the SAR long-term incentive plan.
