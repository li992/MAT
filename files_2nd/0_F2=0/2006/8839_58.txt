Long Term Incentive Scheme The Group introduced a Long Term Incentive Scheme LTIS in 2005.
Under this Scheme, the executive directors but not the Chairman and other key senior executives are awarded shares dependent upon the achievement of performance targets established by the Remuneration Committee.
The performance measures for the first cycle are operating pro t, return on capital employed and growth in the companys share price.
The share price performance measure applies to the executive directors only.
The awards are in the form of restricted shares and are deferred for two years from the award date.
On the assumption that 2006 actual performance is repeated in 2007, 7,100,669 shares are potentially issuable under the scheme.
Further details of the LTIS are provided in the Directors Remuneration Report.
