The mine was started on a conventional down dip mining method, common to the shallow mines in South Africa.
This method presents a number of safety challenges.
We successfully introduced a semi mechanised long hole stoping method with 25 degree apparent dip raises to replace the down dip panels on the upper levels.
On the lower levels mechanised down dip stoping is the preferred mining method.
Each sublevel is developed with a top drill drive and bottom drill drive on reef, using a single boom drill rig and a small LHD 6 tonnes.
Production long holes are drilled parallel between sublevels and four rings are blasted at a time.
Haulages and declines are developed with a twin-boom drill rig and large LHD to clean the face.
Broken ore is trucked to the shaft tips using 50 tonne trucks.
The diagram shows a 3D computerised design programme of how the longhole stoping method will be developed at Limpopo.

Careful planning was required to minimise the length of time the No.

A Furnace rebuild is always challenging given the extreme heat with which we have to deal and the length of time it takes for the vessel to cool down suf ciently for our employees to work safely inside.
In partnership with our key contractor on the project, ANMAR, the team were able to develop a schedule which allowed us to complete the rebuild in just 27 days matte tap to matte tap some five days ahead of our original plan.

Various other non-commercial aspects were also considered in the adjudication process and a final recommendation was drawn up to award the Fuels business to Masana Petroleum Solutions and the Lubrication business to Shell.
Bene ts of the auction include: 135% increase in fuel rebate: 24.9% reduction in lubrication costs: and 22% standardisation on lubrication commodities.
