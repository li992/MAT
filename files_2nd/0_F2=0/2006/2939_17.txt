In respect of IFRIC 12, Service concessions, which has not yet been endorsed by the EU, the Group has continued to recognise the FRS 5 Reporting the substance of transactions finance debtors relating to concession arrangements held by PPP jointly controlled entities at amortised cost as defined by IAS 39.
FRS 5 fixed assets relating to concession arrangements are accounted for in accordance with IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment.
The effect of adopting this policy is to maintain the accounting within PPP jointly controlled entities in line with existing UK GAAP with the exception of the treatment of interest rate derivatives under IAS 39, whilst ensuring that the accounting treatment complies with existing IFRS.
The Group does not expect the change in accounting policy to have a significant effect when the interpretation becomes mandatory in 2008.

In the absence of any identified impairment risk, tests were performed by Carillion plc based on internal valuations of each cash generating unit.
The recoverable amount of the goodwill attaching to cash-generating units is based on value in use calculations using discounted cash flows.
Those calculations use cash flows based on three year business plans and forecasts and a perpetual growth rate of 5% thereafter, discounted at the Groups estimated weighted average cost of capital of 9.5%.
As at 31 December 2006, based on internal valuations, Carillion plc management concluded that the recoverable value of the cash generating units tested significantly exceeded their carrying amount.
Amortisation charge The amortisation charge of 17.8m 2005: 4.0m is recognised in administrative expenses in the income statement.
Amortisation of the intangible asset of 119.0m arising on the acquisition of Mowlem plc will be 79% complete by 2016.
The remaining amortisation charge is incurred over the following 25 years.

The Group, in the normal course of its construction activities, is the subject of certain legal proceedings.
The resolution of these proceedings is regarded as unlikely to succeed or to have a material effect on the Groups financial position.
Financial instruments Financial risk management Financial risk management is an integral part of the way the Group is managed.
In the course of its business, the Group is exposed primarily to foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.
The overall aim of the Groups financial risk management policies is to minimise potential adverse effects on financial performance and net assets.
The Groups treasury department manages the principal financial risks within policies and operating parameters approved by the Board of Directors.
Treasury is not a profit centre and does not enter into speculative transactions.
Foreign currency risk The Group operates in a number of overseas regions, primarily Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean.
In order to protect the Groups balance sheet from the impact of foreign exchange rate volatility, foreign currency denominated net assets of overseas operations that exceed 10m equivalent are hedged, as a minimum, at least 50% of the net asset value.
Net investment hedging is achieved through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Group policy is to recognise gains and losses from the effective portions of the hedges in equity and to recognise ineffective portions immediately in the income statement.
Profits arising within overseas operations are not hedged unless it is planned to make a distribution.
Such distributions are then treated as currency transactions and hedged accordingly.
The Group has small and infrequent transactional foreign currency exposures that are hedged using forward contracts as described above.
Interest rate risk The Groups interest bearing debt is predominantly sterling borrowings to finance the acquisition of Mowlem plc and short term working capital requirements and foreign currency denominated borrowings for hedging net assets of overseas operations.
Such borrowings are subject to floating rates of interest linked to LIBOR.
No interest rate hedging is currently undertaken by the Groups subsidiaries.
However, a number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate swaps.
Liquidity risk The Groups policy on liquidity risk is to ensure that sufficient cash is available to fund ongoing operations without the need to carry significant net debt over the medium term.
The Groups principal borrowing facilities are provided by a group of core relationship banks in the form of syndicated and bi-lateral loans and short-term overdraft facilities.
The quantum of committed borrowing facilities available to the Group is reviewed regularly and is designed to exceed forecast peak gross debt levels.
Credit risk Credit risk arises on financial instruments such as trade receivables, short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging.
Policies and procedures exist to ensure that customers have an appropriate credit history.
Short-term bank deposits and foreign currency hedging transactions are executed only with highly credit-rated authorised counterparties based on ratings issued by the major rating agencies.
Counterparty exposure positions are monitored regularly so that credit exposures to any one counterparty are within predetermined limits.

Financial instruments continued Overall, the Group considers that it is not exposed to a significant amount of credit risk.
Derivative financial instruments 2006 2005 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Forward foreign currency contracts 0.8 0.3 In addition to the above, a number of the Groups PPP jointly controlled entities have entered into interest rate derivatives as a means of hedging interest rate risk.
Interest bearing debts and the associated interest rate derivatives within these PPP jointly controlled entities are without recourse to the Group.
At 31 December 2006 the Groups share of the total net fair value liability of interest rate derivatives in PPP jointly controlled entities amounted to 27.8m 2005: 45.1m of which 13.7m 2005: 15.5m and the related deferred tax asset of 4.1m 2005: 4.7m has been recognised in the hedging reserve.

The foreign exchange gain of 4.1m 2005: 4.0m loss on translation of the borrowings into sterling has been recognised in the translation reserve.

Disposals in 2006 During the acquisition of Mowlem plc, certain businesses were identified as being non-core operations for disposal.
In addition, there were a number of businesses which had been identified as available for sale by Mowlem plc prior to acquisition.
In the post acquisition period the Group disposed of the following Mowlem plc businesses: Edgar Allen Limited Charter Builders Ltd Mowlem Environmental Sciences Group Barclay Mowlem Limited Carillion Energy Limited formerly Mowlem Energy Limited Carillion Utility Services Limited formerly Mowlem Utility Services Limited These businesses were included in the acquisition balance sheet of Mowlem plc as assets and liabilities held for sale and were therefore carried at fair value, which represents proceeds on disposal less costs to sell.
These fair values were realised on subsequent disposal and consequently no profit or loss has arisen.
The cash effect has been reflected in the Group cash flow statement as follows: m Consideration received net of disposal costs paid 53.5 Cash in businesses disposed of 23.1 Cash inflow from disposal of businesses 30.4 In September 2006, the Group disposed of a portfolio of equity investments in Public Private Partnership jointly controlled entities.

79 Carillion plc Section 07 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Financial Statements 31.
Retirement benefit obligations continued The market values of the schemes assets, which are not intended to be realised in the short term, may be subject to significant change before they are realised.
The present values of the schemes liabilities are calculated by reference to the investment return on Grade AA corporate bonds.
The assumptions used do not necessarily represent the investment return that may be achieved.
For all schemes the mortality basis is in line with the basis used by the respective Trustee at the last valuation.
All the schemes, except the Railways Pension Scheme, have adopted a basis using the medium cohort tables on the recommendation of the Scheme Actuary.
The Railways Pension Scheme uses scheme specific assumptions based on industry experience.
The Carillion Staff Scheme, the Carillion Public Sector Scheme, the Mowlem Staff Scheme and the Mowlem 1993 Scheme adopted the PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 years table for non-retired members mortality and the PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 years for retired members mortality at the last valuation.
The previous bases were PA92 Base 3 years and PA92 Base 1 year respectively.
The life expectancies for a male aged 65 are shown below.
2006 2005 PA92 YOB 1965 mc 2 yrs PA92 Base 3 yrs Non-retired members 21.3 years 19.4 years PA92 YOB 1935 mc 2 yrs PA92 Base 1 yr Retired members 19.7 years 17.8 years The Canadian Actuary annually undertakes an actuarial valuation and accounting exercise for reporting on local employee benefits under the local GAAP, CICA 3461.
The same assumptions have been used for local medical and dental inflation rates in relation to the Post Retirement Benefit Plan.
The immediate trend rate is 8.0% per annum with an ultimate trend rate of 5.0% per annum 2010.
An increase of 1.0% in the valuation trend would increase liabilities by 0.6m and the total service cost by 0.06m.
A decrease of 1.0% in the valuation trend would reduce liabilities by 0.5m and total service cost by 0.04m.
The overall expected rate of return on assets is determined by reference to local long term interest rates, the yield on gilts or Treasury stock and the Actuarys recommendation on the allowance for the potential long term extra return from investing in equities.

Accounting estimates and judgements Management has discussed with the Audit Committee the development, selection and disclosure of the Groups critical accounting policies and estimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below: Construction contracts In determining the revenue and costs to be recognised each year for work done on construction contracts, estimates are made in relation to final out turn on each contract.
Management continually review estimated final out turn on contracts and make adjustments where necessary.
Intangible assets In determining the fair value of identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of businesses acquired, judgement is required in relation to final out turn on construction contracts, discount rates and expected future cash flows and profitability.
Determining whether intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the future cash flows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit to which the intangible assets are attached.
Note 12 provides details of the carrying value of intangible assets.
Defined benefit pension scheme valuations In determining the valuation of defined benefit pension scheme assets and liabilities, a number of key assumptions have been made.
The key assumptions, which are given below are largely dependent on factors outside the control of the Group: Expected return on plan assets Inflation rate Mortality Discount rate Salary and pensions increases Details of the assumptions used are included in note 31.
