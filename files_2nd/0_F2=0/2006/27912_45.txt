RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 31 March 2004 and updated to 30 September 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The service cost has been calculated using the Projected Unit method.
As a result of the Plan being closed to new entrants, the service cost will increase as the members of the Plan approach retirement.
