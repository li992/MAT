The nature of the groups operations and its principal activities are set out in the directors report on page 22.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: Accounting periods commencing after International Accounting Standards IAS IFRSs IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 39 Fair Value Option 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendments to IAS 39 Transition and Initial Recognition of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities day 1 Profits 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Cash Flow Hedge Accounting 1 January 2006 IAS 39 Amendment to IAS 39 and IFRS 4 Financial Guarantee Contracts 1 January 2006 IAS 21 Amendments to IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Net Investment in a Foreign Operation 1 January 2006 International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 May 2006 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives 1 June 2006 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have a material impact on the financial statements of the group in the period of initial application.
2 Significant accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS for the first time.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted for use in the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given on pages 65 to 72.
As permitted by the transitional rules on first-time adoption of IFRS, the 2005 statutory comparatives have not been prepared in accordance with IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, but instead follow applicable UK GAAP requirements.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis as modified to include the fair valuation of certain financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Intermediate Capital Group PLC 43 Notes to the accounts Continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the company and its principal subsidiaries made up to 31 March.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
c Investment in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries are recorded in the company balance sheet at cost less provisions for impairments.
d Interest income and expense Interest income and expense on financial assets and liabilities held at amortised cost are measured using the effective interest rate method, which allocates the interest income or interest expense over the relevant period.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments or receipts through the expected life of the financial instrument.
e Fee income and expense Fees and commissions are generally recognised on an accruals basis when the service has been provided and include fund management fees and arrangement fees.
Fees integral to the loan yield, including underwriting and agency fees, are included within interest income as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Fees payable on the arrangement of balance sheet funding are included within interest expense as part of the effective interest rate calculation.
Other fees are generally expensed as incurred.
f Dividend income Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders rights to receive payment have been established.
g Share-based payments The group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unexercised at 1 February 2004.
The group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees.
These are measured at fair value at the date of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The fair value is expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will ultimately vest.
h Pension costs Pension liabilities are provided by payments to insurance companies or to individuals for employees private pension plans.
The amount charged to the income statement represents a percentage of the current payroll cost paid to defined contribution schemes.
i Value added tax Irrecoverable VAT is written off on items of expenditure relating to the income statement.
VAT on tangible fixed assets is capitalised and written off over a similar period to the asset to which it relates.
j Foreign currencies The individual financial statements of each group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.
For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each group company are expressed in pounds sterling which is the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.
The assets and liabilities of the groups foreign operations are translated using the exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
The income and expense items are translated using the exchange rates at the date of the transactions.
44 Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2 Significant accounting policies continued Foreign currency monetary transactions are translated into sterling using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are re-translated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Exchange differences on the retranslation of monetary items are recognised in the income statement for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the group enters into forward contracts.
The management policies of the group are described in more detail in note 28. k Taxation Provision is made for taxation at the current enacted rates on taxable profits, arising in income or in equity, taking into account relief for overseas taxation where appropriate.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full for all temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability for accounting purposes and its carrying amount for tax purposes.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered.
l Property, plant and equipment and depreciation Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Furniture and Equipment 20% 33% per annum Leasehold Premises 20% per annum m Financial assets Financial assets are classified into the following categories, as determined at initial recognition: i Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss Derivatives, which include warrants and other derivatives held for risk management purposes, are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges, see notes 2 o and 2 q below.
There are no assets that have been designated as fair value through profit or loss.
ii Loans and receivables Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They include loans made as part of the Groups operating activities as well as trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents.
iii Available-for-sale Available-for-sale assets are financial assets not classified in i or ii above and include listed bonds and listed and unlisted shares, see note 2 o below.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised and subsequently measured at fair value with gains or losses arising from changes in fair value recognised in the income statement.
Available-for-sale assets are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs.
They are subsequently measured at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair value included as a separate component of equity until the sale or impairment, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement.
Translation differences on monetary items are recognised in the income statement.
Loans and receivables are initially recognised at fair value including direct and incremental transaction costs and subsequently valued at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, see note 2 d above.
Intermediate Capital Group PLC 45 Notes to the accounts Continued 2 Significant accounting policies continued n Impairment of financial assets A financial asset is impaired and impairment losses are incurred if, and only if, there is objective evidence of a fall in value of that asset as a result of events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset and that loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash flows.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortised cost has occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets effective interest rate.
If there is objective evidence of impairment for financial assets classified as available for sale, the loss is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
o Shares and warrants Shares and warrants are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different basis, applying the valuation policies of ICG.
p Financial liabilities All financial liabilities, except for derivatives, are initially recognised at fair value less transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derivative liabilities are categorised as at fair value through profit or loss unless they are designated as hedges, see note 2 q below.
q Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting Derivatives, including embedded derivatives which are not considered to be closely related to the host contract, are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into, and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value.
Derivatives can be designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.
i Cash flow hedges A cash flow hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in cash flows, such as variable rate financial assets and liabilities.
The effective portion of changes in the derivative fair value is recognised in equity, and recycled to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
The fair value gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
ii Fair value hedges A fair value hedge is used to hedge exposures to variability in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, such as fixed rate loans.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised to the income statement over the period to maturity.
If derivatives are not designated as hedges then changes in fair values are recognised immediately in the income statement.
3 Profit of parent company As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the income statement of the parent company is not presented as part of these financial statements.
The parent companys retained profit for the financial period amounted to 98.2m year ended 31 January 2005 26.4m.

This is included in interest payable in the statutory income statement.
It is not considered part of core income as it relates to movement in the fair value of derivatives used to hedge certain liabilities of the group excluding any interest accruals and spot F X-translation movements on the derivatives which remain within interest payable.
5 Business and geographical segments For management purposes, the group is currently organised into two distinct business groups.
One of these being the provision of mezzanine finance and the other being fund management.

As these instruments are all held in private companies with no ready market, the events to crystallise such a valuation include the sale of shares by a substantial shareholder or the approach of an exit to the transaction, either by way of a float or a sale.
Therefore, the fair valuing of such unquoted shares has been restricted to those instruments whose value may be reliably measured by one of the above events.
These instruments are otherwise held at cost.
Other derivatives include interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts used to economically hedge the net exposure of the group.

These estimates take into account the level and quality of the customers earnings, the amount and sources of cash flows, the industry in which the customer operates and the likelihood of cash recovery.
Estimating the quantum and timing of these future proceeds involves significant judgement.
The actual amount of future cash flows and the date they are received may differ from these estimates and consequently actual losses incurred may differ from those recognised in the financial statements.

Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market price of the Companys shares on the date of the grant.
The vesting period is three years.
If the options issued under the Intermediate Capital Group Executive Share Option Scheme 1994, the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Approved Executive Share Option Scheme and the Intermediate Capital Group PLC 2001 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
If the options issued under the Intermediate Capital Group Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme 1997, remain unexercised after a period of 7 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest, except in cases of retirement.
Options are not exercisable unless, during any period of three consecutive financial years, the companys earnings per share increases by an average rate of at least 4% per annum above the Retail Price Index.

Intermediate Capital Group PLC 59 Notes to the accounts Continued 28 Financial assets and liabilities a Treasury and hedging policies The groups financial instruments include loans and investments and related trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
In addition, the groups financial instruments include borrowings in the form of bank debt, securitisation notes and private placements.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the groups operations.
The group enters into derivatives transactions principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts to manage the interest rate and currency risks arising from the groups operations and its sources of finance.
The group has not adopted hedge accounting for these derivatives and gains and losses on these derivatives have been recognised in the income statement.
The main risks arising from the groups financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.
It is the groups policy to match foreign currency loans and related net interest income, wherever possible, through either borrowing in the same foreign currency or entering into equivalent forward foreign exchange contracts.
The groups policy is to manage its exposure to interest rate movements present or future, actual or contingent so as to protect its net interest income over time.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies have remained unchanged since the companys flotation in 1994. b Interest rate risk The groups main activity is to provide mezzanine finance to its borrowers at both fixed and floating rates in any freely traded currency.
The group finances its operations by a mixture of retained profits, bank borrowings, private placements and floating rate notes.
The group borrows in currencies at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps in order to match the interest profile of its assets and to manage the groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
As a result, the group does not have material financial exposure to interest rate movements.
The following table provides a summary of the interest rate repricing profile of the Group and Company financial assets and financial liabilities as at 31 March 2006.
Assets and liabilities have been allocated to time bands by reference to the earlier of the next interest reset date and the contractual maturity date.
The table takes account of derivatives whose effect is to alter the interest basis of assets and liabilities.

Intermediate Capital Group PLC 61 Notes to the accounts Continued 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued c Foreign exchange risk Over one half of the portfolio of the group is in currencies other than sterling which gives rise to revenues in those currencies.
In order to protect the groups sterling balance sheet from the movements in these currencies and the sterling exchange rate, the group finances its loans and investments by means of borrowings in the respective currency and by way of forward foreign exchange contracts.
As a result, the group does not have material financial exposure to foreign exchange gains or losses.

Due to the longterm nature of the groups assets, the groups policy is that, wherever possible, the majority of its debt should mature in more than five years.
This has been achieved by using a combination of private placements with maturities of between five and ten years, by short-term borrowings under a five year extendible, multi-currency bank facility and other further syndicated and bilateral facilities and by issuing floating rate notes with a maturity date in 2021.
The maturity profile of the groups financial liabilities is shown within note 21. e Credit risk ICG has a policy to diversify its portfolio in terms of geography, sector and size and has in place disciplined credit procedures both before and during the period of investment to protect its portfolio.
The carrying amount of financial assets before any impairments best represents both the Group and Companys maximum credit risk exposure at the balance sheet date.
Additional information on the concentrations of credit risk are provided by industry and country on page 18.

The total carrying amount of these instruments is 100.7m.
The fair value of these instruments cannot be reliably measured.
The range of estimates within which the aggregate fair value is highly likely to lie is 50m 125m.
Intermediate Capital Group PLC 63 Notes to the accounts Continued 28 Financial assets and liabilities continued f Fair value continued Apart from the unlisted shares and warrants, the following methods and assumptions that were used to estimate the fair values are shown below: Loans and receivables Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method, less provisions for impairment.
This value is considered by the Directors to be a good approximation for fair value.
Available for sale investments and warrants Fair value is based on quoted prices, where available.
Where quoted prices are not available, the fair value is based on the Directors valuation which takes into account latest information from the company otherwise held at cost.
Other derivatives The fair value of the over-the-counter derivatives is derived from pricing models which take account of the contract terms, including maturity as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates and volatilities.
Revolving credit facility, private placements and secured notes Floating rate loans are recorded in the balance sheet using the effective interest rate method.
The fair value of fixed rate loans is calculated by discounting expected future cash flows on these instruments at current market interest rates.
Other financial assets and liabilities Due to their short term nature, the Directors consider the carrying value to be a good approximation of fair value.
