Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equitysettled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
biz 75 1 Accounting policies continued Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments are always measured at fair value, with hedge accounting employed in respect of those derivatives fulfilling the stringent requirements for hedge accounting as prescribed Assets held under leases under the standard.

Foreign currencies Cumulative average rates of exchange ruling during the year have been used to translate the income statements of overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates from their functional currency.
Transactions which do not take place in an entitys functional currency are converted at the spot rate.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated from their functional currency at balance sheet exchange rates.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures and associates are translated at rates ruling at the balance sheet date from their functional currency.
Differences on translation arising from changes in the sterling value of overseas net assets, related foreign currency loans, foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps at the beginning of the financial accounting year, or at the date of any later capital currency conversions, together with the differences between income statements translated at average rates and at balance sheet rates, are shown as a movement on reserves and in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Other exchange rate differences are dealt with in the income statement for the year.
Dividends Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company declared during the year are recognised directly in equity.
Interim dividends are recognised when paid.
biz 77 2 Segmental analysis The groups primary segments are the trading operations of North America, UK, Australia, Asia Pacific and Continental Europe.
These operations are organised and managed separately according to the geographic location of their assets and economic environment.
There are no significant transactions occurring between the primary segments.
There are two secondary business segments, Aggregates and Building Products.
The major products for each secondary segment, which differ slightly between countries, are as follows: Aggregates crushed rock and sand and gravel, asphalt, cement and ready-mixed concrete.
Building products bricks, concrete pipe and products, concrete flooring, precast concrete and roofing tiles.
Hansons business operations, as shown below, are managed using a combination of primary and secondary structures in eight distinct segments, including the corporate office and related costs that are described as Central.

Details of each of the employee share plans in place are given below and where applicable in the Remuneration report.
Long Term Incentive Plan The group operates a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP under which awards of shares are made, on a conditional basis, subject to performance measurements over a three year period.
The vesting of 50% of each award is dependent on total shareholder return TSR achieved by Hanson, measured by reference to a comparator group of companies.
As relative TSR is defined as a market condition, a Monte Carlo simulation model has been applied.
Further details in relation to the TSR measurement are provided in the Remuneration report.
The remaining 50% of each award is dependent on non-market conditions and has therefore been valued using a Black-Scholes model.
For the 2006 award, 25% is dependent on cash flow growth performance and 25% is dependent on earnings per share growth performance, whereas previous awards are dependent on an economic value added measure as the non-market condition.
Awards are equity settled and where the performance measurement targets are attained in part or in full, vested shares are distributed to LTIP participants as soon as practicable after the end of the performance period.
The expense recognised in the income statement in the year from the LTIP is 9.9m 6.1m, 4.1m.
Conditional awards were made over 2,387,057 ordinary shares on May 2, 2006 which will vest, subject to the performance measurement targets being attained, on May 2, 2009.
The weighted average fair value of each share award granted is 5.01 3.45, 3.01.
The fair value of total awards granted during the year is 12.0m 10.8m, 10.9m.

No options were granted during 2006 and no further grants of options will be made under this plan, the last grant having been made in 2005.
Under the plan participants were granted options over a number of shares subject to the achievement of performance targets over a three year performance period.
50% of the option grant is dependent on TSR performance measure and therefore valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model.
The remaining 50% of the option grant is dependent on an economic value added measure which has been valued using a Black-Scholes model.
Options which have vested will ordinarily remain exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant and are settled by the issuance of equity once exercised.
The expense recognised in the income statement in the year from the Share Option Plan is 0.6m 0.6m, 0.4m.
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices of, and movements in, shares under option during the year under the plan.
Options are granted at a discount of up to 20% of the market price at the date of invitation to participate over three, five or seven year savings contracts and options are exercisable during the six month period following completion of the savings contract.
Options are valued using a Black-Scholes model.
During 2006, options were granted over 837,502 shares which will ordinarily be exercisable at an exercise price of 611.0p per share during the period: June 1 to November 30, 2009 for the three year savings contract: June 1 to November 30, 2011 for the five year savings contract: and June 1 to November 30, 2013 for the seven year savings contract.
The weighted average fair value of each share under option granted is 1.81 1.34, 1.43.

There were no options granted under the Share Option Plan during 2006.
The expected volatility for Hanson has been calculated using historical data over a term commensurate with the expected life of each award option.
The expected volatility figures used in the valuations were calculated based on the following principles: Historic weekly volatility over periods of increasing length ending on the date of each grant award were determined.
The volatility figures above were used to calculate a weighted average volatility for the term commensurate with the expected term of the award option being valued.
Other Schemes Hanson also has an HM Revenue & Customs approved Executive Share Option Scheme.
No further grants of options will be made under this scheme.
Hanson also had Executive Share Option Schemes A and B which are now closed.
The options granted under the Share Option Schemes A and B were deemed to be cash-settled and consequently grants that had not been settled by January 1, 2005 have been accounted for under IFRS 2.
Options were granted with an exercise price equal to market value and remained exercisable at any time up to 10 years from the date of grant.
No performance conditions applied to the right to exercise the options granted under either scheme.
At December 31, 2006 there are no options outstanding under the Executive Share Option Schemes A and B and as a result the carrying amount of the liability relating to the cash-settled options at December 31, 2006 is nil nil, 0.4m.

An impairment charge of 0.2m resulted from the closure of three individual operating sites within Aggregates UK.
The impairments have arisen due to the closure, or intended closure, of the sites and are based on the recoverable amount of the assets.
Impairment charges totalling 0.2m against individual operating sites within Aggregates UK have been reversed, as proceeds from the sale of the sites exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision.
The main class of assets affected by each of the impairment charges and reversals is property, plant and equipment.
Impairments during 2005: A net impairment charge of 4.0m was recognised in 2005.
An impairment charge of 16.5m was recognised against goodwill held in Aggregates North America Southwest region.
The impairment, which reduced the goodwills carrying value to its value in use at discount rates provided below, resulted from a change in the economic circumstances of that operation.
An impairment provision of 14.9m recorded against property, plant and equipment in years prior to 2005, in Aggregates North America West region, was reversed in 2005.
The original charge resulted from significant uncertainty over the assets ability to generate future profitability, due to the lack of an economic supply of raw materials.
The supply was secured in 2005, removing this uncertainty and improving the projected cash flows generated by these assets.
An impairment charge of 5.3m was recognised in 2005 against goodwill and property, plant and equipment at various individual operating sites within Aggregates UK.
These tangible assets are cash generating units for the purpose of measuring impairment, as they generate largely independent cash flows.
The impairments arose due to the closure, or intended closure of the sites, on commercial grounds and were based on the recoverable amount of the assets.
Impairment charges totalling 4.7m against individual operating sites within Aggregates UK were reversed, as anticipated proceeds from the sale of the site and business exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision.
Property, plant and equipment of 1.2m located in Spain and goodwill amounting to 0.6m in the Czech Republic were impaired in 2005, as these assets were not expected to generate a value in use equal to their carrying value.
Both of these cash generating units comprise a part of Continental Europe.
biz 87 6 Operating impairments continued Impairments during 2004: A net impairment charge of 29.3m was recognised in 2004.
An impairment charge of 21.2m was recognised in 2004 against property, plant and equipment and other assets at various individual operating sites within Aggregates UK.
The impairments have arisen due to the closure, or intended closure of the sites, on commercial grounds and are based on the recoverable amount of the assets.
Impairment charges totalling 0.5m against individual operating sites within Aggregates UK have been reversed, as anticipated proceeds from the sale of the site and business exceeded their carrying values, net of the provision.
Assets in Asia Pacific and Continental Europe of 4.9m and 3.7m were impaired in 2004, as these assets were not expected to generate a value in use equal to their carrying value.
The main classes of assets affected by the impairment charges were property plant and equipment and goodwill.
Assumptions used for impairment testing: The recoverable amount for each cash generating unit is based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections based on four year forecasts approved by the Board of Directors excluding the impact of anticipated acquisitions, business improvement capital expenditure and restructuring.
Forecast replacement capital expenditure requirements are included within the first four years, after which capital expenditure is assumed to represent 100% of depreciation.
Subsequent cash flows beyond the initial four year forecast for all cash generating units are inflated by rates of 1.5% to 4.0% 0.7% to 4.9%, nil% to 4.0% including the US 4.0% 4.0%, 4.0%, UK 3.0% 3.0%, 2.5% and Australia 2.75% 2.5%, 2.5%.
Post-tax discount rates have been applied to post-tax cash flows.
The use of these rates results in recoverable values that are identical to the ones that would be obtained by using pre-tax rates and pre-tax cash flows, as required by IAS 36 Impairment of assets.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following key assumptions: Sales volumes Average selling prices Operating costs The sales volume assumptions are influenced by several factors including, end use market and demand drivers, our competitive position, quality of product and service, distribution and product selling price.
Historical sales volumes are used as the base.
These are either increased or decreased over the forecast period using assumptions derived from past experience or consistent with external sources of information.
Average selling price assumptions are influenced by several factors including end use market and demand drivers, our competitive position, site tenure, quality of product and service, distribution and product selling price.
Historical average selling prices are used as the base.
These are either increased or decreased over the forecast period using assumptions derived from past experience.
Operating cost assumptions are influenced by several factors including availability of product and service, supply and demand, scarcity of availability, and age and quality of plant and equipment.
Historical operating costs are used as the base.
Given the excess of value in use over the carrying amount for each cash generating unit, and the absence of any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions applied, the additional disclosures in IAS 36 Impairment of assets regarding the sensitivity of the value in use calculations are not warranted.
The principal risks and uncertainties of the business are disclosed in more detail on pages 52 to 54 of this document.
Where business segments include closed sites or sites that are to be closed, the anticipated proceeds less costs to sell have been used.

11 Earnings per ordinary share The basic earnings per ordinary share of 56.0p 53.2p, 36.0p is calculated by taking the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company of 400.4m 387.3m, 264.3m and dividing by the weighted average of ordinary shares in issue during the year, after deducting shares held in employee trusts or as treasury shares, of 715,285,833 728,300,283: 734,257,732.
The basic earnings per ordinary share of continuing operations of 55.9p 54.2p, 43.6p is calculated on earnings of 400.0m 394.6m, 320.3m and using the same number of shares referred to above.
Earnings per ordinary share is also calculated below, before impairments, as the Directors consider this as a useful indication of underlying performance.
The diluted earnings per ordinary share of 55.3p 52.6p, 35.6p is calculated by taking the profit attributable to equity holders of the Company as set out above and dividing by the basic number of shares adjusted for the notional vesting exercise of outstanding long-term incentive awards and options, where these would be deemed to have a dilutive impact.
At December 31, 2006 there are 787,281 nil, nil shares under option which are deemed to be anti-dilutive.

Asbestos Various of the Companys US subsidiaries are defendants, typically with many other companies, in lawsuits filed in state and federal courts by claimants who allege that they have suffered bodily injury as a result of exposure to asbestos-containing products, the manufacture of which by such subsidiaries ceased, depending on the subsidiary involved, between 1973 and 1984, which was prior to the time that these subsidiaries became members of the group.
Notes to the accounts Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 98 21 Provisions continued The discounted pre-tax provision for the gross cost of asbestos is shown above.
The related insurance asset is included within Receivables in note 17 and the deferred tax asset relating to asbestos payments is included within Deferred tax in note 22.
Claimant numbers and costs during the year Information regarding the movement in asbestos claimants in the year and the cost of resolution in the year is provided below: 2006 2005 2004 New claimants 6,350 10,350 18,700 Resolutions 30,100 14,750 7,150 Outstanding claimants 107,600 131,350 135,750 Average gross cost of resolution $ 1,811 2,929 8,294 Gross cost of resolution $m 54.5 43.2 59.3 Less insurance recoveries $m 3.4 11.5 46.5 Net cost before tax $m 51.1 31.7 12.8 New claimants in 2006 were approximately 6,350 10,350,18,700.
At the end of 2006, outstanding claimants totalled approximately 107,600 131,350, 135,750.
Of the 30,100 14,750, 7,150 claimants whose cases were resolved during 2006, over 90% were dismissed without payment.
In the USA, claimants can file without illness or product identification.
In the absence to date of federal reform, a number of states have introduced or are looking to introduce an unimpaired docket which will suspend claims until there is proven evidence of illness.
The gross cost of resolving asbestos claims in 2006 was $54.5m $43.2m, $59.3m including legal fees of $25.4m $26.3m, $27.4m.
The net pre-tax cost of asbestos for the year after insurance was $51.1m $31.7m, $12.8m, equivalent to a sterling cost of 16.9m after tax.
The aggregate amounts paid in settlement and average settlement payments in any given period, together with related defence costs, have fluctuated widely and are expected to continue to fluctuate widely depending on the nature of the claims resolved including the proportion of which that are mass claims, disease mix, number of other defendants and jurisdiction of claim.
Each of the Companys relevant US subsidiaries, together with its insurance carriers and outside counsel, review each asbestos claim that is pursued by claimants.
In many cases claimants are unable to demonstrate that any injury they have suffered resulted from exposure to the subsidiarys products, in which case their claim is generally dismissed without payment.
In those cases where a compensatable disease, exposure to the subsidiarys products and causation can be established by claimants, the subsidiary generally settles for amounts that reflect the type of disease, the seriousness of the injury, the age of the claimant, the particular jurisdiction of the claim and the number and solvency of the other defendants.
The Companys approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and reliably estimable.
The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities refer note 26.
At present, based on detailed analysis and the assumptions noted below, the provision for those costs which are both probable and reliably estimable equates to approximately eight years of gross cost, assuming an annual level of approximately $60m.
Whilst further claims are likely to be resolved beyond this eight year period, the associated costs of resolution are not able to be reliably estimated and hence no provision has been made to cover these possible liabilities.
Assumptions made in establishing the provision relate to the number, disease mix and location of future claimants, trends in dismissal rates, settlement and defence costs, resolution of all existing claimants, time scale of resolution of new claimants, the continued solvency of co-defendants and expected insurance recoveries.
In light of the significant uncertainty associated with asbestos claims, there can be no guarantee that the assumptions used to estimate the provision for the cost of resolving asbestos claims will be an accurate prediction of the actual costs that may be incurred and as a result the provision will be subject to potential revision from time to time as additional information becomes available and to reflect any changes in trends.
Gross cost provision The provision of $496.8m at January 1, 2006 was increased by $60.0m the estimated gross cost for an additional year and reduced by the gross cost incurred in 2006 of $54.5m, to give a closing provision at December 31, 2006 of $502.3m.
This represents the estimated gross cost of asbestos for the next eight years, and is equivalent to $398.7m on a discounted basis, or 203.7m.
biz 99 21 Provisions continued Insurance asset The insurance asset of $14.6m at January 1, 2006 was reduced by insurance utilisation during the year of $3.4m, on an undiscounted basis.
Most of the US subsidiaries involved with asbestos claims have had agreements with their respective insurance carriers regarding the defence and settlement of asbestos claims, the terms of which varied for each such subsidiary.
These insurance arrangements have resulted in the insurance companies having met substantially all of the amounts such subsidiaries have paid prior to 2006 in settlements and defence costs.
In 2006, most of these costs were borne by the relevant subsidiaries.
The amounts to be paid by the relevant subsidiaries in future years may vary, depending on litigation and negotiation with the relevant insurers.
On February 13, 2006, Hanson announced that one of its US subsidiaries, responsible for approximately 20% of the groups present asbestos costs, had reached a settlement with its insurers.
The settlement is effective from January 1, 2006 and resolves a number of issues relating to historic insurance policies which provided insurance cover for a range of claims, including those relating to asbestos.
Under the settlement, the subsidiary will pay the first $35.0m of its future asbestos costs, which the subsidiary estimates will be paid over approximately four years from January 1, 2006.
Thereafter the subsidiarys asbestos costs will be paid in full by the insurance carriers up to agreed limits.
These limits have not been disclosed as they are subject to a confidentiality agreement between the subsidiary and the insurance carriers.
These limits, assuming they are not utilised for non-asbestos claims, are expected to provide asbestos insurance cover for this subsidiary well beyond 2020.
The receivable recognised as a result of this settlement increased the insurance asset by $58.5m, or 23.0m on a discounted basis.
The closing insurance asset at December 31, 2006 is $89.7m, equivalent to 34.2m on a discounted basis as shown in note 17.
Certain other US subsidiaries, not party to the recent settlement, continue to pursue litigation and negotiation to maximise the insurance cover available.
Litigation proceedings are progressing in the state of California.
Deferred tax asset The net cost of asbestos is deductible for US taxation at an estimated rate of 39%.
At December 31, 2006, the deferred tax asset relating to the discounted asbestos provision, net of insurance, was 66.1m as shown in note 22.
Income statement The net impact on the income statement, shown under discontinued items in note 9, was a profit of 1.1m after tax.
This consists of a discounted charge after tax of 8.5m, as shown in the Provided column of the above table, plus the net impact of the discount unwind and change in discount rate which was a charge of 4.4m after tax as shown in the Discount column of the above table, less the new insurance of 14.0m.
Cash flow The net cash flow impact, shown within net cash inflow from operating activities, was a net cash outflow of 16.9m shown in the Utilised column of the above table.
Risk factors Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates include: i adverse trends in the ultimate number of claimants filing asbestos claims against the Companys US subsidiaries: ii increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement and or defence costs, dismissal rates, and or judgment amounts: iii increases or decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims: iv the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the number of potential claimants: v the impact of bankruptcies of other defendant companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Companys US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws: vi the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process: vii adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Companys US subsidiaries: and viii potential legislative changes.
In light of such factors, the costs of the Companys US subsidiaries involved in resolving asbestos claims may be materially different from current estimates and consequently might have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.
However, assuming that current trends continue, the Company does not expect that such costs will have such a material adverse effect and, even assuming a material deterioration in current trends, on the evidence available to it, the Company does not expect that such claims would impact the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern.
Koppers liabilities Koppers environmental obligations and related costs arise primarily from the US chemical and related operations formerly operated by Koppers Company Inc, a company acquired by Beazer PLC, which itself was acquired by the Company in 1991.
Members of the Beazer group remain contractually and statutorily liable for certain environmental costs relating to these discontinued operations.
During 1998 an agreement was signed under which, for a one-off premium and related transaction costs totalling $275.0m, insurance cover of $800.0m in perpetuity after payment by members of the Beazer group of the first $100.0m of remediation costs arising since January 1, 1998 was provided by subsidiaries of two reinsurance companies, Centre Solutions and Swiss Re.
At the end of 2006, $467.9m of the $800.0m insurance cover had been utilised.
The estimate of future probable cost, discounted at 5.9% 5.3%, 5.1%, is shown as a provision of 104.9m at December 31, 2006.
These costs are the responsibility of the insurers and hence a receivable of 104.9m is recorded at December 31, 2006 as shown in note 17.
Based upon existing known circumstances, the Company considers that the remaining $332.1m of insurance cover is expected to meet the related future costs, recognising that the estimate of future probable costs could increase and new sites may arise to which the insurance cover does not apply.
Factors which could cause such remediation costs to increase include i unknown adverse conditions arising at sites: ii third party claims in excess of estimates: iii changes to regulatory requirements: iv changes in remediation techniques: and v any other significant variations to assumptions made in support of these estimates.
Other provisions Long-term provisions have been discounted at rates of up to 7.1% 6.25%.
Reclamation obligations have been established to cover those situations where members of the group have either a legal or constructive obligation to carry out remedial works.
Reclamation provisions are expected to be utilised over the life of the relevant site.
Legal, insurance, environmental and other provisions relate to acquisitions, disposals and rationalisations both arising on acquisitions and provided for in current and prior years.
Legal, insurance, environmental and other provisions are expected to be utilised on a reducing basis over the next five years, depending in each case on the nature of the underlying obligation.
Where appropriate, reclamation and environmental provisions have been established after taking into account the opinions of suitably qualified and experienced consultants and after estimating the costs in line with current practice and standards.
Notes to the accounts 100 Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 22 Tax payable receivable and deferred tax a Tax payable receivable Current and non-current tax payable receivable represents expected taxes payable receivable for tax filings in respect of current and prior years that exceed payments made and received.
It also includes provisions for potential adjustments by tax authorities with respect to tax filings.
Examination of tax filings by tax authorities may last several years beyond the year of filing.
At any given time, the group is undergoing tax audits in several tax jurisdictions and covering multiple years.
The group has provisions for taxes that may become payable in future periods as a result of these tax audits.
The group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due.
Where the final outcome of these matters is different from the amounts provided, such differences will impact the tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
Interest on tax liabilities is accrued for in the tax charge and is included in the provisions.
The tax provisions are analysed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustments to the provisions.
The decrease is due to revisions to the best reasonable estimate of the tax exposures, cash paid on certain audits and foreign exchange movements on non UK provisions.

The group has a significant amount of capital and non-trading losses.
These can only be offset against certain types of income in particular legal entities, and no such income is currently envisaged.

The losses have no expiry date.
ii Other temporary differences At December 31, 2006 the group has other deductible temporary differences of 16.8m 20.8m for which deferred tax assets of 5.1m 6.4m have not been recognised because it is not probable that future taxable income will be available against which the group can utilise the benefits.
The deductible temporary differences do not expire under current tax legislation.
iii Unrecognised tax base The group has deductible temporary differences for which no tax benefit has been recognised related to certain additional tax attributes of property, plant and equipment located in the UK and Australia.
The amount of these deductible temporary differences at December 31, 2006 was 275.3m 288.9m.
These additional tax attributes have not been recognised because it is not probable that suitable profits will be available.
There is no expiry date for these differences.
iv Overseas subsidiaries At December 31, 2006, the group has not provided deferred tax in relation to temporary differences on its overseas subsidiaries, joint-ventures or associates.
Quantifying the temporary differences is not practical, however, based on current enacted law, and on the basis that the group can control the timing and realisation of these temporary differences, no material tax consequences are expected to arise.

The Trust waived its rights to dividends payable during the year and to future dividends on its holding of shares.
The cost of the Hanson Sharesave Scheme, where awards are granted at a discount to the market price of the Companys shares, Share Option Plan and the Long Term Incentive Plan is charged to the income statement.
During the year, the group contributed 14.2m 6.0m, nil to the Trust.
At December 31, 2006, 24,645,000 shares were held in treasury, none of which has the right to receive dividends.
No shares were purchased by the Company to be held in treasury during the period January 1 to February 19, 2007.
Pursuant to approval given by shareholders at the AGM held on April 26, 2006, as at December 31, 2006 the Company retains the authority to purchase a further 48,955,000 of its own shares up to the end of the AGM to be held on April 24, 2007.

The change in the fair value of derivatives in the cash flow hedge reserve in the period relates mainly to interest rate swaps with a maximum maturity date of 2013 hedging floating rate debt and commodity swaps with a maximum maturity date of 2007 hedging fluctuations in energy prices.
Underlying cash flows are therefore expected to occur until these dates.

The undistributed earnings of jointventures and associates are 45.3m 38.9m, 18.0m.
Other reserves Other reserves represent merger reserves on acquisition of Pioneer International Limited of 216.3m, and 756.1m created on the reduction of share capital through the Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act.
25 Business combinations Total cash consideration on acquisitions including acquisition costs for 2006 was 558.0m 342.9m.
During 2006, Building Products UK acquired the share capital of Red Bank Manufacturing, a producer of terracotta and clay products, on January 10 and Building Products North America acquired the share capital of PaverModule Inc. a concrete paving manufacturer, on January 20 for a total consideration for these acquisitions of 60.6m.
On March 2, Aggregates UK purchased the share capital of Civil and Marine Holdings Ltd, a leading producer of ground granulated blast furnace slag in the UK, with additional operations in the US and in the Czech Republic, for 248.1m.
Aggregates North America completed its acquisition of the share capital of Material Service Corporation, a leading aggregate materials producer in the USA, on June 16 for 166.3m.
The group completed a further five acquisitions of entities based in the UK, USA and Spain, along with seven assets acquisitions, primarily concrete plants and quarries, for a total consideration of 83.0m.
All acquisitions of share capital included the transfer of the entire voting rights to the group.
On January 4, 2005, Building Products UK acquired the share capital of UK brick manufacturer, Marshalls Clay Products, for 64.7m and of Thermalite, a market leader in aircrete blocks, on March 7 for 124.2m.
On June 17, Aggregates North America acquired the share capital of Mission Valley Rock, Berkeley Ready Mix and Berkeley Asphalt, and Building Products North America acquired the assets of Sherman Pipe, a concrete pipe and precast concrete products business, for a total consideration of 108.0m.
Other acquisitions made in the year consisted of three quarries in Southern Indiana by Aggregates North America in December, and a further six acquisitions totalling 46.0m.

This includes market share, as well as new market and product entry, and synergy benefits.
Of the total goodwill on current year acquisitions of 286.7m 190.1m, 12.5m 36.9m is deductible for tax purposes.
For the period since acquisition, turnover of 215.0m and operating profit before impairments of 47.9m in respect of the current year acquisitions is included within the income statement as continuing operations.
If the acquisitions had taken place at the beginning of the financial year, the continuing operating profit before impairments of the group would have been 557.3m 527.6m and turnover from continuing operations would have been 4,215.1m 4,048.9m.
The preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to net assets and liabilities will be reviewed based on additional information up to a year from the date of acquisition.
The Directors do not anticipate that any net adjustments resulting from such reviews will have a material effect on the financial position or results of Hansons operations.
In respect of acquisitions in 2005, there were no material subsequent amendments to the preliminary allocations made.
Notes to the accounts 104 Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 26 Contingent liabilities Litigation relating to certain discontinued operations Certain of the Companys US subsidiaries, either directly or as a result of indemnity obligations, are the subject of claims or lawsuits both on an individual and class action basis for bodily injury or property damage, relating to products incorporating asbestos, coal by-products and chemicals, in particular for the wood treating industry.
Asbestos The Companys approach to accounting for the asbestos claims against its US subsidiaries is to provide for those costs of resolution which are both probable and reliably estimable refer note 21.
The costs of resolving possible claims are disclosed as contingent liabilities.
Factors which could cause actual results to differ from these estimates include: i adverse trends in the ultimate number of claimants filing asbestos claims against the Companys US subsidiaries: ii increases in the cost of resolving current and future asbestos claims as a result of adverse trends relating to settlement and or defence costs, dismissal rates, and or judgement amounts: iii increases or decreases in the amount of insurance available to cover asbestos claims: iv the emergence of new trends or legal theories that enlarge the number of potential claimants: v the impact of bankruptcies of other defendant companies whose share of liability may be imposed on the Companys US subsidiaries under certain state liability laws: vi the unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process: vii adverse changes in the mix of asbestos-related diseases with respect to which asbestos claims are made against the Companys US subsidiaries: and viii potential legislative changes.
Details of asbestos claims against the Companys US subsidiaries and the Companys approach to provisioning and the associated contingent liabilities are detailed in note 21.
At December 31, 2006, approximately 107,600 claimants were outstanding.
The amounts of compensation formally claimed in the cases initially filed by these claimants vary but typically follow standard formulations that are used in various jurisdictions by various plaintiffs law firms.
Of the claimants outstanding as of December 31, 2006, Hanson estimates that approximately 36% do not specify a dollar claim for damages, approximately 57% claim an amount greater than $10,000 and approximately 7% specify various amounts, typically greater than specified amounts between $50,000 and $1m.
Hanson is not aware of any claim specifying an amount greater than $40m.
Hanson does not believe that the specific dollar amount mentioned in any claim is an accurate gauge of what relief, if any, the claimant may eventually recover from one of Hansons US subsidiaries, and most claimants fail to allocate their alleged claims of liability amongst the various named defendants.
Coal by-products and chemicals These claims and lawsuits relate primarily to former US chemical products and operations, in particular those relating to the wood treating and coal tar derivative industries: products and operations which are unrelated to the groups present business and activities.
In such cases where one of the Companys subsidiaries is involved, there are often several potential defendants named in the claim or lawsuit.
Since the final demerger in 1997 no settlements have been paid by, or judgments rendered against, any of the Companys subsidiaries which have had or could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow in connection with any such claims or lawsuits.
In a number of instances, the claim or lawsuit against the subsidiary has not been pursued and has been dismissed.
With respect to those claims or lawsuits that have been or are being pursued, the subsidiary concerned generally believes itself to have had or to have meritorious defences and such claims and lawsuits have been and are being vigorously defended.
The costs of defence and the amounts that are claimed by the plaintiffs, particularly in those lawsuits which involve numerous claimants, can be significant with claims amounting to tens of millions of dollars.
The unpredictable aspects of the US litigation process and the potential for juries to award punitive damages mean that there is a possibility that the Companys subsidiary may suffer at some stage a significant adverse verdict.
Insurance issues do arise on these claims and lawsuits, both in terms of settlement and defence coverage, the outcome of which can be uncertain.
In certain instances no insurance coverage may be available to the relevant subsidiary.
The insurance cover referred to in note 21 relating to the Koppers environmental obligations does not apply to the bodily injury claims and lawsuits described in this note, although it will address certain of the property damage claims.
The cost relating to these claims is shown in note 21.
Other litigation Several of the Companys US subsidiaries are subject to litigation in California courts arising out of sand dredging operations on submerged lands leased from the state of California.
The litigation involves allegations that these subsidiaries underpaid royalties due under the leases and that sand was dredged from state owned lands without authorisation.
The litigation includes claims by the state of California under California statutes providing for the recovery of treble damages and certain fines, penalties and attorney fees where the wrongful conduct involves false statements or conversion of state owned property.
A press release by the California Attorney General states that he is seeking damages of $200m, although the complaint actually filed in court does not specify the amount of damages sought.
The courts decision on a declaratory motion regarding the interpretation of the royalty provisions of the relevant leases has not served to clarify the situation.
The parties are now engaged in litigation on all matters arising out of the case.
In light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation, no assurances or predictions can be made on the outcome of this litigation.
Various subsidiaries of the Company are also the subject of a number of other pending legal proceedings.
The Company does not anticipate that the outcome of these proceedings, either individually or in aggregate, will have a material adverse effect upon the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
However, in light of the uncertainties involved in any litigation and in particular in the USA, where there is the added potential for punitive damage awards, there can be no guarantee that a settlement might have to be made by, or an unfavourable judgement may be rendered against, the Company or one of its subsidiaries, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flow in connection with the above mentioned non-asbestos claims and lawsuits.
biz 105 26 Contingent liabilities continued Demergers In connection with the demergers, each of the four companies into which the Company demerged its respective businesses agreed to indemnify the Company against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of the businesses transferred to it on its respective demerger while the Company agreed to indemnify each of these companies against, among other things, the past, present and future obligations and liabilities of all other businesses owned or previously owned by the Company including the businesses transferred to the other demerged companies.
Neither the Company nor any of its existing subsidiaries has incurred any liability in respect of a claim that related to the above-mentioned businesses demerged by the Company, any such liability being borne by the relevant demerged company without liability to the Company or any of its existing subsidiaries.
The Energy Group PLC, one of the demerged companies, was acquired by TXU Corp. in 1998.
In November 2002, TXU Corp. announced that several of TXU Corps UK subsidiaries had been placed under the administration process in the UK, including The Energy Group PLC.
The Energy Group PLC itself is therefore unlikely to be able to fulfil its indemnification obligations to the Company and its existing subsidiaries if and when required.
The Company is, however, not aware of any claims against it or its subsidiaries that would give rise to an indemnity obligation owed to the Company or its subsidiaries, on the part of The Energy Group PLC.
Bonds and guarantees As at December 31, 2006 the group had contingent liabilities of: 127.1m 111.7m, 97.8m in respect of bank guarantees and performance bonds given to third parties primarily relating to environmental and restoration obligations and the deductible element of insurance programmes, of which 0.2m 0.2m, 0.2m relates to former trading activities of the group: and 121.1m 99.7m, 81.6m in respect of surety bonds issued by US insurance companies in respect of reclamation liabilities of 50.2m 51.6m, 42.1m, performance bonds of 49.9m 38.0m, 31.2m and other surety obligations of 21.0m 10.1m, 8.3m.
Whilst the group holds provisions see note 21 for certain liabilities to which the bonds and guarantees relate, the liabilities under the bonds and guarantees are not directly recorded on the consolidated balance sheet.
27 Commitments Group as lessee: The future minimum rental commitments as at December 31, for finance leases and non-cancellable operating leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments under finance leases, are as follows: Operating leases Finance leases 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Within one year 24.6 31.1 1.1 0.4 After one year but not more than two years 21.1 25.9 0.8 0.2 After two years but not more than three years 16.9 21.7 0.8 After three years but not more than four years 13.6 16.8 0.6 After four years but not more than five years 12.0 14.8 0.3 After more than five years 123.3 128.5 0.4 Total minimum lease payments 211.5 238.8 4.0 0.6 Less amount representing finance charges 0.6 0.1 Present value of minimum lease payments 3.4 0.5 Future minimum sublease receivable 9.1 8.6 28 Pensions and other post-employment medical plans i Description of plans Hanson provides pension and post-employment medical plans in a number of countries in which it operates in accordance with local employment practices.
These arrangements have been subject to change in recent years and, with the exception of some arrangements covered under collective bargaining agreements in the US, new employees are no longer eligible for inclusion in either defined benefit pension plans DB plans or post-employment medical plans.
The liabilities of the groups DB plans primarily relate to pensioners currently in receipt of benefits, ex-employees with accrued rights to receive pensions in future and current employees who were members of DB plans before the relevant cut-off date, being July 2002 in the UK and July 2005 in the USA.
The group follows a policy of funding DB plans to a target of the accrued benefit obligation, a level which is higher than the statutory minimum funding level in each country.
Together with plan trustees, the group has a long term goal of matching the liabilities of the plans with appropriate assets.
The liabilities of the groups post-employment medical plans are primarily in the USA and Canada.
These comprise a number of separate arrangements which have been closed to new entrants over time such that the substantial part of the liabilities relates to retirees.
Post-employment medical liabilities are unfunded and are held as a balance sheet provision.
Where pension benefits are provided to new employees of the group, they are eligible to join defined contribution pension plans DC plans.
The group contribution to such plans is generally related to the employee contribution and ranges from 5-10% in the UK and 3-6% in the USA, in each case as a proportion of pensionable salary.
The group also participates in multi-employer pension plans, primarily in the USA.
These provide defined benefits to certain of the groups union employees.
Multi-employer pension plans are accounted for as DC plans as it is not possible to isolate the components of such plans which would collectively comprise the groups liability.
Notes to the accounts 106 Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 28 Pensions and other post-employment medical plans continued ii Details of cash contributions Contributions by the group to its pension plans totalled 73.9m 59.1m, 57.8m in the year, principally in the UK, USA and Canada.
This is represented by regular contributions of 30.3m 31.1m, 38.0m and additional contributions of 22.4m 12.1m, 8.4m to DB pension plans: contributions to DC plans of 15.5m 12.1m, 7.6m : and contributions to multi-employer plans of 5.7m 3.8m, 3.8m.
In addition to the ongoing regular contributions, group companies are scheduled to make additional payments to the principal UK DB plan of 8.4m in each of the next two years.
No conclusion has currently been reached on the level of contributions to other plans although, overall, the group expects to maintain its regular contributions at broadly the same level in 2007.
Contributions relating to multi-employer plans are based on negotiated collective bargaining agreements.
The surpluses and deficits in the multi-employer plans are not considered to have a material impact on the Company.
Benefits paid by the group in respect of its post-employment medical plans, totalled 10.4m 9.0m, 8.5m.

In the UK, the liabilities of the principal plan have a duration of 18.2 years.
The bond and similar assets of this plan, which are equivalent to 46.8% of that plans liabilities, have a duration of 16.5 years.
The asset category bond and similar assets includes bonds, investments in pooled funds of money market investments and interest rate swaps which, taken together, have the characteristics of a high quality bond portfolio and annuities.
In the USA, the liabilities of the principal plan have a duration of 10.6 years.
The bond assets of this plan, which are equivalent to 60.5% of that plans liabilities have a duration of 13.5 years.
Taken together, the liabilities of the principal plans in the UK and USA referred to above represent 82.7% of group pension liabilities.
The major categories of plan assets are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 % % % Equity 33.7 41.7 46.3 Bonds and similar assets 58.0 51.7 44.2 Property 6.1 5.0 4.5 Cash and other 2.2 1.6 5.0 Total 100.0 100.0 100.0 iv Assumptions In setting the discount rates for pension liabilities, Hanson has, together with its advisers, assessed the AA corporate bond yields for bonds of a similar duration to that of the liabilities of the principal plans.
To develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumptions, the group considered the current level of expected returns on risk-free investments primarily government bonds, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the portfolio is invested and the expectations for future returns of each asset class.
The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class was weighted based on the asset allocation to develop the expected long-term rate of return on assets assumption for the portfolio, resulting in weighted average assumptions of 5.55% for the UK and 6.30% for the USA at December 31, 2006.
The major assumptions used to determine the liabilities for the principal US and UK defined benefit plans are set out below: UK UK UK US US US 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 % % % % % % Discount rates at December 31 5.00 4.80 5.30 5.80 5.60 5.75 Future salary increases 4.50 4.25 4.50 4.25 4.25 4.25 Future pension increases 3.00 2.75 2.75 Inflation rate 3.00 2.75 2.75 2.50 2.50 2.50 Expected rate of return on plan assets: Equity 7.00 7.00 7.25 8.00 8.00 8.00 Bonds 4.50 4.50 4.60 5.50 5.50 5.50 Property 7.00 7.00 7.25 n a n a n a Cash and other 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 5.00 Weighted average expected return across plans 5.55 5.60 5.70 6.30 6.75 7.00 Over the past year, we have reviewed the mortality experience of the principal plans in the UK and the USA.
For the UK, these investigations concluded that the current mortality assumptions needed to be updated and the short cohort has been applied to the mortality tables used in retirement i. e. PA 90 rated down 5 years for current pensioners and PXA92 C 2014 for future pensioners.
In the USA, the mortality table RP-2000 projected to 2010 has been adopted in retirement for both current and future pensioners.
Further reviews will be undertaken in 2007 as part of the tri-annual actuarial valuation of the principal UK plan and the annual actuarial valuation of the US plan.

29 Financial risk management Exposure to liquidity, credit, and market price risk arises as a result of the day-to-day business activities of the group and the financing of those activities.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposures to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and energy prices.
a Funding and Liquidity Risk In addition to the high level of free cash flow of the group, Hanson operates a prudent approach to liquidity management using a mixture of long-term debt together with short-term debt, cash and investments to meet its liabilities when due.
This approach allows the group to respond quickly to strategic market opportunities as they arise.
The groups core funding is provided by three $750m bonds maturing in September 2010, March 2013 and August 2016 respectively.
In addition the group holds the following facilities: A 500m revolving credit facility, 470m of which expires in April 2011 and 30m of which expires in April 2010.
The facility contains a $947m swingline advance facility and a sub-limit of up to 300m for Australian dollar loan note advances.
A $475m syndicated credit facility expiring in July 2009.
This facility is available to be drawn as either cash advances or standby letters of credit.
Two A$200m bilateral revolving credit facilities maturing in September 2007.
A 100m bilateral revolving credit facility maturing in August 2007.
Committed bank facilities Expiring Remaining m m 2006 971.2 2007 228.5 742.7 2008 742.7 2009 242.7 500.0 2010 30.0 470.0 2011 470.0 b Credit Risk Credit risk represents the loss which Hanson would suffer if a counterparty failed to meet its contractual obligations.
This is an inherent risk in the day to day operations of the group.
The Boards policy for mitigating credit risk is to enter into financial transactions with counterparties with a AA3 credit rating for long-term transactions and F2 P-2 A2 for short-term transactions.
In addition, each counterparty and country are allocated limits for cash and short-term investments.
Cash deposits and investments have a maximum term of three months.
At December 31, 2006 there were no significant risk weighted concentrations of credit risk.
The maximum exposure under cash and short-term investments to a single counterparty at December 31, 2006 represented no more than 11% of group cash and short-term investments.
c Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from movements in market variables such as interest rates, exchange rates, and energy prices.
Market risk is incurred by Hanson as a result of borrowing to meet its financing obligations, by holding investments which earn interest, by operating in currencies other than sterling and by purchasing commodities as inputs into its operations.
Each of these risks is monitored by the relevant business unit and reviewed by senior management and or the group Risk Committee.
biz 109 29 Financial risk management continued i Interest rate risk The groups policy on interest rate risk is designed to limit the groups exposure to fluctuating interest rates.
This is achieved by limiting the level of floating interest rate exposure to a maximum determined by both the level of debt and the level of operating profit of the group at any point in time.
This approach, which is consistent with the groups target for leverage, will mean, other things being equal, that for any given level of debt, a higher level of operating profit will result in a higher limit on the level of floating rate debt in the group and vice versa.
Consistent with this policy, at December 31, 2006 the group held 63% of net debt at fixed rates.
Hanson uses interest rate swaps as part of fair value hedges, to swap fixed rate debt into floating rates and as part of cash flow hedges to swap floating rate debt into fixed rates, in line with the policy described above.
Derivatives are classified separately in the balance sheet as an asset or liability as appropriate.
In respect of interest-earning financial assets and interest bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their weighted average effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they reprice or mature.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year.
The other financial assets and liabilities of the group that are not included in the table below are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk.
The effective interest rate and repricing or maturity analysis is as follows: Fixed interest Weighted Total at average At floating fixed effective interest interest 1 year or More than As at interest rate Total rates rates less 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years December 31, 2006 Notes % m m m m m m m m m Financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts 20 4.79 141.9 141.9 Bank loans 20 5.77 364.3 265.2 99.1 38.7 20.1 40.3 Commercial paper 20 4.39 492.0 364.3 127.7 51.1 76.6 Debenture loans 20 6.52 1,161.0 509.5 651.5 12.8 191.6 447.1 Finance leases 20 3.4 3.4 1.0 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.2 Other loans 20 1.4 1.4 0.5 0.5 0.2 0.2 2,164.0 1,280.9 883.1 14.3 90.9 77.4 212.4 0.5 487.6 Less: Effect of interest rate swaps 480.9 480.9 9.9 108.4 76.6 185.2 254.0 Total financial liabilities excluding effect of interest rate swaps 2,164.0 800.0 1,364.0 24.2 199.3 0.8 397.6 0.5 741.6 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 18 4.83 766.7 766.7 Net debt 20 1,397.3 33.3 1,364.0 24.2 199.3 0.8 397.6 0.5 741.6 Floating Fixed comparison based on net debt 37% 63% Weighted average fixed rate 6.3% Weighted average fixed period 5.8 years Including effect of interest rate swaps Fixed interest Weighted average effective At floating Total at fixed 1 year or More than As at interest rate Total interest rates interest rates less 1-2 years 2-3 years 3-4 years 4-5 years 5 years December 31, 2005 Notes % m m m m m m m m m Financial liabilities: Bank overdrafts 20 4.86 20.9 20.9 Bank loans 20 5.30 371.2 264.1 107.1 0.3 42.7 21.4 42.7 Commercial paper 20 3.26 787.4 641.8 145.6 58.2 87.4 Debenture loans 20 6.09 890.1 593.6 296.5 5.3 145.6 145.6 Finance leases 20 0.8 0.8 0.6 0.2 Other loans 20 2.2 2.2 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.2 0.2 0.3 2,072.6 1,520.4 552.2 6.5 1.0 101.3 87.6 167.2 188.6 Less: Effect of interest rate swaps 540.8 540.8 10.5 199.8 101.0 87.4 293.3 225.6 Total financial liabilities excluding effect of interest rate swaps 2,072.6 979.6 1,093.0 17.0 200.8 0.3 0.2 460.5 414.2 Financial assets: Cash and cash equivalents 18 4.21 1,083.0 1,083.0 Net debt 20 989.6 103.4 1,093.0 17.0 200.8 0.3 0.2 460.5 414.2 Floating Fixed comparison based on net debt 44% 56% Weighted average fixed rate 6.3% Weighted average fixed period 5.1 years Including effect of interest rate swaps Notes to the accounts 110 Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 29 Financial risk management continued During 2006, $125m of the interest rate swaps relating to the 2010 $750m 7.875% fixed rate bond were cancelled, leaving $375m swapped to floating rates and $125m of the interest rate swaps relating to the 2013 $750m 5.25% fixed rate bond were cancelled, leaving $375m swapped to floating rates.
In addition, $250m of the 2016 $750m 6.125% fixed rate bond was swapped to floating rates.
During 2005, $250m of the interest rate swaps relating to the 2013 $750m 5.25% fixed rate bond were cancelled, leaving $500m swapped to floating rates at December 31, 2005. ii Foreign exchange risk Due to the nature of the groups products, which are generally uneconomic to transport long distances, there are few foreign exchange transaction exposures in the course of the groups day-to-day business.
The group does, however, have the majority 63.5% of its net assets in overseas locations denominated in foreign currencies, principally US dollars 42.1% of net assets.
As a consequence, changes in exchange rates affect both reported profit and asset values.
The exposure of asset values to changes in foreign exchange rates is controlled to an extent by matching a proportion of currency assets with currency liabilities using both debt and foreign exchange contracts.
This means that falling overseas exchange rates will result in both lower asset values and lower levels of net debt in sterling terms.
The interest cost of currency liabilities also provides a partial hedge for foreign currency income.
Energy price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments which together limit the effect of changing prices on the groups operating profit.
Derivative transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges where the hedge relationship meets the criteria for hedge accounting, and as non-designated hedges where the criteria are not met.
The notional and carrying values of energy hedges outstanding at December 31, 2006 are as follows: 2006 2005 m m Carrying Value 1.2 0.2 Notional Value 8.6 4.1 The maximum length of time over which energy price risk is hedged using derivatives is one year.
iv Hedging Hanson uses derivatives to mitigate or hedge market price risk.
Hedges are classified into the following types: Fair value hedges For effective fair value hedges, the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value on the balance sheet, with changes in fair value being taken through the income statement.
The carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged.
Hanson uses fixed to floating interest rate swaps to hedge the change in fair value of some of its fixed rate debt caused by interest rate movements: $375m of the $750m fixed rate bond maturing in 2010 $375m of the $750m fixed rate bond maturing in 2013 $250m of the $750m fixed rate bond maturing in 2016 199.8m of fixed rate bank debt Cash flow hedges For cash flow hedges, the fair value of the hedge is carried on the balance sheet.
The hedged item is either held off-balance sheet or recorded at historic or amortised cost, depending upon the type of transaction.
For effective hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument are taken to equity.
They are then recycled through the income statement in the period during which the hedged item impacts the income statement.
Included in the groups cash flow hedges are US$250m and A$250m of floating to fixed interest rate swaps hedging floating rate borrowings.
Other than floating rate borrowings the maximum length of time over which the variability in future cash flows of forecast transactions, is hedged is under one year.
Net investment hedges The group holds foreign currency denominated debt and forward exchange contracts as hedges of its foreign currency investments.
The value of such contracts is set out in the currency exposure table in section c ii of this note.
Non-designated hedges As IFRS has stringent rules under which hedge accounting may be applied, it is not considered practicable to apply hedge accounting for a small number of hedges including some hedges of energy.
These items are of generally low value.
Such hedges are deemed non-designated under IAS 39 and are recognised at fair value on the balance sheet with changes in their fair value being recognised immediately through the income statement.
The amount of hedge ineffectiveness during the year was not significant.
biz 111 29 Financial risk management continued d Fair value of financial instruments Fair value is the amount for which an asset could be exchanged, or a liability settled, between knowledgeable, willing parties on an arms length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
Hanson uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses swap models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value interest rate swaps.
For short-term assets and liabilities, the carrying amount is approximate to their fair value.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only the portions of the three $750m bonds which form part of an effective fair value hedge are shown at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of bonds at December 31, 2006 was 1,178.3m 940.4m, compared to their carrying value of 1,161.0m as at December 31, 2006.

Under IFRS, deferred tax assets are recognised for future deductions and utilisations of tax carry forwards to the extent that it is more likely than not that In 2006, the basis of calculation of income statement charges and balance suitable taxable profit is expected to be available.
Under US GAAP, deferred sheet positions for share based payments is consistent under IFRS and US tax assets are recognised at their full amounts and reduced by a valuation GAAP.
Under US GAAP, for awards granted prior to 2005, the group used a allowance to the extent it is more likely than not that suitable taxable profits Black Scholes model to calculate the fair value of awards.
For awards granted will not be available.

for the portion of awards dependent on market conditions and a Black Scholes model for the portion of awards dependent on non-market conditions.
Sharesave awards continue to be valued using a Black Scholes model.
The changes in method used to estimate the fair value were made in 2005 in order to be consistent with the estimates used for fair values determined under IFRS.
In periods prior to 2006, the group has applied the intrinsic value method under APB 25 Accounting for stock issued to employees as permitted by SFAS 123.
In line with the requirements of SFAS 123 and as amended by SFAS 148 Accounting for stock-based compensation transaction and Notes to the accounts 114 Notes to the accounts for the 12 months ended December 31, 2006 32 US accounting information continued Discontinued operations Discontinued operations are those clearly distinguishable operations and activities which either ceased or left the group in the accounting period or soon thereafter, including assets held for sale, where it is probable that the sale will complete within one year.
Prior to January 1, 2004, assets held for sale were not treated as discontinued operations.
IFRS includes equity method investments as part of discontinued operations whereas US GAAP specifically excludes equity method investee from scope.
Acquisition accounting US GAAP requires that a deferred tax asset or liability be raised to reflect the difference between the tax basis of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, and their fair values at the time of acquisition.
The same is true under IFRS.
However, where there are differences between the fair values of these assets and liabilities under IFRS and US GAAP, there will be a resulting difference in the deferred tax calculated.
The recognition of deferred tax assets or liabilities affects the amount of goodwill recognised on acquisition.
IFRS requires that contingent consideration is included within the cost of the consideration at the date of acquisition where it is probable that the resolution of the contingency will result in the transfer of economic benefit and that the amount can be measured reliably.
US GAAP, however, only permits recognition of such consideration once the contingency is resolved and the amount to be paid is determinable.
Under IFRS, when shares are issued as consideration for an acquisition, the fair value of that consideration is based upon the share price at the date the acquisition is unconditional.
Under US GAAP, the acquisition price is based upon the share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the date that the acquisitions are agreed to and announced.
Where an acquisition results in negative goodwill, IFRS requires that the excess amount is immediately taken to the income statement.
US GAAP requires the excess to initially be proportionally allocated to the fair values assigned to non-current assets.
Asset recognition Under IFRS, assets which include a degree of uncertainty become recognisable in accordance with the criteria set out in IAS 37 Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets.
Where such an asset is recognised under IFRS, it is discounted to its present value based on the timing of expected cash flows.
Although broadly similar, there are certain circumstances under US GAAP where a contingent asset can only be recognised if additional criteria are met.
New US accounting standards and pronouncements not yet adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No.
157 Fair Value Measurements SFAS 157, seeking to clarify the methodology used to measure fair value by emphasizing that market-based measurement should be used as the method to value assets and liabilities.
This establishes a fair value hierarchy and incorporates an adjustment for risk in the valuation model.
The statement will be applied prospectively from the effective date of January 1, 2008, with limited retrospective effect on financial instruments previously measured at fair value under the initial recognition of FASB Statement 133 Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.
While it is not possible to determine the financial impact of the prospective element of the statement, the effect of reversing the transition adjustment on adoption of SFAS 133 would be 10.0m credit to US GAAP net equity.
In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No.
48 Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No.
FIN 48 requires tax benefits from uncertain positions to be recognised only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits.
The interpretation also requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures, including discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in unrecognised tax benefits over the next 12 months, a description of open tax years by major jurisdiction, and a roll-forward of all unrecognised tax benefits.
FIN 48 applies for the groups financial year beginning 1 January 2007.
The group is currently in the process of quantifying the net adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2007, which will arise on adoption of FIN 48.
The Emerging Issues Task Force issued Abstract 06-2 Accounting for Sabbatical Leave and Other Similar Benefits Pursuant to FASB Statement No.
The abstract explains that compensated absence during which an employee is not required to carry out any duties in which the compensated absence is required to be earned, must be accrued over the preceding service period.
The methodology is applied under IAS 19 Employee benefits and has not resulted in a reconciling difference to US GAAP.
It is therefore not believed that the adoption of the abstract will have a material impact on transition.

f Cash flow statement The consolidated statements of cash flows prepared under IFRS present substantially the same information as those required under US GAAP.
These statements differ, however, with regard to classification of items within them.
Under US GAAP, cash and cash equivalents for cash flow purposes include short-term liquid resources but not overdrafts.
Under IFRS, overdrafts are included within the definition of cash equivalents.
Under US GAAP, capitalised interest is treated as part of the cost of the asset to which it relates and thus included as part of investing cash flows: under IFRS all interest is treated as operating activities.
Following the adoption of SFAS 123 R in 2006, the cash flow statement reflects excess tax benefits arising on the vesting of share-based payments as financing cash flows.
Under IFRS, the excess tax benefits are recorded as operating cash flows.

It is the groups policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities.
The tax provisions are analysed at each balance sheet date and adjustments are made as events occur to warrant adjustment to the provisions.
The provisions for taxes at December 31, 2006 were 93.5m 103.0m, 108.5m.
The decrease is due to revisions to the best reasonable estimate of the tax exposures, cash paid on certain audits and foreign exchange movement on non UK provisions.
The group has not provided deferred tax liabilities related to differences of its overseas subsidiaries and joint-ventures under Accounting Principles Board Opinion APB 23, Accounting for Income Taxes Special Areas as it is the groups policy to permanently reinvest such earnings.

i Additional information required by US GAAP in respect of accounting for the impairment of fixed assets and for fixed assets to be disposed of A summary of the impairment charges that have been recognised under US GAAP is as follows: 2006 2005 2004 m m m Assets to be disposed of Assets to be held and used 4.3 8.1 372.2 4.3 8.1 372.2 Disclosed as: Impairment charges recognised under IFRS: Operating impairment charges 4.3 23.6 29.8 Discontinued operations impairments 21.9 Operating impairment reversals 0.2 19.6 0.5 Charge for the year under IFRS 4.1 4.0 51.2 Less: Adjustment to goodwill impairment recognised under US GAAP 15.5 321.0 Plus: Adjustment to property, plant and equipment impairment under US GAAP 0.2 19.6 Total charge under US GAAP 4.3 8.1 372.2 Charged against: Intangible assets goodwill 2.1 324.8 Property, plant and equipment 4.2 5.9 25.4 Investment in joint-ventures 20.5 Other assets 0.1 0.1 1.5 4.3 8.1 372.2 Hanson 2006 www.
biz 121 32 US accounting information continued In 2006, 0.2m of impairment charges against property, plant and equipment at individual sites within UK Aggregates have been reversed.
Under US GAAP the reversal of such impairments is not permitted.
In 2005, previously recognised impairment charges against property, plant and equipment in North America of 19.6m have been reversed.
The reversal of such impairments is not permitted under US GAAP.
In addition, an impairment of goodwill of 17.6m has been recognised under IFRS.
Under US GAAP, 15.5m of this impairment has been recognised previously and therefore the IFRS impairment has been reversed.
Of the amounts charged as impairments in 2004 under IFRS, nil had been charged in prior years as amortisation under US GAAP or previously impaired under IFRS, and is therefore shown as a reduction in the difference between the charge under IFRS and US GAAP.
The operating impairment charge of 29.3m in 2004 under IFRS relates to various operations within North America, the UK and Asia Pacific, where it has been necessary to make an impairment provision for the difference in these operations carrying values compared with the higher of their value in use or net realisable value.
j Additional information required by US GAAP in respect of accounting for intangible assets subject to amortisation Other intangible assets subject to amortisation primarily consisting of purchase options, order backlogs and non-compete agreements capitalised since 2003, that have a cost of 33.5m 35.0m, 12.9m and an accumulated amortisation charge of 5.6m 5.5m, 3.4m.
The estimated aggregate amortisation expense for each of the next five years is 3.1m, 2.7m, 2.7m, 2.5m and 2.0m.

A description of the plans is included in note 5 in the Notes to the accounts and where applicable in the Remuneration Report.
The fair value of options granted and the fair value of options vested in the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004 are as follows: Long Term Sharesave Share Option Incentive Plan Scheme Plan Fair value of options granted during the years ended: pence pence pence December 31, 2006 501.5 181.5 December 31, 2005 307.7 133.7 76.2 December 31, 2004 116.1 81.5 Long Term Sharesave Share Option Incentive Plan Scheme Plan Total fair value of options vested during the years ended: m m m December 31, 2006 10.8 0.3 0.6 December 31, 2005 3.1 1.4 0.6 December 31, 2004 4.5 0.7 In 2004 and 2003, the group applied historical volatility as its basis to estimate expected volatility for the proforma disclosure required by SFAS 123.
In light of guidance provided by IFRS and in conjunction with external advisors, the group has re-evaluated its process for estimating volatility in 2005 resulting in volatility assumptions which are more reflective of market conditions.
This process has been applied prospectively for SFAS 123 reporting purposes in 2005.
The changes did not have a material impact on the groups proforma net income or related per share amounts.
In 2006, the group adopted SFAS 123 Revised Share-based payments SFAS 123R using the modified prospective method.
The impact of changing from the intrinsic value method under APB 25 Accounting for stock issued to employees to the fair value method under SFAS 123 R in 2006 is to increase income before taxes and net income by 14.7m and 9.7m respectively.
The impact on both basic and diluted earnings per share in 2006 is 1.4p per share.
