The enactment of the UIGEA resulted in a prohibitive legislative occurrence, as defined under the terms of the Groups revolving credit facility, which prevented further drawdown until discussions with lenders had determined whether there was a basis for the credit facility to be continued.
Due to the fact that customer redemptions are paid out more quickly than the receipt of customer deposits, it was anticipated that the enactment of the UIGEA might result in a temporary constraint on cashflow.
Therefore, the Company put in place arrangements for a short-term loan facility to be provided by founders of the Company, should the need arise.
A $50 million facility agreement was executed and placed in escrow, undated, such that if required, the Company could choose immediately to date the document and to drawdown the facility which would be for a term of six months from the drawdown date.
In the event that the loan agreement was taken out of escrow, an arrangement fee of 0.25% of the facility amount would be payable and interest thereon would accrue at the rate of 6% per annum.
Whilst there was a substantial cash outflow post-UIGEA as customers in the US and elsewhere sought to withdraw their client balances as evidenced by a $96.2 million reduction in client liabilities in the fourth quarter of 2006, there was no need for additional cash resources and the facility agreement remained in escrow as at 31 December 2006.
