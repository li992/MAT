Notes to the IFRS Financial Information For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 1 Basis of Preparation Following admission to the Official List, the Group is required to prepare statutory consolidated financial statements which comply with IFRS as adopted for use in the EU for the period ended 1 October 2006 the 2006 financial statements and subsequently.
The Groups principal activities are the development and operation of care homes for the elderly and the provision of specialist services for people with physical and or learning disabilities.
This financial information has been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and IFRIC interpretations endorsed by the EU and with those parts of the Companies Act, 1985, applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial information has been prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of certain financial instruments, which are recognised at fair value.
This is the Groups first consolidated financial information prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Accordingly, IFRS 1, First Time Adoption of IFRS revised 2004 has been applied.
IFRS 1 permits companies adopting IFRS for the first time to take exemptions from applying the full requirements of IFRS to certain items.
In preparing this financial information, the Group has applied the following: l As permitted, the implementation of IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, has been applied from 10 January 2005.
At the period end, the following standards and interpretations relevant to the Group, but which have not yet been adopted, were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments Disclosure IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements amended IAS 19 Employee benefits IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement amended IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement contains a Lease IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives yet to be adopted by the EU The Group does not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements on adoption.
The preparation of financial information in conformity with IFRS requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
The financial information presented is for the 28 weeks ended 2 October 2005 the financial period ended 2 October 2005 and the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 the financial year ended 1 October 2006.
The Group prepares its financial information for the financial year ending on the nearest Sunday to 30 September of a given calendar year.

Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 39 Notes to the IFRS Financial Information For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 1 Basis of Preparation continued Development of the Group continued Further details of the above acquisitions and other acquisitions are given in note 29.
The consolidated financial information of the Group represents the following: 28 weeks ended 2 October 2005 The consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group Limited, incorporating the effects of the Group reconstruction on 23 March 2005, and including: l the consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group Limited and its subsidiaries for the period from 10 January 2005 to 2 October 2005: and l the consolidated financial information of Highfield from 9 April 2005 to 2 October 2005.
52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 The consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC, including: l the consolidated financial information of Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC and its subsidiaries for the period from 3 October 2005 to 1 October 2006: and l the consolidated financial information of Ashbourne from 31 October 2005 to 1 October 2006.
The principal companies within the Group are disclosed in note 36.
2 Accounting Policies The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below.
These policies have been consistently applied to all the financial periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries made up to 2 October 2005 and 1 October 2006.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are considered when assessing whether the Group controls another entity.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Intangible assets in acquired companies which concern resident contracts are recognised and amortised over periods of up to three years.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is capitalised as goodwill.
Goodwill is not amortised: instead impairment tests are made annually, and any impairment is charged to the income statement.
Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired ie discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Revenue Recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of fee income relating to the provision of care services, net of price reductions directly related to sales.
Fee income comprises care home fees which are recognised when delivery of service is completed.
Fees invoiced in advance are included as deferred income until service is completed.
40 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued Home Payroll Costs Home payroll costs represent payroll costs directly incurred at home level, including costs incurred in respect of the use of agency labour.
Home Running Costs Home running costs represent costs of items directly incurred at home level, including food and kitchen supplies, medical supplies, utilities, maintenance and other running costs of the home.
Home EBITDAR before Central Costs Home EBITDAR before central costs represents profitability at a home level after taking account of home payroll and home running costs, but before rental charges on operating leases, central costs and depreciation on home assets.
Home EBITDA before Central Costs Home EBITDA before central costs represents profitability at a home level after taking account of home payroll and home running costs and rental charges in operating leases, but before central costs and depreciation on home assets.
Central Costs Central costs represent costs of head office support functions, including central payroll costs, other costs not directly attributable to a home level and certain other payroll costs.
EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA EBITDA represents earnings before depreciation, amortisation and profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment.
Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA after adding back exceptional central costs and the charge for future minimum rental increases.
The Group believes that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA and measures derived therefrom including Home EBITDAR before central costs and Home EBITDA before central costs facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by eliminating potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting finance income and costs, tax positions, the age and book depreciation of property, plant and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense and intangible assets identified affecting amortisation expense.
Exceptional Items Exceptional items are events or transactions that fall within the activities of the Group and which, by virtue of their size or incidence, have been disclosed in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial information.
Use of Boxes in Income Statement Boxes have been used in the income statement to provide sub-analyses of items in order to improve a readers understanding of the financial information.
Segmental Reporting A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of other business segments.
A geographical segment is engaged in providing products or services within a particular economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of segments operating in other economic environments.
Based on an analysis of risks and returns, the directors consider that the Group has two identifiable business segments: Elderly Care and Specialist.
All operations of the Group are carried out in the United Kingdom and therefore no geographical segmentation is disclosed.
Consequently, the Group has considered business segmentation as the primary segmentation, with two reportable segments, Elderly Care and Specialist.
Other Income Other income relates to management income received in respect of a portfolio of homes operated by the Group on behalf of a third party, as well as other operating income.
Income is recognised on completion of the management service on an accruals basis.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 41 Notes to the IFRS Financial Information For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued Share-based Payments Equity-settled Transactions The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award.
Fair value is determined by an external valuer using an appropriate pricing model.
In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company market conditions.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period has expired and managements best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described above.
The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging The Group uses derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently measured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective position is recognised in the income statement.
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability.
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to the initial carrying amount of a non financial asset or liability as above.
If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount is taken to the income statement.
Leases Assets held under finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are capitalised at inception of the lease, with a corresponding liability being recognised for the value of the leased asset or, if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful economic life or the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating leases and rentals payable are charged in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term where property lease contracts contain guaranteed minimum incremental rental payments, the total committed cost is determined and is calculated and amortised on a straightline basis over the lease term.
The charge for rentals currently payable is the actual amount payable, in the period, by the Group for its operating leases.
The charge for future minimum rental increases reflects the impact of recognising future-fixed committed rental increases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
42 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued Onerous Leases Provision is made for future operating lease payments of vacant care homes for the full remaining lease term or up to the expected point at which the lease is expected to be sublet.
Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Such losses include costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended.
Borrowing costs attributable to assets under construction are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date, of each asset evenly over its estimated useful life as follows: l Freehold buildings 2% per annum l Short leasehold property over life of lease l Motor vehicles 25% per annum l Fixtures and fittings 14% per annum 1 l Computer equipment 33 3% per annum The carrying value of property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Gains and losses on the sale of property, plant and equipment are recognised under central costs, unless they are so material as to be disclosed separately.
Intangibles Goodwill Business combinations completed on or after 10 January 2005 are accounted for under IFRS 3 using the purchase method.
Any excess of cost of the business combination over the Groups interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is recognised in the balance sheet as goodwill and is not amortised.
To the extent that the net fair value of the acquired entitys identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities is greater than the costs of investment, a gain is recognised immediately in the income statement.
After initial recognition, goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash generating units monitored by management, at the segment level.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Other Intangibles Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses.
An intangible asset acquired as part of a business combination is recognised outside of goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its fair value can be measured reliably.
Intangible assets with a finite life are amortised on a straightline basis over their estimated useful lives, as follows: l Resident contracts three years The carrying value of intangibles is reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 43 Notes to the IFRS Financial Information For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued Employee Benefit Costs Staff costs comprise salaries, wages and pensions for the Groups staff as well as other staff costs.
The Group operates defined contribution pension plans, which are plans under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods.
Contributions are recognised as employee benefit expenses as they fall due.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Where necessary, impairment is made for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.
Taxation including Deferred Tax The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in reserves.
Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents includes cash and balances in accounts at no or short notice.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities: however they are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the cash flow statement.
Finance Costs Financial costs include interest and amortisation of loan arrangement fees.
Loan arrangement fees are amortised evenly over the term of the associated loan instrument.
Finance Income Finance income is accrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
44 Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 2 Accounting Policies continued Receivables Trade receivables defined in accordance with IAS 39 are recorded initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method for any doubtful amounts.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate.
The movement in the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Any other trade receivables are recognised at their original amount less an allowance for any doubtful amounts.
An allowance is made when collection of the full amount is no longer considered probable.
Other Liabilities Other liabilities primarily comprise holiday pay liabilities, income taxes, other taxes and interest payable, which are measured at the best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation.
Other liabilities also comprise the fair value of derivative financial instruments.
Financial Risk Management The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in interest rates and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks, and others and they are summarised below.
Interest Rate Risk The Groups interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings which are issued at variable rates that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The interest exposure of the Group is managed within the constraints of the Groups business plan and the financial covenants under its facilities.
The Group aims to reduce exposure to the effect of interest rate movements by hedging an appropriate amount of interest rate exposure.
The impact of movements in interest rates is managed, where considered appropriate, through the use of fixed and floating rate debt and interest rate swaps.
Fair Value Estimates The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and overdrafts with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to approximate to their book values.
The fair value of long-term borrowings approximate to the carrying value reported in the balance sheet, as the majority are fixed rate borrowings and interest rate fluctuations have been minimal during the period.
Liquidity Risk As regards liquidity, the policy of the Group has throughout the year been to maintain a mix of short and long-term borrowings with short term flexibility achieved through overdraft facilities.
Credit Risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential residents before services commence.
3 Segmental Analysis Revenue, earnings before taxation and total equity of the Group are wholly attributable to the operation of care homes and arise solely within the United Kingdom.
The Group is unable to analyse income statement items below Home EBITDA before central costs.
The Groups financial reporting systems allow for the Balance Sheet to be prepared by legal entity only.
Individual legal entities often have both segments included, the financial reporting systems do not allow further analysis.
As such, the Group is unable to analyse assets or liabilities between the two operating segments.

For the purposes of this impairment review, goodwill is allocated to the Groups two business segments.
The recoverable amounts of these cash generating units CGUs are determined based on value in use calculations.
These cash flow projections are based on financial budgets approved by management covering a ten-year period.
Cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using the growth rates stated below.
The growth rates do not exceed the long-term average growth rate for sector in which the Group operates.
Key assumptions used for value in use calculations of both segments: Growth rate 3% Discount rate 9% As at 2 October 2005 and 1 October 2006, no impairment charge to goodwill has been required.

23 Financial Instruments Numerical financial instruments disclosures are set out below.
Additional disclosures are set out in the accounting policies relating to risk management.
In accordance with IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, management has reviewed contracts for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set out in the standard.
No such embedded derivatives were found.
Financial Instruments The Groups financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade receivables and trade payables, that arise directly from its operations.
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to manage the finance for the Groups operations.
The Group also enters into derivative transactions principally interest rate swaps.
The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risks arising from the Groups operations and its sources of finance.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Groups financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised below.
These policies remained unchanged throughout the periods presented.
Interest Rate Risk The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and bank borrowings.
The Group borrows in sterling at both fixed and floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps to manage the Groups exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Liquidity Rate Risk As regards liquidity, the Groups policy throughout the periods presented has been to maintain a mix of short, medium and long-term borrowings with a number of banks and institutions.
Short-term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities.
It is, in addition, the Groups policy to maintain borrowing facilities with a syndicate of banks.
Currency Risks The Group is based in the United Kingdom, with its operations entirely within the United Kingdom.
It does not hold any investment in overseas operations and consequently the balance sheet is not exposed to movements in currency exchange rates.
The Group does not have sales or purchase transactions in currencies other than the units functional currency and consequently does not have transactional currency exposures.

IFRS requires the minimum guaranteed lease payments made under operating leases to be recognised, as an expense, on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if the payments are not made on such a basis.
Consequently, rental charges included in the income statement have increased by 30.7m and 4.0m in the periods to 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005, respectively.
Related deferred tax assets of 9.3m and 1.2m have been recognised in the Group balance sheets as at 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005.
Goodwill amortisation Under UK GAAP, the Group amortises goodwill over its estimated useful economic life of 20 years.
IFRS 3 requires that goodwill is not amortised but is subject to an annual impairment review instead.
As required by IFRS 1 an impairment test was carried out on the date of transition to IFRS and annually thereafter.
No impairment was recognised and no other adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were made.
Goodwill amortisation charged under UK GAAP, totalling 8.9m and 3.1m in the periods to 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005, respectively, have been reversed.
Southern Cross Healthcare Group PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 79 Notes to the IFRS Financial Information For the 52 weeks ended 1 October 2006 37 Reconciliation of Net Assets and Profit under UK GAAP to IFRS continued Business Combinations IFRS requires that the cost of investment is allocated to the acquired entitys assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed based on fair values to the acquirer at the date of acquisition.
IFRS prescribes the allocation of the excess consideration to more categories of intangible assets such as resident contracts with goodwill being a residual asset.
Intangible assets associated with residents contracts totalling 4.9m have been recognised upon the acquisition of Southern Cross Equityco Limited.
Amortisation on resident contracts totalling 1.6m and 0.9m has been recognised as an expense, for the periods to 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005, respectively.
Financial Instruments Under UK GAAP, gains and losses from derivative financial instruments used for hedging purposes are not recognised in earnings or as adjustments to carrying amounts until the underlying hedged transaction matures or occurs.
IAS 39 requires all derivatives to be recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
Consequently, interest rate swaps with a negative fair value of Nil and 3.9m have been recognised in the Group balance sheets at 1 October 2006 and 2 October 2005 respectively.
Related deferred tax assets of Nil and 1.2m have been recognised in the Group balance sheets.
