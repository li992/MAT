In the case of long-term borrowings due in more than one year, for disclosure purposes the fair values have been estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
Details of the maturity dates of the long-term borrowings are set out in Note 18.

RIS and certain connected entities.
The proceedings relate to the Companys investment in H-G Holdings Inc. and a loan made to RIS by the Companys wholly-owned subsidiary, Atlantic and General Investment Trust Limited AGIT.
The claim against all of the defendants was for approximately US$240 million.
On 15 March 2002 the New York Court dismissed the proceedings in their entirety at their initial stage for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.
On 1 April 2002 the plaintiffs filed an appeal against that dismissal.
On 23 September 2003 the New York Appellate Court affirmed the dismissal of the proceedings as to thirty causes of action included in the claim and as to AGIT.
The New York Appellate Court reinstated three of the causes of action as to seven of the defendants, including the Company, and referred the matter back to the New York Court for further proceedings with respect to those three causes of action.
Based upon legal advice received, the Directors do not believe that the proceedings will have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.
