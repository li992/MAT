Property, plant and equipment continued Freehold property includes land having a cost of 28.1m 2005: 31.6m which is not depreciated.
The depreciation charge for the year includes depreciation of assets held under finance leases of 0.4m 2005: 1.2m.
The impairment charge in the year ended 31 March 2005 of 18.5m arose from a comparison of the carrying value of a number of properties held by the Groups Japanese subsidiary with the higher of net realisable value and value in use.
The net realisable value was determined by independent valuers and was based on recent transactions for similar properties within the same market.
2006 2005 Restated m m The carrying values shown above include the following: Finance lease assets 18.9 16.9 Assets in the course of construction 15.0 17.4 Properties held by Toshiba EMI Limited were carried at a revalued amount prior to the implementation of IAS16 Tangible Fixed Assets in the year ended 31 March 2005.
The revalued amount was based on third party expert valuation.
Under the transitional arrangements of that standard, the carrying value of these properties has been frozen and carried forward as deemed cost.
These properties are currently held at net book value of 30.4m 2005: 37.2m.
The comparable amount under the historical cost convention would be 3.9m 2005: 14.3m.

The available-for-sale investments included above represent both listed and unlisted equity investments which offer the Group the opportunity of return through dividend income.
The fair values of the listed element of these investments are based on quoted market prices.
Fair value gains and losses on these investments are charged directly to equity.
The unlisted element of these investments is valued at cost.
The investments at fair value through profit and loss included above represent listed equity investments which offer the Group the opportunity of returns through dividend income and fair value gain.
The fair values of these investments are based on quoted market prices.
Fair value gains and losses on these investments are charged to profit and loss.
Financial derivatives 2006 2005 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities m m m m Interest rate swaps fair value hedge excluding accrued interest 11.0 13.6 16.9 9.6 Convertible bond derivative 86.7 83.2 425m 8.625% senior notes embedded call feature 30.3 22.1 41.3 100.3 39.0 92.8 Interest rate swaps The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 March 2006 were 586.2m 2005: 557.7m.
At 31 March 2006, the fixed interest rates vary from 8.38% to 8.63% 2005: 8.38% to 8.63% and the main floating rates are three-month LIBOR 465 basis points and three-month EURIBOR 440 basis points 2005: three-month LIBOR 465 basis points and three-month EURIBOR 440 basis points.
The fair value of the interest rate swaps is equal to the book value.
Convertible bond derivative On issue of the guaranteed convertible bond, the fair value of the liability component was determined using a market rate for an equivalent nonconvertible bond.
As the convertible bond is denominated in US Dollars but convertible into Sterling shares, the remainder of the proceeds were allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included as a derivative liability, net of issue costs.
The value of the call feature is revalued to fair value at each balance sheet date, with movements in the fair value reflected as finance costs or finance income.
425m 8.625% senior notes On or after 15 October 2008, the Company may redeem all or part of the notes at redemption prices plus accrued interest fixed for the 12-month period starting at the date shown 15 October 2008, 104.3125%: 15 October 2009,102.8750%: 15 October 2010, 101.4375%: and from 15 October 2011 at 100.0000%.
At 31 March 2006, this embedded call feature had a fair value of 30.3m 2005: 22.1m and is included as a derivative asset.
73 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 15.
Financial derivatives continued Net investments in foreign operations In addition to the 425m 8.625% senior notes the Group had Euro and Yen denominated drawings under its 450m revolving credit facility.
These drawings were fully repaid at 31 March 2006.
During the year, the Euro borrowing had foreign exchange losses of 4.1m 2005: 9.5m loss while the Yen borrowing had foreign exchange gains of 0.3m 2005: nil.
The foreign exchange loss on the Euro borrowing has been treated as a finance exceptional item and charged to the income statement.
As the Yen borrowing is a partial hedge of the net investment in the Groups Japanese subsidiary, the foreign exchange gain on translation of the borrowing to Sterling at the balance sheet date was recognised in other reserves in shareholders equity to the extent that the borrowing provided a hedge against the net investment, the remainder of 0.3m 2005: nil being credited to the income statement.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances, cash and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade and other receivables.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful debts.
Such an allowance is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the debt.
The credit risk on bank balances is limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of geographically dispersed counterparties.

Short-term deposits are ordinarily made for periods varying between one day and one month, although can extend to periods of up to three months, depending on the immediate cash requirements of the Group, and earn interest at the respective short-term deposit rates.
The Group has balances of cash and cash equivalents totalling 60.7m 2005: 113.1m held with banks within the UK and 130.2m 2005: 127.8m held with banks outside, but freely transferable to, the UK.

The fair value of publicly traded borrowings has been calculated using the appropriate market prices at the balance sheet date.
For the borrowings which are not publicly traded, the fair value has been calculated by discounting their future cash flows at the appropriate market rate.
This facility replaced a revolving credit facility 250m, a 364 day facility, 100m and enabled a subsidiary to repay the US$123.8m 6.96% senior notes.
In addition, two bilateral facilities 40m were not renewed.
This resulted in exceptional refinancing costs of 5.2m 2005: nil of which 3.5m was in respect of issue and repayment costs of the US$123.8m 6.96% senior notes and 1.7m in respect of issue costs relating to the 250m revolving credit facility.
On 11 March 2003, Moodys Investor Service downgraded the Groups credit rating from Baa2 to Ba1.
As a consequence, the coupon of the 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds was increased from 8.25% to 9.75% with effect from 20 May 2003 and the coupon of the US$123.8m 6.96% senior notes was increased from 6.96% to 8.46% with effect from 21 August 2003.
The Group holds equivalent US Dollar nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon and the term of the US$500m 8.375% guaranteed notes effectively converting the interest basis of the issue to floating rate set in arrears.
See Note 15 for the derivative portion of the borrowing.
The Group holds equivalent Euro nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon and the term of the 425m 8.625% senior notes effectively converting the interest basis of the issue to floating rate set in arrears.
At 31 March 2006, the Group had available 437.1m 2005: 349.1m of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met.
The term loan of 3.2m 2005: 2.9m was raised in the period July 2004 to December 2005.
Repayments will commence in August 2006 and will continue until January 2008.
The loan carries a floating rate of interest at LIBOR 1.5%.
Overdrafts are unsecured, repayable on demand, and are charged interest at variable rates.
For details regarding the Groups obligations under finance leases, see Note 21.
Convertible bond The US$243.3m 5.25% guaranteed convertible bond, which was issued in October 2003, is repayable in October 2010.
The bonds are convertible into US$1,000 Preference Shares of the issuer which will be exchangeable immediately upon issue for Ordinary Shares in the Company.
The number of Ordinary Shares for which a Preference Share may be exchanged will be determined by dividing the paid-up value of the Preference Share, translated into Sterling at the fixed rate of US$1.5957, by the exchange price initially set at 193.38p per Ordinary Share.
Conversion by the holder at 193.38p per Ordinary Share may occur after 11 November 2003 until seven days prior to the final redemption date.
Conversion by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, of all but not part, may occur if the average price per Ordinary Share on at least 20 dealing days in any period of 30 consecutive dealing days has been 130p: or at any time if 85% or more of the aggregate principal amount has been previously purchased, redeemed or cancelled.
Redemption by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, may occur if the same aggregate principal amount has been previously purchased, redeemed or cancelled.
Redemption by the issuer, after 16 October 2007, may occur if the same conditions which apply to conversion by the issuer are met.
Final redemption is on 2 October 2010 at 100% of principal and accrued interest.

The lease runs for a term of 15 years, although the Group has the option to repurchase the property at any time between years five and 12.
If the Group opts not to take up this option, then ownership of the property will revert to the lessor at the end of the lease.
The rentals payable under the lease, along with the premium payable should the Group take up the option to repurchase, are set out in the lease agreement.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of nil 2005: nil of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 441.5m 2005: 430.2m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in the unrecognised tax losses are losses of 51.7m 2005: 51.6m that will expire in 2022.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
At the balance sheet date, the Group had net other deductible temporary differences of 28.3m 2005: 71.7m.
No deferred tax has been recognised due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Temporary differences arising in connection with interests in associates and jointly controlled operations are insignificant.

Trading Trading provisions include royalty audit and other trading provisions charged through profit from operations before operating exceptional items and amortisation.
They also include restructuring and reorganisation provisions charged through operating exceptional items see Note 8.
Disposal and fundamental reorganisation This provision relates to the reorganisation costs for the closure and or sale of EMIs manufacturing businesses in North America and Europe.
Acquisition and integration The provision relates to acquisition and integration costs that were created for eamouts.
Employee benefits This provision relates to long term and termination benefits.
Pensions The Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The nature of the Scheme in a particular country is usually in line with local custom and practice and is supportive of, and a key element of, the Groups overall human resources strategy.
This operational philosophy results in the majority of the Groups schemes being of the defined contribution type.
This has always been the case in, for example, the US.
In a limited number of countries of operation, the Groups local pension arrangements are entirely or partly of the defined benefit type.
With the exception of the schemes in the UK, Germany and Japan, these defined benefit arrangements are not significant in size as confirmed by the following summary of the Groups total pension provisions.
The schemes in these three countries are material in size and so full detail on each of them is given in the following narrative.

Benefits provided by the UK Fund are based on final pensionable pay and include a pension which is guaranteed to increase each year by the lower of 5% and the increase in the cost of living.
The UK Fund was closed to new entrants on 1 November 2005, on which date a defined contribution plan was started for the benefit of eligible new joiners to the Groups UK businesses.
The combination of the launching of a flexible benefits programme to most of the Groups UK employees and the announced closure of the UK Fund to new entrants contributed significantly to an approximate 35% increase in Fund membership amongst eligible employees.
This is the main reason for the increase in service cost from 9.0m in 2005 to 12.2m in 2006.
The Group operates two plans in Japan, the financial detail of which is reported in aggregate later in this Note.
There were two significant changes to one of these plans, the employees plan, during 2006.
The employees plan, whilst remaining a defined benefit scheme, was modified from a final salary scheme to a cash balance scheme on 1 April 2005.
The impact of this Plan amendment is reported below.
Later in the year, as part of the sale of the manufacturing division of the Group subsidiary to a third party, a significant number of employees transferred their employment to the purchaser.
An appropriate quantum of assets was transferred from the Groups pension plan to that of the new employer, in line with the transfer of defined benefit obligation.
These transfers are described as divestiture in the following narrative.
There were no significant changes in the German scheme during the year.
The amounts recognised in the Group consolidated income statement and in the Group consolidated statement of recognised income and expense for the year are analysed as follows: Year ended 31 March 2006 United Kingdom Germany Japan Total m m m m Recognised in the Group consolidated income statement Current service cost 12.2 0.3 1.7 14.2 Plan amendment 5.0 5.0 Divestiture 0.3 0.3 Recognised in arriving at profit from operations 12.2 0.3 3.0 9.5 Expected return on scheme assets 54.2 0.9 55.1 Interest cost on scheme liabilities 46.4 1.4 0.7 48.5 Recognised in arriving at total net finance charges 7.8 1.4 0.2 6.6 79 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 26.

Scheme assets are stated at their market values at the respective balance sheet dates and overall expected rates of return are established by considering best estimates for the expected long-term rates of return from the main asset classes.
The date of the last actuarial valuation of scheme assets and obligations was 31 March 2006.

The current disclosures above relate to assumptions based on longevity following retirement at the balance sheet date, with future being that relating to an employee retiring in 2035.
As the plans in Japan provide a cash sum at retirement, no post-retirement life expectancy assumption is required.
Members contribute to the UK Fund at the rate of 4% 2005: 4% except in the case of those members whose contributions are paid by the employer following the launch of a flexible benefits programme in 2005.
There were no employee contributions to either the German fund or the Japanese fund in either 2005 or 2006.
Employer contributions are made to the UK fund at the rate of 21% 2005: 21% and to the Japanese fund as advised by the insurance company which administers the fund.
Contributions to the plans were 13.3m 2005: 11.9m and are expected to be 12.5m in 2007.

The EMI Group General Employee Benefit Trust EBT was established to hedge the future obligations of the Group in respect of shares awarded under the Senior Executive Incentive Plans.
The Trustee of the EBT, EMI Group EBT Guernsey Limited, purchases the Companys Ordinary Shares in the market with financing provided by the Company, as required, on the basis of regular reviews of the anticipated share liabilities of the Group.
The EBT has since December 1998 waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of all of its holding of the Companys Ordinary Shares.
The EBTs waiver may be revoked or varied at any time.
EBT 2006 2005 Shares held Shares held in trust Cost in trust Cost No.
The market value at 31 March 2006 of the Ordinary Shares held in the EBT, which are listed in the UK, was 8.6m 2005: 9.1m.
All shares held in the EBT are either under option to employees or conditionally gifted to them.

Share-based payment Equity-settled share option schemes Subscription options Options granted under the 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS are normally exercisable no earlier than three years and no later than ten years following the date of grant and are subject to the achievement of performance requirements that must be met before the options normally become exercisable.
Options granted under the 2003 Executive Share Incentive Plan ESIP, if subject to a pre-vesting performance requirement, are normally exercisable between three and ten years following the date of grant but only if, and to the extent that, the pre-vesting target has been satisfied.
Options granted with pre-grant conditions normally become exercisable in no fewer than four annual tranches commencing no earlier than the second anniversary of the grant date.
There are no cash settlement alternatives for the schemes.
Transfer options Transfer options have been granted to senior executives under the ESOS and the ESIP with the exercise price of the options being the average of the market price of the Companys Ordinary Shares in a period of three or five days prior to the date of grant.
The proportion of each option that vests will be determined by the Groups average compound underlying diluted earnings per share growth over RPI from the base year to the end year of the performance period.
The option will lapse if this target increase is not achieved within the three years from the date of grant.
There are no cash settlement alternatives to receiving shares on the exercise of the option.
A detailed description of the performance conditions attached to the options is provided in the Remuneration report.
Employee Plan Options granted under the 1994 and 2004 Savings-Related Share Option Schemes SRSOS are normally exercisable for a six month period following completion of savings to either a three year or a five year savings contract.
There are no performance criteria attached to these awards.

The exemptions from IFRS 1 were in respect of employees who left before 1 January 2005.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the following schemes are: ESOS subscription options 2.49 2005: 2.28 SRSOS subscription options 2.43 2005: 2.22 ESOS transfer options nil 2005: nil For the share options outstanding as at 31 March 2006, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6.4 years 2005: 7.5 years.
Share-based payment continued The actual expense recognised for equity settled share-based payment in respect of employee services received during the year to 31 March 2006 is 4.9m 2005: 2.3m.
The weighted average fair value of share options granted during the year was 85.6p 2005: 88.7p.
The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 7.35 0.96 2005: 7.47 0.96.
The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year, the exercise of which is subject to a performance condition, was 120.5p 2005: 95.9p while the weighted average fair value of options granted under the SRSOS during the year was 89.5p 2005: 87.2p.
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a proprietary binomial model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
The services received and the liability to pay for those services are recognised over the expected vesting period.
Until the liability is settled, it is remeasured at each reporting date with any changes in fair value being recognised in the income statement.
For awards with market conditions attached, the modelling of the impact of this TSR condition is performed using a Monte Carlo model based on the history of weekly returns of the constituents of the FTSE 250 index.
The following table lists the variables used in the model for the years ending 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005: 2006 Share Performance options shares SRSOS Weighted average share price at grant 254.3p 254.3p 249.0p Weighted average share exercise price 255.7p n a 198.0p Weighted average expected volatility 39% 39% 40% Weighted average expected life years 4.8 3.5 4.3 Risk free rate Range used is between 4.1% to 4.4% Weighted average expected dividend yield 3.2% 3.2% 3.2% 2005 Share Performance options shares SRSOS Weighted average share price at grant 238.6p 237.4p 225.0p Weighted average share exercise price 231.7p n a 178.0p Weighted average expected volatility 48% 48% 44% Weighted average expected life years 4.3 3.3 4.4 Risk free rate Range used is between 3.4% to 5.2% Weighted average expected dividend yield 3.4% 3.4% 3.6% Expected volatility is the measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during a period.
The measure of volatility used in option pricing models is the annualised standard deviation of the continuously compounded rates of return on the share.
For each grant the assumed volatility has been calculated over a period prior to grant commensurate with the expected life of the award.
Adjustments have been made for historic events that are unlikely to recur in the future.
Financial commitments The Group has commitments, which are largely performance-related, to pay advances to artists, repertoire owners and songwriters amounting to 496.7m at 31 March 2006 2005: 388.4m.
There are no capital commitments at the year end 2005: nil.
Pursuant to a joint venture agreement with Mr Norman Cheng Project Typhoon the Group has agreed to establish and fund new businesses in the Peoples Republic of China, Hong Kong and South Korea.
The Group has an option to buy and Mr Cheng has an option to sell his equity interest in the joint venture in 2009 at a price determined by reference to earnings over a three-year period.
Such a price can be limited to not more than $100m.
Annual commitments under operating leases at 31 March were as follows: 2006 2005 m m Land and buildings: In the first year 24.3 24.6 In the second to fifth years inclusive 74.7 63.8 After the fifth year 108.8 110.7 Total 207.8 199.1 Plant, equipment and vehicles: In the first year 3.3 3.0 In the second to fifth years inclusive 3.2 6.2 After the fifth year Total 6.5 9.2 85 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31.
Contingent liabilities Save as described below, there are no legal or arbitration proceedings involving members of the EMI Group which, so far as the Company is aware, may have a material effect on the financial position of the Group: i The Group, along with other companies in the music and broadcast industries, has received requests from the New York State Attorney General for information regarding practices in connection with the promotion of records on New York state radio stations.
The Group has co-operated fully with this enquiry.
EMI has a long-standing, strict, written policy prohibiting unlawful radio promotion practices, and that policy has been reaffirmed internally.
Certain of the other companies have reached resolution with the Attorney General requiring the adoption of certain radio promotion practices.
The Group has already adopted such practices and is currently engaged in discussions with a view towards a resolution with the Attorney General.
EMI is not currently aware of any reason for believing that there will be a material financial impact on the Group: ii The Group has also, along with other companies in the music industry, received requests from the New York State Attorney General and the United States Department of Justice for information regarding conditions and pricing of the online sale of music.
The Group is co-operating fully with these enquiries.
Arising out of these enquires, certain Group companies have been named, along with other companies in the music industry, in 14 separate lawsuits filed in various courts throughout the US.
The cases are styled as class action suits on behalf of consumers, and the plaintiffs assert various federal and state law claims relating to allegations of unfair pricing and anti-competitive practices in connection with the online sale of music.
Whilst the enquiries are at an early stage and the lawsuits have only recently been filed, on the basis of information presently available, EMI is not aware of any reason for believing that there will be a material financial impact on the Group: iii Certain Group companies are defendants in legal proceedings brought in the New York and the English courts in connection with claims by Apple Corp. the entity that represents the interests of The Beatles, regarding alleged underpayment of royalties in respect of sales of Beatles recordings.
The cases are being vigorously defended and the Group believes that the claims are largely without merit.
The Group had provided the following guarantees at 31 March 2006: i Following the demerger of the Thorn rental business in 1996, Group companies remained contingently liable in respect of guarantees given with regard to certain leases on properties occupied or previously occupied by the Thorn business though, as part of the demerger arrangements, Thorn Limited formerly called Thorn plc agreed to indemnify the Group against such liabilities.
One of the Group companies so liable was sold to HMV Group as part of the 1998 sale and the Company agreed to indemnify HMV Group plc against any such liabilities.
The current or former Thorn properties in respect of which the Group remained contingently liable number approximately 47 2005:50 and the annual rental payments in respect of such properties total approximately 3.6m 2005: 3.6m.
Following the insolvency of Thorn High Street Properties Limited and certain other companies, claims have arisen against the Group in respect of many of the guaranteed leases.
Such claims have been met by Thorn Limited pursuant to its agreement to indemnify the Group: ii As part of the sale in 1998 to HMV Group plc HMV Group of the companies and assets comprising HMV, the Group entered into an indemnity deed with HMV Group relating, among other things, to guarantees given by the Group in respect of property leases of which approximately 62 2005: 75 remain outstanding.
Under the deed, HMV Group agreed to indemnify the Group against any payments made under those property leases and certain other guarantees and indemnities.
The aggregate annual rental payments under guaranteed leases are approximately 18.6m 2005: 20.7m, although they are subject to adjustment both up and down under certain circumstances.
The guaranteed leases have terms which expire in 9 to 20 years 2005: 10 to 21 years and 19 of the leases expire in years beyond 2016.
The indemnity deed remains in force in respect of lease guarantees, and HMV Group has secured those obligations pursuant to a security deed, the Companys rights under which rank second behind banks which provide senior credit facilities to HMV Group: iii Letters of credit and third party guarantees totalling 7.0m 2005: 8.9m have been incurred by Group companies.

iii Defined benefit pension plans As per Note 26, the Group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world.
The main scheme, which covers employees in the UK, is the EMI Group Pension Fund the UK Fund.
The Group also operates significant defined benefit schemes in Germany and Japan.
With the exception of these schemes, the other defined benefit schemes operated on behalf of the Group are not material.
Further details are provided in Note 26.
Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including the year ended 31 March 2005, the Group prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK generally accepted accounting practice UK GAAP.
These financial statements, for the year ended 31 March 2006, are the first the Group is required to prepare in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union.
Accordingly, the Group has prepared financial statements which comply with IFRSs applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005 and the significant accounting policies meeting those requirements are described in the Accounting policies section of these financial statements.
In preparing these financial statements, the Group has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 April 2004, the Groups date of transition to IFRS, and made those changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards for the first time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the principal adjustments made by the Group in restating its UK GAAP balance sheet as at 1 April 2004 and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The Group has classified its adjustments to IFRS under the following headings: i Dividends: ii Acquisitions: iii Employee benefits: iv Property and leases: v Convertible bond: vi Other financial instruments: vii Tax: and viii Reclassifications.
Exemptions applied IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards allows first-time adopters certain exemptions from the general requirement to apply IFRS as effective for 31 March 2006 year ends retrospectively.
Details of the exemptions that the Group has taken under this allowance are included in the Accounting policies section of these financial statements under the heading IFRS 1First-time Adoption of IFRS.

The effect of this on the Group is that the final dividend relating to any particular financial year cannot be accounted for until the following financial year.
The impact of this change on the Balance Sheet and Equity is 62.8m as at1April 2004 and 63.1m as at 31March 2005. ii Acquisitions The Group has taken the exemption granted by IFRS 1 and applied IFRS 3 for acquisitions after 31 March 2003.
The key effect of the adoption of IFRS 3 upon the Groups accounting has been the Group ceasing annual goodwill amortisation and instead testing for impairment annually.
The impact of this change in accounting policy is to reverse goodwill amortisation and so increase profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 2.9m.
89 Notes to the Group financial statements continued 33.
Transition to IFRS continued iii Employee benefits, including share-based payments Under UK GAAP, pension costs, which were determined in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, were charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost of pensions over the working lives of the employees within the Group.
Valuation surpluses or deficits were amortised over the expected remaining working life within the Group of the relevant employees.
The main impact of IAS 19 Employee Benefits is to bring the surpluses or deficits of the Groups defined benefit pension schemes onto the balance sheet.
In addition, certain employee benefits earned but not yet paid or used need to be accrued on the balance sheet.
The impact of this change in accounting policy on the income statement for the year ended 31 March 2005 is an additional charge to profit from operations of 7.5 m and a net credit to finance charges of 9.5m.
In addition, this has resulted in the inclusion on the balance sheet of a liability of 93.2m at 1 April 2004 and 86.5m at 31 March 2005.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires an expense to be recognised where the Group buys services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The main impact of IFRS 2 on the Group is the expensing of employees and Directors share options and other share-based incentives at fair value over the vesting period of the award.
The Group has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 January 2005.
The impact of this change in accounting policy is to increase profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.1m.
iv Property and leases Under IAS 16, the impairment on previously revalued property charged directly to the revaluation reserve under UK GAAP must now be expensed through the income statement.
The impact of this is to decrease profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 18.5m.
Following the adoption of IAS 17 Leases, one lease entered into by the Group has been reclassified from an operating lease to a finance lease.
In addition, a lease incentive is being released over the full lease term instead of the shorter period over which it was being released under UK GAAP.
The impact of these changes in accounting policy is to decrease profit for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 0.8m, to include property on the balance sheet of 17.9m at 1 April 2004 and 16.9m at 31 March 2005, and to include a finance lease liability on the balance sheet of 17.9m at 1 April 2004 and 17.2m at 31 March 2005. v Convertible bond IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement have significantly changed the accounting for borrowings, finance charges and other financial instruments.
For the Groups convertible bond, amounts received from the issue have been split between debt and derivative components.
The difference between the debt portion of the convertible and the principal is amortised as a finance charge over the life of the convertible.
The impact of this change is to decrease profit for 2005 by 2.0m and reduce borrowings by 16.1m at 31 March 2005 1 April 2004: 18.6m.
In addition, a derivative must now be recognised on the balance sheet at fair value for the eventual conversion of the debt into a fixed number of EMI Group plc Ordinary Shares 31 March 2004: 116.3m, 31 March 2005: 83.2m.
Any movements in the fair value, excluding the impact of foreign exchange movements, are reported as finance charges 2005: 31.2m income.
vi Other financial instruments Under IAS 32 and IAS 39, the principal accounting changes relate to the following financial instruments: Interest rate swaps: the Group has adopted hedge accounting in respect of fixed to floating interest rate swaps held as hedges against fixed interest rate borrowings.
The interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value with a corresponding adjustment to borrowings.
A credit to finance charges of 1.7m for the year ended 31 March 2005 has been recorded due to a small amount of hedge ineffectiveness: Embedded derivative: on or after 15 October 2008, the Group may redeem all or part of the 425m 8.625% senior notes at redemption prices plus accrued interest fixed for the 12-month period starting at the date shown above.
A financial derivative asset must be recognised on the balance sheet at the fair value of this embedded call feature 1 April 2004: 22.3m, 31 March 2005: 22.1m.
Any movements in the fair value are reported as finance charges 2005: 0.2m charge : Swap unwind: in 2003, the Group unwound a swap position resulting in a gain of 55.6m, which was deferred and is being released over the scheduled remaining life of the borrowing.
Under IFRS, this deferred gain has been reclassified from creditors to borrowings, resulting in an opening balance adjustment of 32.4m: Foreign exchange on borrowings: the Groups High Yield Euro bond cannot be classified as a net investment hedge under IFRS and hence the exchange loss on this borrowing of 9.5m for the year ended 31 March 2005 can no longer be recorded directly in reserves but, instead, is booked as a finance charge: Listed investments: those which have been designated as fair value through profit and loss have been revalued to fair value, with the increase in value of 0.2m for the year ended 31 March 2005 being booked to profit from operations.
vii Tax Due to the introduction of IAS 12 Income Taxes and the changes in accounting policies from the introduction of IFRS, corresponding adjustments have occurred in the calculation of income taxes.
The impact on tax of these changes in accounting policies is to increase profit after taxation for the year ended 31 March 2005 by 7.3m, 7.6m of which relates to the tax credit on the impairment of property.
No tax has been provided in respect of the gain on the convertible bond derivative of 31.2m, as tax legislation is not yet finalised.
viii Reclassifications Under IFRS, the classification of Current Assets is defined as being the operating cycle of the company.
As such, the Group has reclassified certain assets between current and non-current on the balance sheet.
This includes a number of investments which have been classified, under the provisions of IAS 39, as either fair value though profit and loss, held-to-maturity or available-for-sale.
Those investments classified as held-to-maturity or availablefor-sale are deemed non-current, whereas those classified as fair value through profit and loss are deemed current.
A number of classifications have also been made between reserves in order to show the foreign exchange reserve separately and to absorb the UK GAAP revaluation reserve, which is no longer required under IFRS, into retained earnings.
The expenses that the Group incurs and the share of the income that the Group earns from the sale of goods by the jointly controlled operations are included in the income statement.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups share of profits from joint marketing arrangements was included within other operating income.
The impact of this reclassification is to increase revenue by 58.4m, increase cost of sales by 22.2 m, increase distribution costs by 0.7 m and reduce other operating income by 35.5 m. 90
