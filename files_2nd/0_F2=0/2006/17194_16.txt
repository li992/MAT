The acquisitions of David Wilson Homes Yorkshire Limited and Ward Homes Group Limited were made in the year ended 31st December 2003.
The acquisition of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited was completed on 26th April 2006 and resulted in the recognition of 4.5m of goodwill.
The principal reasons for the acquisitions were to gain control of each companys land bank, and accordingly individual sites have been treated as cash generating units for the purposes of allocating goodwill.
Impairment reviews were performed as at 30th June 2006 and 31st December 2006 2005: 1st July and 31st December comparing the value in use for each site with the carrying amount of land and work in progress together with the goodwill allocated to that site.
The value in use was determined by discounting the expected future cash flows of each site.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, expected changes in selling prices for completed housing units and expected changes in costs to complete the site.
Management estimate discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks appropriate to the cash generating units.
The discount rate that is considered by management to be appropriate is the Groups weighted average cost of debt of 5.9% which equates to the cost of holding land investments.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based upon past experience and expectations of future changes in the market.
Expected future cash flows have been taken over the remaining period that the sites are expected to trade none of which extend beyond 2009.
As a result of these reviews an impairment of 3.5m 2005: 7.3m was recorded in cost of sales.
No adjustment was required to the carrying value of the individual sites.
The impairment arises as a result of the consumption of land on the sites acquired as these have been built out, in whole or in part.

Acquisition On 26th April 2006, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited and its subsidiary, North West Land Developments Limited, for cash consideration of 49.2m.
This transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The principal activity of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited is housebuilding.

This has resulted in the following adjustments: An increase of 0.4m in trade and other receivables due to the identification of other assets that are recoverable by the acquired company: An increase of 0.8m in deferred tax liabilities due to the identification of further tax liabilities which are expected to become payable in future: and A reduction in the goodwill arising upon acquisition of 0.1m and purchase consideration by 0.5m reflecting the impact of the above adjustments.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited is attributable to the expected profitability of the individual sites acquired and the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination.
Roland Bardsley Homes Limited contributed 23.3m revenue and a profit of 1.4m to the Groups profit before tax for the period, after reorganisation costs of 1.2m note 3, between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, based upon the accounts of Roland Bardsley Homes Limited and excluding pre-acquisition items related to the sale of the business of 1.7m, Group revenues for the period would have been 1,336.2m and Group profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the parent would have been 153.5m.

Bank overdrafts, loans and derivative financial instruments continued iii Currency, interest rates and fair value continued Fixed rate sterling bank loans of 79.9m 2005: 79.9m were arranged at fixed interest rates and expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate sterling bank loans for 2006 was 7.2% 2005: 7.2% with, at 31st December 2006, a weighted average period of 3.1 years 2005: 4.1 years for which the rate is fixed.
The fair value of fixed rate sterling loans has been determined by discounting the future cash flows at a market rate of interest for similar debt instruments.
Fixed rate US dollar bank loans expose the Group to fair value interest and cash flow currency risks.
The cash flow currency risks have been hedged using swap arrangements as detailed at 17 iv.
The weighted average interest rate for fixed rate US dollar bank loans for 2006 was 5.6% 2005: 5.6% with, at 31st December 2006, a weighted average period of 7.3 years 2005: 8.3 years for which the rate is fixed.
The fair value of fixed rate US dollar loans has been determined by discounting the future cash flows at a market rate of interest for similar debt instruments.
iv Derivative financial instruments Swap cash flow hedge The Group enters into derivative transactions in the form of swap arrangements to manage the cash flow risks arising from the Groups sources of finance.
As at 31st December 2006 the Group had outstanding long term US dollar debt of $100.0m 2005: $100.0m.
In obtaining this funding the Group sought to achieve certainty as to both the availability of, and income statement charge related to, a designated proportion of anticipated future debt requirements.
At the date of drawdown of the $100.0m of fixed rate US dollar debt the Group entered into swap arrangements to swap this to 62.0m of fixed rate sterling debt.
After taking into account swap arrangements the fixed interest rates applicable to the debt were as follows: Amount Fixed rate payable m % Maturity 21.7 5.625 4.9.
2015 The swap arrangements are designated as a cash flow hedge against future currency movements.
The fair value of the swap arrangements as at 31st December 2006, which is based on third party valuations, was 10.9m 2005: 5.8m with a loss of 5.1m 2005: 3.6m gain credited directly to equity in the year.
Of the cumulative gain on derivative financial liabilities 6.7m 2005: 5.6m loss was realised in the year and transferred to the income statement see note 4.
Equity share receivables The Group has entered into 1.8m 2005: 8.0m of equity share agreements on newly completed residential properties during the year.
Under these agreements, the Group retains a fixed proportion of the equity in a newly completed residential property until the date of first resale or ten years from the date of the agreement, whichever is the earlier, when it will receive the fixed proportion of the market value of the property.
All agreements are secured by way of a second charge over the property.
During the year, the Group has disposed of 0.2m 2005: nil of equity share agreements.
The agreements were initially recognised at market value, discounted at LIBOR over the expected length of time to the redemption of the agreements, being 3.5 years.
The Directors consider that this is the appropriate length of time over which to discount the equity share receivables.
The agreements are subsequently measured at fair value, which at the 31st December 2006 is estimated to be 8.8m 2005: 6.9m.
The fair value has been estimated using the average of data from national property price reports and applied on a national basis.
The combination of the initial discounting of the receivables and subsequent re-measurement at fair value has resulted in income of 0.3m 2005: 1.1m expense being included in cost of sales in the year.
There is no significant concentration of credit risk as exposure is spread over a number of customers and the agreements are secured by way of a second charge on the property.
Equity share receivables expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk as no interest is charged upon the receivable.
Wilson Bowden plc Annual Report 2006 59 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 18.
Financial risk management The Groups operations and debt financing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, foreign currency exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
The most significant of these to the Group is liquidity risk and as such there is a regular, detailed system for the reporting and forecasting of cash flows from the operations to Group management so as to ensure that risks are promptly identified and appropriate actions taken by the central Treasury Department.
In addition, the Group has in place a risk management programme that seeks to limit the adverse effects of the other risks on its financial performance by using financial instruments, including debt and derivatives, to fix foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The Board of Directors is responsible for setting the specific, clearly defined guidelines regarding treasury that are applied by the Group.
In addition, the Directors approve and review all facilities and derivative transactions.
The Group operates a central Treasury Department to implement the guidelines established by the Board, to whom it reports regularly.
a Foreign exchange rate risk The Group has outstanding US dollar denominated debt of $100.0m 2005: $100.0m.
In order to mitigate the foreign exchange rate risks, the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge the cash flow risk related to future foreign exchange and interest rate movements.
The cash flow hedge provides the Group with certainty as to the income statement charge related to this debt.
b Interest rate risk The Group has both interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities.
The Group has a policy of maintaining both long term fixed rate funding and medium term floating rate funding so as to ensure that there is appropriate flexibility for the Groups operational requirements.
As detailed in a above, the Group has entered into swap arrangements to hedge cash flow risks related to interest rate movements on a proportion of its debt.
c Credit risk The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Board of Directors.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit set by the Directors and is regularly reassessed.
d Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains a mixture of long term and medium term committed facilities that are designed to ensure that the Group has sufficient available funds for operations.
At 31st December 2006, the Group had committed facilities of 797.0m 2005: 732.0m and total facilities of 910.0m 2005: 810.0m.
