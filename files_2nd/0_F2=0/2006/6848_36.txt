NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 30 APRIL 2006 23.
Financial instruments The primary treasury objectives of the group are to identify and manage the financial risks that arise in relation to underlying business needs, and provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the group.
If appropriate, the group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks.
The principal financial instruments held for the purpose of raising finance for operations are bank loans and overdraft, securitised bonds, loan notes, cash and short term deposits.
Other financial instruments arise directly from the operations of the group, such as trade receivables, payables, and trade loans.
Derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, are used to manage the interest rate risks related to the group's operations and financing sources.
The main risks from the group's financial instruments are cash flow interest rate risk and credit risk.
The policy for managing each of these risks is set out below.
Interest rate risk Exposure to changes in interest rates on the group's borrowings is reviewed with regard to the maturity profile and cash flows of the underlying debt.
The group uses a mixture of fixed and floating interest rate debt with exposure to market interest rate fluctuations primarily arising from the floating rate instruments.
The group operates a policy that no less than 95% of the overall interest exposure should be hedged.
The group enters into interest rate swaps to manage the exposure.
The swaps are designated as cashflow hedges at the date of contract included within the accounts, and tested for effectiveness every 6 months.
Credit risk The policy for third party trading is that all customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures.
Receivable balances are also monitored on an on-going basis and provided against where deemed necessary to limit the exposure to bad debts to a non significant level.
Other financial assets includes trade loans, cash, and certain derivative instruments.
Credit risk is the risk of default by the counterparty to discharge their obligation, the maximum exposure of the group is the carrying amount of these instruments.
There is no requirement for collateral and there are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the group.
Cash flow hedging At 30 April 2006, the group held 23 2005 - 17 interest rate swap contracts, with a nominal value of 497.5m 2005 - 280.0m, designated as hedges of the cash flow interest rate risk of 497.5m 2005 - 280.0m of the group's variable rate borrowings excluding bonds, and are held on the balance sheet at a fair value liability of 17.3m 2005 - nil.
The cashflows occur quarterly and semi-annually, receiving a variable rate of interest based on the base rate or LIBOR, ranging from 4.50% to 4.95% 2005 - 4.44% to 5.01%, and paying a fixed rate ranging from 4.40% to 6.96% 2005 - 4.93% to 6.96%.
Remaining contract maturity dates range from September 2006 to October 2012.
At 30 April 2006, the group also held a 150m 2005 - 150m interest rate swap contract as a cash flow hedge of 150m 2005 - 150m of variable rate bonds whereby it receives a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR and pays fixed rate of 5.155% 2005 - 5.155%.
The contract maturity date is June 2034.
The bonds and interest rate swap have the same critical terms.
Changes in cash flow hedge fair values are recognised in the unrealised gains and losses reserve to the extent that the hedges are effective.
The cashflow hedges have been assessed as being highly effective during the period and are expected to remain highly effective over the remaining contract lives.
Accordingly a net unrealised gain of 4.1m has been recognised in equity, with a related deferred tax liability of 1.2m, in relation to the interest rate swaps.
As explained in the accounting policies although IAS 39 was implemented this year, the 2005 comparatives have not been adjusted for the impact of IAS 39.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2005 06 46 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 30 APRIL 2006 Interest rate risk The following tables set out the group's exposure to interest rate risk and the maturity profile for each class of interest bearing financial asset and financial liability.
The interest on fixed rate financial instruments is fixed until the maturity of the instrument.
Other financial assets above relates to trade loans receivable.
Included in the fixed rate trade loan balance is 8.0m which relates to loans with settlement related to purchase levels and which therefore do not have a set repayment profile.
The write-down of these loans has been taken on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the loan as the most prudent approximation.
This is not necessarily the actual write-down that will occur.
