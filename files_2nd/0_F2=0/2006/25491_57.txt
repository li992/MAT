Hedges The group uses derivatives for management of financial risks relating to its asset and liability portfolios, mainly associated with nontrading interest rate risks and exposures to foreign currency risk.
Most non-trading interest rate risk is transferred from the originating business to the central Treasury in the Treasury and Specialised Finance business.
Once aggregated and netted, Treasury, as the sole interface to the wholesale market for cash and derivative transactions, actively manages the liquidity mismatch and non-trading interest rate risk from our asset and liability portfolios.
In this regard, Treasury is required to exercise tight control of funding, liquidity, concentration and non-trading interest rate risk within defined parameters.
The accounting treatment of accounting hedges is dependant on the classification between fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and in particular, accounting hedges require the identification of a direct relationship between a hedged item and hedging instrument.
This relationship is established in limited circumstances based on the manner in which the group manages its risk exposure.
Below is a description of each category of accounting hedges achieved by the group.
Fair value hedges Fair value hedges are entered into mainly to hedge the exposure of changes in fair value of fixed rate financial instruments attributable to interest rates.

The aggregate expected cash flows are hedged based on cash flow forecasts with reference to terms and conditions present in the affected contractual arrangements.
Changes in fair value are initially recognised in equity and transferred to the income statement when the cash flow occurs.
