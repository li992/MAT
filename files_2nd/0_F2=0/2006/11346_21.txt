Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards including FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date.
The accounting policies have been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of FRS 18.
The directors consider the following accounting policies to be relevant in relation to the Companys financial statements.
The Companys financial statements are included in the consolidated financial statements of Northumbrian Water Group plc.
Accordingly, the Company has taken advantage of the exemption from preparing a profit and loss account and cash flow statement.
The Company is also exempt from disclosing related party transactions with subsidiaries of NWG.
b Prior year adjustment The Company has adopted FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date in these financial statements.
Dividends are now accrued where an obligation exists at the balance sheet date.
Consequently, dividends which the Company approves in a general meeting at the balance sheet date are no longer accrued, but are required to be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
The prior year comparative figures have been restated to reflect the dividends paid in that year, in accordance with the first year adoption requirements of FRS 21. c turnover Turnover, which excludes value added tax, represents the income receivable in the ordinary course of business for goods and services provided.
d Fixed asset investments Fixed asset investments are stated at their purchase cost, less any provision for impairment.
e taxation Corporation tax is based on the profit for the period as adjusted for taxation purposes using the rates of tax enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provision is made for deferred tax in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in future periods.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing differences are expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As permitted by FRS 19, the Company has decided to adopt a policy of discounting deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the time value of money over the period between the balance sheet date and the dates on which it is estimated that the underlying timing differences will reverse.
The discount rates used reflect the post-tax yields to maturity that can be obtained at the balance sheet date on UK Government bonds with similar maturity dates to those of the deferred tax assets or liabilities.
f share-based compensation arrangements In accordance with UITF 17 Employee share schemes, the costs of long term incentive awards to executive directors and senior managers in accordance with the Companys long term incentive plan see the directors remuneration report are expensed on a straight line basis over the period in which performance is measured.
The amount to be expensed is based upon an estimate of the probability that the performance criteria will be met.
In accordance with UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts, until such time as the Companys own shares held by the trust vest unconditionally in employees, the consideration paid for the shares will be deducted from shareholders funds.
