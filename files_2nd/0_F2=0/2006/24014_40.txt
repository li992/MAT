26 Fund risk profile The Company is an Investment Company and conducts its affairs so as to qualify as an investment trust under the provisions of Section 842 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act, 1988.
In so doing, the Company is exempted from corporation tax on capital gains on its portfolio of investments.
The Companys investment objective is to secure long-term growth in capital and income through a diversified international portfolio of equities, with the use of gearing.
The large number of listed investments held in the Companys portfolio over 700 at 31 December 2006, together with the industrial and geographical diversity of the portfolio shown on pages 5 to 12 and in note 16 on the accounts enables the Company to spread its risks with regard to liquidity, market volatility, currency movements and revenue streams.
In addition, the ability of the Company to gear up via long-term and short-term borrowings, in currencies matching those to which the portfolio is exposed, enables it to take a long-term view of the countries and markets in which it is invested, without having to be concerned about short-term volatility.
The Company has not normally invested in derivative products.
The Companys principal financial risks, and the Directors approach to management of those risks, are set out in the table on page 58.
