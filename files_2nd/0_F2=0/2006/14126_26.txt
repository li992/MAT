Company financial statements Notes to the company financial statements 1 Accounting policies a Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention as modied by the revaluation of financial assets and liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit and loss and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and comply with the requirements of the United Kingdom Companies Act 1985 the Act.
The company has adopted the following accounting standards during the year: FRS 20 Share based payments FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date FRS 23 The effects of foreign exchange rates FRS 24 Financial reporting in hyperinationary economies FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and presentation FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement The adoption of FRS 20 has decreased current assets by 0.3 million, decreased creditors due within one year by 5.6 million, increased investments by 1.5 million and increased retained earnings by 6.8 million for year ended 31 March 2005.
The adoption of FRS 21 has decreased creditors due within the year and increased retained earnings by 104.6 million for year ended 31 March 2005 due to the deferral of the final dividend for 04 05 until it is approved at the Annual General Meeting.
FRS 25 and FRS 26 were adopted from 1 April 2005.
There is no restatement of the prior year gures.
Further details of the changes in accounting policies are given below.
Details of the impact of this are given in note 14.
Further details as to the adjustments on adoption are given in note 14.
The remaining standards have no material effects on the financial statements.
b Tangible xed assets and depreciation Tangible xed assets are included at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Freehold land is not depreciated.
Other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated economic lives, which are principally as follows: Years Buildings 30-60 Vehicles, computers and software 2-15 c Leased assets Where assets are nanced by leasing arrangements which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an asset to the lessee finance leases, the assets are accounted for as if they had been purchased and the fair values of minimum lease payments are shown as an obligation to the lessor.
Lease payments are treated as consisting of a capital element and a finance charge, the capital element reducing the obligation to the lessor and the finance charge being written off to the profit and loss account over the period of the lease in proportion to the capital amount outstanding.
Depreciation is charged over the shorter of the estimated useful life and the lease period.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases.
Rental costs arising under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
d Impairment of xed assets and investments Impairments of xed assets and investments are calculated as the difference between the carrying value of net assets of income generating units, including where appropriate investments and goodwill, and their recoverable amounts.
Recoverable amount is dened as the higher of net realisable value or estimated value in use at the date the impairment review is undertaken.
Net realisable value represents the net amount that can be generated through sale of assets.
Value in use represents the present value of expected future cash ows discounted on a pre-tax basis, using the estimated cost of capital of the income generating unit.
Impairment reviews are carried out if there is some indication that an impairment may have occurred, or, where otherwise required, to ensure that goodwill and xed assets are not carried above their estimated recoverable amounts.
Impairments are recognised in the profit and loss account and, where material, are disclosed as exceptional.
e Financial instruments The group has adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 during the year.
The accounting policy after 1 April 2005 is as follows: Debt instruments All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at cost, being the net fair value of the consideration received.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Where a loan or borrowing is in a fair value hedging relationship it is remeasured for changes in fair value of the hedged risk at the balance sheet date with gains or losses being recognised in the income statement see below.
Gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account when the liabilities are derecognised or impaired, as well as through the amortisation process.
Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 105 Company financial statements Notes to the company financial statements continued Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities The group uses derivative financial instruments such as cross currency swaps, forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate uctuations.
Such derivative instruments are initially recorded at cost and subsequently remeasured at fair value for the reported balance sheet.
The fair value of cross currency swaps, interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts is calculated by reference to market exchange rates and interest rates at the period end.
In relation to fair value hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is taken to the profit and loss account where the effective portion of the hedge will offset the gain or loss on the hedged item see above.
In relation to cash ow hedges which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognised directly in reserves, and the ineffective portion in the profit and loss account.
The gains or losses deferred in reserves in this way are recycled through the profit and loss account in the same period in which the hedged underlying transaction or rm commitment is recognised in the profit and loss account.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, gains or losses are taken directly to the profit and loss account in the period.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires, is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualies for hedge accounting.
At that date any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in reserves is kept in reserves until the forecast transaction occurs, or transferred to the profit and loss account if the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contract or the host contract is not carried at fair value with gains and losses reported in the profit and loss account.
The accounting policy prior to 1 April 2005 is as follows: Debt instruments The financial costs of debt instruments are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the debt at a constant rate on the carrying amount.
Such costs include the cost of issue and any discount to face value arising on issue, or any premium arising on maturity.
Differences arising from the movement in exchange rates during the year on translation into sterling of the foreign currency borrowings and similar instruments used to finance long-term equity investments, are taken directly to reserves and reported in the statement of total recognised gains and losses.
Derivative financial instruments Financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and to a lesser extent currency swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business activities of the company and the nancing of those activities.
There is no trading activity in financial instruments.
A review of how the financial risks are managed is included in note 19 of the group financial statements.
Financial instruments are accounted for as follows: interest rate swaps are used to hedge the companys exposure to movements in interest rates.
The interest payable or receivable on such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits or borrowings.
Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior to maturity.
currency swaps are used to hedge foreign currency borrowings.
The future currency exchange within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date.
The interest coupon on such swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
f Investments After initial recognition at cost being the fair value of the consideration paid, investments which are classied as held for trading or available for sale are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognised in income or equity respectively.
When an available for sale investment is disposed of, or impaired, the gain or loss previously recognised in reserves is taken to the profit and loss account.
Other investments are classied as held to maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Investments held for an undefined period are excluded from this classication.
Such investments and those held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with any gains or losses being recognised in the profit and loss account.
Prior to 1 April 2005, the company held investments at historical cost less any provision for impairment.
106 Severn Trent Plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Company financial statements g Share-based payments The company operates a number of equity settled, share-based compensation plans for employees.
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant is recognised as an expense over the vesting period of the grant.
The fair value of employee services is determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted calculated using a pricing model, excluding the impact of any non-market conditions.
The number of awards expected to vest takes into account non-market vesting conditions including, where appropriate, continuing employment by the group.
The charge is adjusted to reect shares that do not vest as a result of failing to meet a non-market based condition.
h Cash ow statement The company has taken advantage of the exemption under Financial Reporting Statement 1 Cash ow statements and not produced a cash ow statement.
i Deferred taxation Deferred taxation is fully provided for in respect of timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes only to the extent that the group has an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that taxable profits are expected to arise in the future.
Material deferred taxation balances arising are discounted by applying an appropriate risk free discount rate.
