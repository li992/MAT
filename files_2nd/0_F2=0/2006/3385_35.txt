CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Bank balances and cash comprise cash held by the Group and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
The carrying amount of these assets approximates to their fair value.
19. CREDIT AND PRICE RISK The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, and trade and other receivables, which represent the Groups maximum exposure to credit risk in relation to financial assets.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The amounts presented in the Balance Sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, based on prior experience and an assessment of the current economic environment.
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating agencies.
The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers.
The Groups price risk is principally in relation to the cost of raw materials and is not considered significant.
Price risk is managed through negotiations with suppliers and where appropriate the agreement of fixed price supply contracts.
