Share-based payments During the year ended 31 December 2006 the Group operated a number of different equity settled share-based payment arrangements, which are aggregated as follows: SAYE plan this is a standard HMRC approved scheme that is available to all employees where individuals can contribute up to 250 per month over three years to purchase shares at a price not less than 80% of the market price at the date of the invitation to participate.
Executive deferred bonus schemes under these plans the deferred element of the annual bonus is used to purchase shares at market value in the Company.
The shares are held by the Company until vesting after three years and, in addition to the performance targets, which apply prior to any entitlement being granted, further performance conditions may also apply on vesting.
Executive performance share plan under this plan, which was introduced in 2005, two-thirds of shares are subject to an earnings growth condition of the Group and one-third of shares are subject to a comparative total shareholder return condition, both measured over a single three year period.
Further information regarding the vesting conditions of the earnings growth and total shareholder return dependent portions of the award is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 44 to 46.
Executive share option schemes these include both approved and unapproved elements and vest after three or five year periods subject to satisfying personal and or Group earnings performance.

2 In 2006, the vesting period for the SAYE plan was 3 years.
In prior years the vesting periods for the SAYE plan were 3 or 5 years and this results in having two fair values in the table above for awards made in 2003, 2004 and 2005.
These vesting periods may be extended by up to six months in order to catch up on missed contributions up to a maximum of 6.
3 There are two populations of the executive deferred bonus schemes, one of which is subject to performance conditions on vesting as well as the initial performance criteria which apply prior to any entitlements being granted to both populations.
There are therefore two fair values in the table above with the lower value in each case being relevant to the portion subject to further performance criteria on vesting.
4 Dividends payable on the shares during the vesting period are paid out during the vesting period for the executive deferred bonus schemes and so no dividend yield assumption is required.
5 The awards made under the executive performance share plan are dependent upon earnings growth in the Company two-thirds of the award and a total shareholder return of a comparator group of companies one-third of the award.
This results in having two fair values for each of the awards made in the table above, the first being in relation to the comparator total shareholder return and the second relating to the Companys earnings growth.
6 Awards were made under the executive performance share plan on eight separate occasions during 2006.
The SAYE plan options outstanding at 31 December 2006 had exercise prices of 72 pence, 144 pence, 194 pence and 244 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.6 years.
100 St. Jamess Place plc Report & Accounts 2006 208983 St James RA Txt 23 3 07 13:05 Page 102 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts under International Financial Reporting Standards continued The options outstanding under the executive share option schemes at 31 December 2006 had exercise prices ranging from 85.5 pence to 257 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.5 years.
The options outstanding under the sales management share option schemes at 31 December 2006 had exercise prices ranging from 80 pence to 242 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.0 years.
The options outstanding under the Partner share option schemes at 31 December 2006 had exercise prices ranging from 75 pence to 408 pence and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.2 years.
Early exercise assumptions The following allowance has been made for the impact of early exercise once options have vested: 1 SAYE plan all option holders are assumed to exercise half-way through the six month exercise window.
2 Executive, sales management and partner share option schemes it is assumed that 10% of option holders are forced to exercise their options each year irrespective of the level of the share price.
For the remainder it is assumed that one-half will exercise their options each year if the share price is at least 33% above the exercise price.
Allowance for performance conditions The executive performance share plan includes a market based performance condition based on the Companys total shareholder return relative to an index of comparator companies.
The impact of this performance condition has been modelled using Monte Carlo simulation techniques, which involve running many thousands of simulations of future share price movements for both the Company and the comparator index.
For the purpose of these simulations it is assumed that the share price of the Company and the comparator index are 20% correlated and that the comparator index has volatilities ranging between 21% pa and 45% pa.
The performance condition is based on the Companys performance relative to the comparator index over a three year period commencing on 1 January each year.
The fair value calculations for the awards that were made in 2006 therefore include an allowance for the actual performance of the Companys share price relative to the index over the period between 1 January 2006 and the various award dates.
