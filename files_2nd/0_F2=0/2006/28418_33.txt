Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements G: Financial assets and liabilities G1: Financial instruments designation and fair values The Group designates all financial assets as either fair value through profit and loss, available-for-sale, or as loans and receivables.
Financial liabilities are designated as either fair value through profit and loss or amortised cost, or for investment contracts with discretionary participation features accounted for under IFRS 4 as described in note A4.

ii See note G3 for details of the derivative assets included.
The balance also contains the PAC with-profits funds participation in various investment funds and limited liability property partnerships.
iii It is impractical to determine the fair value of investment contracts with discretionary participation features due to the lack of a reliable basis to measure such features.
Determination of fair value F The fair values of the Groups quoted investments are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers, or by using valuation techniques.
The fair value of investments valued using a valuation technique at 31 December 2006 was 4,548 million 31 December 2005: 4,947 million.
The valuation techniques include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that G are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, option adjusted spread models and enterprise valuation and may include a number of assumptions relating to variables such as credit risk and interest rates.
Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these instruments.
The fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based upon available market information and judgements about the financial H instruments, including estimates of the timing and amount of expected future cash flows and the credit standing of counterparties.
Such estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the Groups entire holdings of a particular financial instrument, nor do they consider the tax impact of the realisation of unrealised gains or losses.
In some cases the fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets, nor can the disclosed value be realised in immediate settlement of the financial instrument.
I The loans and receivables have been shown net of provisions for impairment.
The fair value of loans has been estimated from discounted cash flows expected to be received.
The rate of discount used was the market rate of interest.
The estimated fair value of derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amount the Group would receive or pay in an arms length transaction.
This amount is determined using quotations from independent third parties or valued internally using standard market practices.
In accordance with the Groups risk management framework, all internally generated valuations are subject to independent assessment against external counterparties valuations.
The fair value of borrowings is based on quoted market prices, where available.
Refer to section A4 for the determination of fair value for investment contracts without fixed and guaranteed terms notably UK unitlinked policies.
For investment contracts in the US with fixed and guaranteed terms the fair value is determined based on the present value of future cash flows discounted at current interest rates.
The fair value of other financial liabilities is determined using discounted cash flows of the amounts expected to be paid.
190 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements G1: Financial instruments designation and fair values continued Use of valuation techniques Valuation techniques UK Of the financial investments that are not quoted on active markets, assets with a fair value at 31 December 2006 of 3,959 million 2005: 3,729 million were held by UK operations.
3,563 million 2005: 3,466 million of this amount related to assets held by with-profits A operations and 396 million 2005: 263 million related to assets held by the shareholder-backed UK annuity subsidiary Prudential Retirement Income Limited PRIL.
The majority of these assets are private debt securities such as private placements, project finance, asset securitisations and local authority securities.
The securities are mainly long-dated and not regularly traded and are valued internally using market standard practices.
These practices mainly use matrix pricing, which is based on assessing credit quality of the underlying B borrower to derive a suitable discount rate relative to government securities.
In accordance with the Groups Risk Management Framework, all internally generated calculations are subject to independent assessment by the Groups Fair Value Committees which comprise members who are independent of the fund managers involved in the day-to-day trading in these assets.
C The total amount of the change in fair value estimation using valuation techniques, including valuation techniques based on assumptions not wholly supported by observable market prices or rates, recognised in the profit and loss account in 2006 was a loss of 63 million 2005: a gain of 82 million for the with-profits fund investments.
Changes in values of assets of the with-profits funds are reflected in policyholder liabilities and unallocated surplus.
Due to the liability accounting treatment of unallocated surplus, changes in values of securities held by with-profits funds have no direct effect on the profit or loss or shareholders equity.
D The total amount of the change in fair value estimation using valuation techniques, including those based on assumptions not wholly supported by observable market prices or rates, recognised in the profit and loss account in 2006 and which was attributable to shareholders, was a loss of 12 million 2005: a gain of 11 million for the PRIL investments.
E Valuation techniques US The other financial investments which are not quoted on active markets were assets held by Jackson that had a fair value of 589 million 2005: 1,218 million.
The US operations of Prudential had two groups of assets which were valued using valuation techniques derivatives that are accounted F for under IAS 39 on a fair value through profit and loss basis and securities held by the Piedmont trust entity, an 80 per cent Jackson held static trust formed as a result of a securitisation of asset-backed securities in 2003 that are accounted for on an available-for-sale basis.
As at 31 December 2006, the fair value of the derivative and Piedmont assets valued using valuation techniques was 184 million and 405 million, respectively 2005: 518 million and 700 million respectively.
G The majority of the factors entering into the valuation of the derivatives are readily observable in the market and, therefore, are not subject to interpretation in the model.
The most significant non-observable factor is the level of implied volatility assumed in the valuation.
Significant estimates and judgements are also employed in valuing certain asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities held by the Piedmont trust entity.
These valuations may impact reported shareholder profit and loss amounts through the determination of impairment and recovery amounts.
While management believes that the estimates and assumptions employed in developing the fair value estimates H are reasonable and present managements best estimate of such values, a reasonable range of values exists with respect to most assumptions utilised in determining these values.
As a result of the potentially significant variability in the estimates of the assumptions used in these models, the range of reasonable estimates of the fair value of these securities is significant.
Management has obtained broker bids on these securities that represent the value at which the Group could sell the investments, if I forced.
These bids are not based on full knowledge and hence analysis of the investments, but represent the best estimate of the worst case decline in market value of these securities.
The broker bids for these securities at 31 December 2006 totalled 372 million, a difference of 33 million 2005: 514 million, a difference of 186 million.
Interest income and expense The interest income on financial assets not at fair value through profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2006 was 2,775 million 2005: 2,662 million.
The interest expense on financial liabilities not at fair value through profit and loss for the year ended 31 December 2006 was 890 million 2005: 893 million.

A The financial assets, of which 90 per cent 2005: 86 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, allow the PAC with-profits fund to obtain exposure to foreign equity markets.
The financial liabilities, of which 14 per cent 2005: 22 per cent are held by the PAC with-profits fund, mainly relate to foreign currency borrowings.
B The exchange risks inherent in these exposures are mitigated through the use of derivatives, mainly forward currency contracts note G3 below.
The amount of exchange gains recognised in the income statement in 2006, except for those arising on financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss, is 73 million 2005: 152 million.

I These derivatives are used for efficient portfolio management to obtain cost effective and efficient exposure to various markets in accordance with the Groups investment strategies and to manage exposure to interest rate, currency, credit and other business risks.
See also note D3 for use of derivatives by the Groups US operations.
The Group uses various interest rate derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps to reduce exposure to interest rate volatility.
The UK insurance operations use various currency derivatives in order to limit volatility due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations arising on securities denominated in currencies other than sterling.
In addition, total return swaps and interest rate swaps are held for efficient portfolio management.
As part of the efficient portfolio management of the PAC with-profits fund, the fund may, from time to time, invest in cash-settled forward contracts over Prudential plc shares, which are accounted for consistently with other derivatives.
This is in order to avoid a mismatch of the with-profits investment portfolio with the investment benchmarks set for its equity-based investment funds.
The contracts will form part of the long-term investments of the with-profits fund.
These contracts are subject to a number of limitations for legal and regulatory reasons.
196 Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 Primary Parent statements company EEV Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements G3: Derivatives and hedging continued Some of the Groups products, especially those sold in the US, have certain guarantee features linked to equity indexes.
A mismatch between product liabilities and the performance of the underlying assets backing them, exposes the Group to equity index risk.
In order to mitigate this risk, the relevant business units purchase swaptions, equity options and futures to match asset performance with liabilities under equity-indexed products.
A The US operations and some of the UK operations hold large amounts of interest-rate sensitive investments that contain credit risks on which a certain level of defaults is expected.
These entities have purchased some swaptions in order to manage the default risk on certain underlying assets and hence reduce the amount of regulatory capital held to support the assets.
B Egg uses derivative instruments for the purpose of supporting the strategic and operational business activities and reducing and eliminating the risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates.
Derivatives are used solely to hedge risk exposures and Egg does not take any trading position in derivatives.
For the purpose of reducing interest rate risk, Egg uses a number of derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps and forward agreements.
Additionally, swaps are used to provide caps to the funding cost of the credit card product.
C Egg has also made general use of credit default swaps to manage credit risk without changing the underlying product or investment portfolios.
For the purpose of reducing currency risk, Egg uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps.

Prudential plc Annual Report 2006 197 Primary Parent EEV statements company Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements Notes on the Group financial statements continued G4: Derecognition, securitisation and collateral Securities lending and reverse repurchase agreements The Group has entered into securities lending including repurchase agreements whereby blocks of securities are loaned to third parties, primarily major brokerage firms.
The agreements require that amounts between 102 per cent and 105 per cent of the fair value of the loaned securities be held as collateral, depending on the quality of the collateral, calculated on a daily basis.
The loaned securities are not A removed from the Groups consolidated balance sheet, rather they are retained within the appropriate investment classification.
Collateral typically consists of cash, debt securities, equity securities and letters of credit.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had lent 11,418 million 2005: 10,594 million of which 7,592 million 2005: 8,250 million was lent by the PAC with-profits fund of securities and held collateral under such agreements of 11,814 million 2005: 11,112 million of which 7,934 million 2005: 8,657 million was held B by the PAC with-profits fund.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into reverse repurchase transactions under which it purchased securities and had taken on the obligation to resell the securities for the purchase price of 1,435 million 2005: 1,214 million, together with accrued interest.
Collateral and pledges under derivative transactions C At 31 December 2006, the Group had pledged 263 million 2005: 403 million for liabilities and held collateral of 212 million 2005: 193 million in respect of over-the-counter derivative transactions.
Securitisation During 2006, Egg transferred additional UK credit card receivables to its trust vehicle, Arch Term Limited, created in 2002 for the D purpose of asset-backed securitisation, bringing the outstanding balance of assets in this vehicle to 2.8 billion 2005: 2.8 billion.
The noteholders in securitisations from this vehicle have a proportional interest in each account balance in the trust.
As at 31 December 2006, the value of this interest was 2.3 billion 2005: 2.3 billion.
This securitisation does not qualify for derecognition under IAS 39 and the total portfolio is, therefore, included in loans and receivables.
The funding giving rise to the note-holders interest is included within operational borrowings attributable to shareholder-financed operations.
E G5: Impairment of financial assets In accordance with the Groups accounting policy set out in note A4, impairment reviews were performed for available-for-sale securities F and loans and receivables.
In addition, impairment reviews were undertaken for the reinsurers share of policyholder liability provisions.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, impairment losses of 416 million 2005: 278 million were recognised.
These were mainly for loans and advances to customers in Egg and available-for-sale securities held by Jackson.
Impairment losses recognised on available-for-sale securities amounted to 24 million 2005: 24 million.
Of this amount, 76 per cent G 2005: 28 per cent has been recorded on structured asset-backed securities, primarily due to reduced cash flow expectations on such securities that are collateralised by diversified pools of primarily below investment grade securities.
22 per cent 2005: 53 per cent of the losses related to the impairment of fixed maturity securities of two 2005: five individual corporate issuers, reflecting deteriorating business outlook of the companies concerned.
H The impairment losses have been recorded in acquisition costs and other operating expenditure in the income statement.
In 2006, the Group realised gross losses on sales of available-for-sale securities of 58 million 2005: 29 million.
30 per cent 2005: 38 per cent of these losses related to the disposal of fixed maturity securities of six 2005: five individual issuers, which were disposed of to rebalance the portfolio in the US operations.
I The effect of those reasonably likely changes in the key assumptions underlying the estimates that underpin the assessment of whether impairment has taken place depends on the factors described in note A3.
A key indicator of whether such impairment may arise in future, and the potential amounts at risk, is the profile of gross unrealised losses for fixed maturity and equity securities accounted for on an available-for-sale basis by reference to the time periods by which the securities have been held continuously in an unrealised loss position and by reference to the maturity date of the securities concerned.
