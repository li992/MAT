Financial review This was the first full year of corporate tax at Morila and the The results for the year reflect the group incurred an income tax charge of US$23.1 million for successful progression of the the year 2005: US$0.2 million.
Net profit for the year of companys profitable growth US$50.9 million was up by 6% compared to the previous year.

were partially offset by lower grades resulting in lower production at Morila and increased costs.
Gold prices averaged US$604 oz compared to US$445 oz in 2005.
Attributable production was up for the third successive year at 448 242 ounces assuming 100% of Loulos production 399 927 ounces assuming 80% of Loulos production as compared to 314 831 ounces in 2005 and 204 194 ounces in 2004.
Earnings per share of 70 cents were in line with the 74 cents of 2005 restated and up on 32 cents in 2004.
Cash operating costs for the group were US$258 oz, up from US$169 oz in 2005 restated.
After royalties, total cash costs for the group were US$296 oz for the year compared to US$201 oz in 2005 restated.
This compares to an average for the industry which is now over US$350 oz.
Industry wide cost pressures have continued this year resulting from the weak dollar, high diesel, steel and contract mining costs.
Diesel comprised approximately 25% of the production costs in the year.
Contract mining costs make up over 30% of production costs.
Despite these cost pressures, costs have been well controlled at both locations and the lower grade processed is the main factor in the increased cost per ounce.
Grades at Morila decreased from 5.9g t in 2005 to 4.2g t this year, and at Loulo from 4.5g t to 3.2g t as per the respective Life of Mine plans.
However on a cost per tonne basis, Morila performed well by keeping costs steady at just over US$33 tonne and Loulos increase year-on-year of 10% to just over US$30 tonne is explained by the introduction of hard rock mining and crushing.
Expenditure on exploration and corporate costs continues to be an important investment with US$29 million being spent in the year compared to last years US$24 million.
Extensive drilling programmes were undertaken in all countries in which the company operates except for Ghana.

Randgold Resources then Yalea, Sadiola, Segala, Tabakoto undertook detailed exploration which resulted in the discovery and Sabodala, across the border in of the Yalea deposit.
Following the acceptance of a bankable feasibility study in 1999, by the board of directors of Somilo, Senegal.
Randgold Resources exercised its option to increase its participation in the project to 51%.
However, the project was put on hold with the subsequent drop in the gold price to US$250 oz.
In 2001, Randgold Resources also acquired the 29% La Source share in Somilo, raising its stake to 80%, with the government of Mali holding the remaining 20%.
As a result of a gold price recovery in 2003 and the completion of a successful exploration drilling campaign which added significant confidence to Randgold Resources knowledge of the orebodies and highlighted the potential of significantly more reserve ounces at depth with respect to both Yalea and Gara, a revised feasibility study was conducted and demonstrated that the project met the companys investment return guidelines.
The Randgold Resources board then approved the investment in Somilo, which facilitated the development of the Loulo mine.
The Loulo mine was officially opened on 12 November 2005.
On 30 December 2005, notice was given to the main construction contractor and Randgold Resources capital projects team took over completing the hard rock crushing and related phase II circuits, which had fallen behind schedule.
Despite delays caused by the late commissioning of the hard rock crushing circuit, throughput in 2006 was maintained at levels above the design specification.
This resulted in production of 241 575 ounces for the year, only marginally below expectations, mainly as a result of not being in a position to feed as much of the originally planned higher grade hard ore.
