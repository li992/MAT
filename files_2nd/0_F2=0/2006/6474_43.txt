23 Financial instruments The Groups treasury operations are managed by the Group Finance Department.
Financial instruments are only permitted for use in managing financial risk arising from the Groups operations on the authority of the Board.
The Groups policies as regards derivatives and financial instruments are set out in the accounting policies.
The main financial risks faced by the Group relate to credit and interest rates.
The policies for managing these risks are summarised below: Credit risk Management has a credit policy in place and the exposure to credit risk is monitored on an ongoing basis.
Credit evaluations are performed on customers with potential credit exposure over certain amounts.
The Group does not require collateral in respect of financial assets.
At the balance sheet date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset, including derivative financial instruments, in the balance sheet.
Interest rate risk The Group uses derivatives to protect against fluctuating interest rates.
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Groups policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Interest rates swaps, in sterling, have been entered into to achieve a suitable mix of fixed and floating rate exposure.
The swaps mature over the next one to four years and have fixed rates ranging from 4.6425% to 4.87%.
At 31 March 2006 the Group had interest rate swaps with a notional contract amount of 45 million 2005: nil.
These interest rate swaps are stated at fair value.
Effective interest rates and repricing analysis In respect of income-earning financial assets and interest-bearing financial liabilities, the following table indicates their effective interest rates at the balance sheet date and the periods in which they mature or, if earlier, are repriced.
2006 2005 Effective Effective interest rate Total 0-1 years 1-5 years interest rate Total 0-1 years % 000 000 000 % 000 000 Cash and cash equivalents 3.6 6,079 6,079 285 285 Interest rate swaps 115 38 153 Secured bank loans 5.1 82,000 82,000 5.7 20,000 20,000 Bank overdrafts 5.7 13,356 13,356 75,806 6,041 81,847 33,071 33,071 Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
Over the longer-term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
Fair values The fair values together with the carrying amounts shown in the balance sheet are as follows: Carrying Carrying amount Fair value amount Fair value 2006 2006 2005 2005 000 000 000 000 Available-for-sale investment 929 929 Trade and other receivables 39,761 39,761 23,508 23,508 Cash and cash equivalents 6,079 6,079 285 285 Interest rate swaps 115 115 Secured bank loans 82,000 82,000 20,000 20,000 Trade and other payables 40,681 40,681 24,215 24,215 Bank overdraft 13,356 13,356 Unrecognised losses 75,797 75,797 33,778 33,778 Estimation of fair values The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in the tables: Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash flows.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables and payables the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair value.
The impact of discounting for those due after more than one year is not deemed to be significant.
