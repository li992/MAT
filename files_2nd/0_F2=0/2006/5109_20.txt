Notes forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation easyJets the Groups or the Companys financial statements are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain respects from IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB.
However the consolidated financial statements for the periods presented would be no different had the Group applied IFRS as issued by the IASB.
References to IFRS hereafter should be construed as references to IFRS as adopted by the EU.
These financial statements are prepared on the historical cost convention except for certain financial assets and liabilities including derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value and aircraft whose fair values were deemed as their cost on adoption of IFRS.
easyJet has historically prepared its audited annual financial statements under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice UK GAAP and this is the first year that easyJet has prepared financial statements that comply with IFRS.
As such, the accounting policies and basis of preparation differ from those set out in the report and accounts for the year ended 30 September 2005.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1, First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards for the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are included in the notes to the financial statements.
As permitted under IFRS 1, easyJet elected to apply the provisions of IAS 32, Financial Instruments Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments Recognition and Measurement from 1 October 2005 and applied the exemption not to restate its comparative information for the impact of these standards.
The impact of adopting IAS 32 and IAS 39 is explained below.
Significant judgements and estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, events or actions may mean that actual results ultimately differ from those estimates.
The policies used in determining aircraft maintenance liabilities, and corporation tax are material to easyJets financial statements and require a significant amount of management judgement.
Further details are given in the critical accounting policies section of the operational and financial review.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate those of easyJet plc and its subsidiaries for the years, made up to 30 September 2005 and 2006, together with the attributable share of results and reserves of associated undertakings, adjusted where appropriate to conform with easyJets accounting policies.
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by easyJet.
Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to benefit from its activities.
A minority interest is the portion of the profit or loss and net assets of a subsidiary attributable to equity interests that are not owned, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, by the Company.
Associates are those entities in which easyJet has significant influence, but not control over the financial and operating policies.
Associates are equity accounted for.
Intergroup balances and transactions and any unrealised gains and losses arising from intragroup transactions, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
Revenue recognition Revenues comprise the invoiced value of airline services, net of passenger taxes, discounts, plus ancillary and advertising revenue.
Revenue from the sale of flight seats passenger revenue is recognised in the period in which the service is provided.
Unearned revenue represents flight seats sold but not yet flown and is included in trade and other payables.
Ancillary revenues include: credit card fees, excess baggage charges, sporting equipment fees, infant fees, change fees and rescue fees: profit share from in-flight sales of food, beverages and boutique items: commissions received from products and services sold such as hotel and car hire bookings, and travel insurance: less chargebacks.
These are recognised on the date that the right to receive consideration occurs.
Financial instruments policy effective 1 October 2005 Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when easyJet becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.
Non-derivative financial assets are classified as loans and receivables, cash and cash equivalents, deposits maturing in between three months and one year, or deposits maturing in greater than one year.
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand or maturing within three months of inception, less any overdrafts repayable on demand.
Restricted cash comprises cash deposits which have restrictions governing its use, all of which expire in more than three months from inception of the deposit.
Classification of restricted cash as a current or non-current asset is based on the remaining length of the restriction governing its use.
Annual report and accounts 2006 67 plc Low cost with care convenience Notes continued forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Loans are initially recorded at fair value of net proceeds.
They are then stated at their amortised cost which is based on the effective interest rate method.
Non-derivative financial liabilities are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
For borrowings, their carrying value includes accrued interest payable and any unamortised issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments are used by easyJet to hedge its exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates and jet fuel prices, as well as for translation protection of balance sheet assets and liabilities.
Derivative financial assets and liabilities are stated at fair value.
All derivatives to which hedge accounting is applied are designated as cash flow hedges.
Changes to fair values are recognised directly in equity, to the extent that they are effective, with the ineffective portion being recognised in the income statement.
With respect to zero cost collars, the movement in the intrinsic value of derivatives is taken to reserves and the time value portion is taken to the income statement.
As easyJets hedging instruments primarily comprise zero cost collars, the income statement impact of time value will revert to zero over the full life of the instrument.
Where the hedged item results in a non-financial asset, the accumulated gains and losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial carrying value of the asset.
Otherwise accumulated gains and losses are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects the income statement.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when a hedging instrument is derecognised e. g. through expiry or disposal, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
Where the hedged item is a highly probable forecast transaction, the related gains and losses remain in equity until the transaction takes place, when they are removed from equity and recognised in the income statement.
When a hedged future transaction is no longer expected to occur, any related gains and losses previously recognised in equity are immediately recognised in the income statement.
Where derivatives have been entered into for translation protection of balance sheet assets and liabilities, hedge accounting is not applied.
Movements in fair values of these instruments are taken to the income statement in the month that they occur, to set off gains and losses resulting from the retranslation of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities.
Financial instruments policy until 30 September 2005 Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement when realised as an offset to the related income or expense, as the Group does not enter into any such transactions for speculative purposes.
Costs of procuring derivative financial instruments are held in debtors and matched against the period to which they relate.
Foreign currencies The primary economic environment in which an easyJet subsidiary operates determines its functional currency.
The functional currency of easyJet plc is considered to be sterling.
Certain subsidiaries have operations that are primarily influenced by a currency other than sterling.
Exchange differences arising on the translation of these foreign operations are taken to reserves until all or part of the interest is sold, when the relevant portion of the exchange is recognised in income.
Under IFRS 1, exchange differences arising prior to 1 October 2004 are deemed to be nil.
Profits and losses of foreign operations are translated into sterling at average rates of exchange during the year.
Transactions arising in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, other than as referred to above, are translated in to sterling using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains or losses on translation are included in the consolidated income statement.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the transactions were effected.
Leases Rental charges on operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
easyJet enters into sale and leaseback transactions whereby it sells to a third party rights to acquire aircraft.
On delivery of the aircraft, easyJet subsequently leases the aircraft back, by way of operating lease.
Any excess on the disposal, where the price that the aircraft is sold for is not considered to be fair value, is deferred and amortised over the lease term of the asset.
Purchase rights being the amount of pre-delivery deposits paid for aircraft that are expected to be sold and leased back to lessors are considered to be monetary assets.
These are disclosed separately from fixed assets.
Finance leases, which transfer to easyJet substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, are recognised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased property, or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Any directly attributable costs of entering into financing sale and leasebacks are included in the value of the asset recognised.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated as described below.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and the reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are included in interest and other finance charges.
68 Annual report and accounts 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Aircraft maintenance provisions The accounting for the cost of providing major airframe and certain engine maintenance checks for owned aircraft is described in the accounting policy for property, plant and equipment.
Where easyJet has a commitment to maintain aircraft held under operating leases, provision is made during the lease term for the rectification obligations contained within lease agreements.
The provisions are based on estimated future costs of major airframe, certain engine maintenance checks and one-off costs incurred at the end of lease by making appropriate charges to the income statement calculated by reference to the number of hours or cycles operated during the year.
Property, plant and equipment Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation, except for the Boeing 737-300s for which the fair value at 1 October 2004 was deemed to be their cost as allowed under IFRS 1.
Fair value was determined as market price less costs to sell.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets, on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives to the Group.
Expected useful economic lives are reviewed annually.
During the year ended 30 September 2006, the Group revised the period over which it depreciates Airbus A319 aircraft.
Aircraft that the Group holds are expected to have an operational life of 20 to 30 years.
Prior to 30 September 2006 the Group depreciated its aircraft over seven years, which was the period that it expected to hold those assets for.
The Group now holds aircraft over any period of up to the end of their operational life as deemed appropriate.
Therefore the assets are depreciated to their residual value over a period of 23 years, which is estimated to be the operational life of an Airbus A319.
Previously, the Group expected to hold aircraft for a period of approximately seven years before selling them.
This change in estimate of useful economic life did not have a material impact on depreciation in the year ended 30 September 2006, and is not expected to have a material impact going forwards.
Period of depreciation Boeing 737-300 aircraft Seven years aircraft only held in year ended 30 September 2005 Airbus A319 aircraft 23 years Aircraft improvements Three to seven years Aircraft prepaid maintenance Three to ten years Aircraft spares Ten years from date of purchase Leasehold improvements Five years or the length of lease Fixtures, fittings and equipment Three years or length of lease of property where equipment is used Computer hardware Three years Residual values, where applicable, are reviewed annually against prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date for equivalently aged assets and depreciation rates adjusted accordingly on a prospective basis.
The carrying value is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An element of the cost of a new aircraft is attributed on acquisition to prepaid maintenance and is amortised over a period ranging from three to ten years from the date of manufacture.
Subsequent costs incurred which lend enhancement to future periods such as long-term scheduled maintenance and major overhaul of aircraft and engines are capitalised and amortised over the length of period benefiting from these enhancements.
All other costs relating to maintenance are charged to the income statement as incurred.
The cost of new Airbus aircraft comprises the invoiced price of the aircraft from the supplier less the estimated value of other assets received by easyJet for no consideration in connection with the transaction to purchase 120 Airbus aircraft.
Principal assets received for no consideration in connection with the acquisition of these aircraft include the following: Cash The cash received is recognised as an asset in the balance sheet.
The corresponding credits are treated as a discount and are spread equally across each of the 120 Airbus aircraft to be delivered.
Aircraft spares These are capitalised in the balance sheet at their list price and are then depreciated according to easyJets stated accounting policies for spares.
The corresponding credits are then spread equally across the cost of each of the 120 Airbus aircraft to be delivered.
Advance payments and option payments made in respect of aircraft purchase commitments and options to acquire aircraft where the balance is expected to be funded by mortgage financing are recorded at cost.
On acquisition of the related aircraft, these payments are included as part of the cost of aircraft and are depreciated from that date.
Where the balance of payment is expected to be funded by lease financing, the advance payments are classified as deposits.
Annual report and accounts 2006 69 plc Low cost with care convenience Notes continued forming part of the financial statements 1 Accounting policies continued Goodwill Where the cost of a business acquisition exceeds the fair values attributable to the separable net assets acquired, the resulting goodwill is capitalised.
Goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is tested for impairment annually or where indicators imply that the carrying value is not recoverable.
Other intangible assets Computer software is carried at cost less accumulated amortisation.
It is amortised on a straight-line basis over its useful economic life of three years.
Computer software is all purchased outside the Group, with no internal costs capitalised.
Impairment of assets Assets that are subject to depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the higher of the assets fair value less cost to sell and its value in use.
Employee expenses easyJet contributes to defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
The assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in independently administered funds.
Group contributions are charged to the consolidated income statement in the year in which they are incurred.
The expected cost of compensated holidays is recognised at the time that the related service is provided.
Taxation including deferred tax The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for income that is exempt and expenses that are not deductible using taxation rates that are applicable to the taxable income.
Deferred taxation is recognised in profit or loss except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred taxation is provided in full on temporary differences relating to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, where it is probable that the recovery or settlement will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, taxation in the future.
Deferred taxation is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which recovery of assets and settlement of liabilities are expected to take place, based on tax rates or laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation assets represent amounts recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, losses and taxation credits carried forwards.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be suitable taxable profits from which they can be deducted.
Deferred taxation liabilities represent the amount of income taxes payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred taxation liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences, unless specifically exempt.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither taxable income nor accounting profit.
Deferred taxation arising on investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, is not recognised where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally-enforceable right to set off current taxation assets against current taxation liabilities and it is the intention to settle these on a net basis.
Share-based payments easyJet has equity-settled share-based payment compensation plans.
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is measured at the date of grant using the Binomial Lattice option pricing model.
The fair value of the estimate of the number of options that are expected to vest is expensed on a straight-line basis over the period that employees services are rendered.
When it becomes reasonably certain that performance criteria attached to the share options will not be met, the cumulative expense previously recognised for those options is reversed.
In accordance with the transition provisions of IFRS 1, easyJet has not applied this fair value calculation to share option grants that were made before 7 November 2002, but which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The cost of shares that are held by employee benefit trusts, and that are not allocated to specific grants of shares to employees, is deducted from equity.
Segmental disclosures The Group has only one business segment: the provision of a low-cost airline service within Europe.
The Group has only one geographical segment relating to the origin of its turnover which is Europe.
70 Annual report and accounts 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Investments in subsidiaries Investments in subsidiaries and associates that are not classified as held for sale are stated at cost in the entity financial statements.
Assets held for resale Where assets are available for sale in their current condition, and their disposal is highly probable, they are reclassified as held for resale.
Assets held for resale are measured at the lower of their carrying value and the fair value less costs to sell.
Depreciation on assets held for resale ceases at the point of their reclassification from fixed assets.
IFRS transitional arrangements easyJet has applied the optional transitional exemptions under IFRS 1 in the preparation of these financial statements as follows: 1 Business combinations prior to 1 October 2004 have not been restated in accordance with IFRS 3, Business Combinations.
2 Cumulative translation differences arising on consolidation of companies qualifying as foreign operations under IAS 21, The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, have been designated to be nil at 1 October 2004.
3 IFRS 2, Share-based Payments, has been applied only to equity instruments that were granted after 7 November 2002, and which had not vested before 1 January 2005.
4 IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement has been adopted from 1 October 2005 and comparative information for the impact of these standards has not been restated.
5 The fair value of certain items of property plant and equipment has been taken as their deemed cost at 1 October 2004.
New standards and interpretations not applied During the year ended September 30, 2006, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for easyJet of accounting periods beginning on or after 1 October 2006, the start date of the first financial year subsequent to these financial statements.

On implementation of IAS 39 on 1 October 2005 note 28, a time value asset of 5.0 million was recognised before the impact of deferred taxes.
For the financial year 2006, this refers to  LLP.
For the financial year 2005 this refers to KPMG Audit PLC who were auditors of the Group for that financial year.
Remuneration disclosed below as other parties entitled to act as registered auditors comprises amounts paid to Deloitte & Touche, BDO Stoy Hayward, Moore Stephens, Grant Thornton, Peters Elworthy and Moore and Bentley Jennison.

As a result the net deferred tax liability is 31.7 million 2005: 22.2 million, which comprises a deferred tax liability of 32.0 million offset by a deferred tax asset of 0.3 million.
No deferred tax liability has been recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as no tax is expected to be payable on in the foreseeable future based on the current repatriation policy of the Group.
There are no tax losses available for use in either the current or the prior period.
6 Earnings per share Basic earnings per share has been calculated by dividing the profit for the year retained for equity shareholders by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year after adjusting for changes to the capital structure of the Group and shares held by the Group in employee share option trusts.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Companys ordinary shares during the year are considered to be dilutive potential shares.
Where share options are exercisable based on performance criteria and those performance criteria have been met during the period, those options are included in the calculation of dilutive potential shares.
The earnings per share are based on the following: 2006 2005 million million Profit for the period retained for equity shareholders 94.1 59.0 million million Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period used to calculate basic earnings per share 405.7 399.3 Weighted average number of dilutive share options used to calculate diluted earnings per share 9.7 9.6 Annual report and accounts 2006 75 plc Low cost with care convenience Notes continued forming part of the financial statements 7 Goodwill 2006 million Cost and net book value at 1 October 2005 and 30 September 2006 309.6 Goodwill arose on the purchases of TEA Basel and Go Fly.
easyJet has only one cash generating unit, which is its airline network.
Goodwill arising through business combinations all relates to this one cash generating unit.
The recoverability of goodwill has been determined based on value in use.
This has been assessed by applying cashflow projections based on three-year financial forecasts approved by the Board.
The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 11.3%.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the following assumptions: operating margin and discount rate.
Operating margins and growth rates are based on the estimated effects of planned business efficiency and operational growth, however the trading environment is subject to both regulatory and competitive pressures that can have a material effect on the operating performance of the business.
Forseeable events are unlikely to result in a change in the projections to a significant enough extent to result in the carrying value of the network failing to exceed its recoverable amount.
The discount rate reflects managements estimate of the long-term return on capital employed for the business units.
Changes in sources of funding or the cost of the funding could result in changes to discount rates used.
An increase in the discount rate by 9.5 percentage points would result in the carrying amount of assets being equal to their recoverable amount.

Further details are given in the Directors remuneration report.
i Employee share option schemes The easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme The share options granted vested in tranches of 25% of the total options at dates following the Admission of the Company to the Official List of the UK Listing Authority during 2000.
Substantially all of the employees accepted employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the first tranche of options.
It is a condition of those options granted since March 2000 that the option holders accept liability for the employers Secondary National Insurance contributions due on the exercise of the options.
An easyJet Supplemental Flotation Share Option Scheme was established in respect of both UK and Swiss employees to grant options to a number of participants.
The easyJet Non-Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme 2000 Awards were made in December 2001, March 2003, January 2004, December 2004 to all eligible easyJet employees, in June 2005 to two employees and in December 2005 to one employee.
The options granted are subject to a three-year vesting period and will be exercisable subject to performance criteria.
An initial award of options over ordinary shares in easyJet plc was granted in December 2000 to eligible employees of FLS easyTech Limited easyTech, a 25% associate of easyJet Airline Company Limited with a three-year vesting period and no performance criteria.
This grant was a catch-up, as it had not been possible to grant options to these employees under the easyJet Key Employee Pre-Flotation Share Option Scheme.
The easyJet Approved Discretionary Share Option Scheme Awards were made in December 2001, March 2003, January 2004, December 2004, June 2005 and December 2005 to eligible employees of the Group on terms that meet Inland Revenue requirements for an approved share option scheme.
ii Sharesave scheme This scheme is open to all UK resident employees.
Participants may elect to save up to 250 per month under a three-year savings contract.
An option is granted by the Company to buy shares at a price based on the market price of the shares at the time of the grant.
The option price is capped at 20% of the market price of the Companys shares at the date of grant.
At the end of the savings period, a tax-free bonus is applied to the savings and the option becomes exercisable for a period of six months.
The Company made grants under the Sharesave scheme in June 2005 and June 2006, with options being granted at a discount of 20% to the market price at the time of the grant.
For those employees who are not employed by UK Group companies, similar terms and conditions apply to the UK scheme, albeit without the UK tax benefits.
iii Share incentive plan The scheme is open to all employees.
Employees can allocate part of their pre-tax salary up to a maximum of 1,500 per annum, to purchase shares in easyJet through a partnership scheme without paying National Insurance contributions or income tax.
For every share purchased through the partnership scheme, easyJet purchases a matching share.
Employees must remain in employment with easyJet three years from the date of purchase of the first share in order to qualify for the second matching share, and for five years for the partnership shares to be transferred to them tax free.
The employee retains rights over both their own shares and the matching shares, receives dividends and is able to vote at meetings once the shares are purchased.
In October 2006, the Company has granted free shares to all employees at 1 August 2006 under this scheme.
The value of shares allocated to each employee was equal to two weeks salary, with a minimum award of 600 and a maximum of 3,000.
These shares are not included in the table below as the free shares had not been allocated at 30 September 2006. iv Long-term Incentive Plan The Long-term Incentive Plan LTIP is open, by invitation, to the Airline Management Board and Senior Management Group SMG.
The LTIP has been structured to provide for regular annual awards of a performance shares worth up to 100% of salary each year up to 50% for SMG and b matching shares linked to the investment of up to 50% of annual bonus in easyJet shares, which are then matched on a 1:1 gross basis.
The vesting of all regular annual LTIP awards is dependent on return on equity targets being achieved.
These targets are measured by a reference to a three-year performance period commencing in the financial year that the grant is made.
In addition the LTIP provides for a one-off FTSE 100 award to senior executives.
This award is structured so that, if easyJet becomes a member of the FTSE 100 index for a period of at least six months before the end of the financial year ending 30 September 2008, participants will receive easyJet shares worth up to 100% of salary.
Grants were made under the LTIP in December 2005.

50% of this matching share award vests three years after grant subject to performance conditions relating to the growth in the normalised EPS over the three years.
The other 50% of this matching award vests three years after grant subject to the same ROE targets as the LTIP.
The grant was made in December 2005.

It is anticipated that shares to settle the share incentive plan, the long-term incentive plan and the Chief Executive matching award will be purchased in the market rather than issued as new shares.
The estimated fair values of share options are calculated by applying a binomial option pricing model.
The assumptions used in the model are as follows: ShareShare Long-termChief Executive options incentive plan Sharesave Incentive Plan matching Share price, 1.81 3.80 2.80 4.51 2.45 3.66 3.42 3.76 Exercise price, 1.84 3.60 0.00 1.86 2.61 0.00 0.00 Expected volatility 40 42% n a 42% n a n a Option life, years 6.5 n a 3.5 n a n a Expected dividend yield 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Risk-free interest rate 4.15 4.62% n a 4.09 4.68% n a n a Share price is the closing share price on the date of grant of each tranche of options.
Exercise price is determined by the terms of each option plan, as discussed above.
Differences between share price and exercise price are because of the use of a five-day weighted average price to determine option price.
In addition for the Sharesave scheme, a 20% discount is given between option price and share price.
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages.
The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans was 4.2 million 2005: 2.0 million, all of which related to equity settled share-based payment transactions.
84 Annual report and accounts 2006 20 Share-based payments continued The following shares were held by the Groups Employee Share Trusts as at 30 September in order to satisfy share-based payment schemes.

The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in fair value of cash flow hedging instruments relating to hedge transactions that are extant at 30 September 2006.
The foreign currency translation reserve contains the accumulated foreign exchange differences from the translation of the financial statements of the Groups foreign operations with a non-sterling functional currency, arising when the this entity is consolidated.
Cash proceeds from share options exercised totalled 17.9 million, representing amounts received from third parties.
18.8 million was received from Group subsidiaries on exercise of share options by third parties.

These were: A hedge of certain shortto medium-term foreign currency operational payments by forward exchange contracts and collars hedging future foreign exchange risk.
A hedge of future jet fuel purchases by forward jet derivative contracts hedging future fuel price risk.
To the extent that these hedges were assessed as highly effective, a summary of the amounts included in equity and the periods in which the related cash flows are expected to occur are summarised below.

Group policy seeks to minimise the impact of translation adjustments as a result of the monthly revaluation of US dollar denominated liabilities.
This is achieved through drawing down loans in sterling, holding some US dollar cash and the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been entered into to purchase $562.0 million at future dates.
These mature within one year.
Hedge accounting is not sought for these derivatives as they are used to manage exposures arising from the Groups net US dollar financial liabilities which totalled $566.7 million at 30 September 2006.
Transaction Group policy is to hedge a percentage of US dollar expenditure in order to reduce the impact of adverse foreign currency movements on the profit and loss account.
This is managed using both forward foreign exchange contracts and zero cost collars.
The amounts hedged are based on a percentage of the forecast US dollar expenditure.
Foreign currency zero cost collars have been entered into to purchase $1,031.0 million at future dates.
Forward foreign currency contracts have been entered into to purchase $28.0 million at future dates.
Hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives as they hedge future payments for jet fuel, aircraft leases and aircraft leased maintenance reserves.
Amounts recorded in the income statement relating to foreign exchange gains and losses, and the derivative financial instruments entered into to manage this foreign exchange risk were as follows: million Unrealised revaluation gains losses included in operating profit 8.4 Realised foreign exchange losses included in operating profit 2.2 Realised gains losses on derivatives held for trading 0.5 Net foreign exchange gains and losses in operating profit 6.7 Unrealised revaluation gains losses included in operating profit 9.3 Unrealised fair value movements on derivatives held for trading 0.4 Realised gains losses on derivatives held for trading 10.3 Net foreign exchange gains and losses in financing costs note 4 1.4 Net foreign exchange gains and losses in income statement 5.3 Jet fuel price risk Group policy is to hedge a percentage of anticipated jet fuel expenditure in order to reduce the impact of adverse fuel price movements on the profit and loss account.
This is managed using both forward foreign transactions and zero cost collars.
The amounts hedged are based on a percentage of the forecast jet fuel requirement.
Jet fuel zero cost collars have been entered into to protect the price volatility of 321,000 metric tonnes of fuel.
Forward contracts have been entered into to fix the price of 154,250 metric tonnes of fuel.
Hedge accounting is applied to these derivatives as they hedge future payments of jet fuel.
Financing and interest rate risk In order to provide flexibility the Group seeks to have a mix of both owned and leased aircraft.
The Group has a target policy for the interest exposure on operating leases of 50 50.
Bank loans are all at floating rate and the finance leases put in place during the year are predominantly floating rate.
The effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2006 Bank borrowings 6.28% Finance lease borrowings 5.60% Bank borrowings are all variable rate and bear interest by reference to US dollar LIBOR or sterling LIBOR plus a margin The Group is also exposed to interest rate risk as operating lease rentals for the lease of aircraft are based on fixed or variable interest rate terms.
88 Annual report and accounts 2006 23 Financial instruments continued Credit risk The maximum credit risk exposure of the Groups financial assets at 30 September 2006 is represented by the amounts reported under the corresponding balance sheet headings.
The Group considers that it is not exposed to major concentrations of credit risk: the majority of the Groups trade debtors are represented by amounts due from a few well established credit card acquirers, and cash balances are held with several major banks and rated money market funds.
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments, but does not expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group limits the amount of credit exposure to any one counterparty.
Currently the Group makes use of standard International Swaps and Derivative Associate ISDA documentation.
Fair value of non-derivative financial instruments The carrying value of financial assets is approximate or equal to their fair value.
The carrying value of short-term borrowings approximates fair value.
All bank loans are based on variable interest rates and therefore their carrying value approximates their fair value.
Finance lease borrowings are based partly on variable interest rates, and partly on fixed interest rates.
The book value of finance leases totals 102.6 million whereas the fair value, calculated on a discounted cash flow basis, totals 96.4 million.
Where market values are not available, fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates and by applying year-end exchange rates.
b UK GAAP disclosures The following disclosures are included at 30 September 2005 to meet the requirements of Financial Reporting Standard 13, Derivatives and Other Financial Instruments: Disclosure.
The objectives, policies and strategies applied by the Group with respect to financial instruments are determined at a Group level.
The principal financial instruments used by the Group to finance its operations are cash and loans.
The significant financial risks faced by the Group and the policies that it applies are considered below.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
During the year ended 30 September 2005, the Group used a limited range of derivative financial instruments and forward contracts to hedge its exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
The Group has not used any financial instruments to hedge its exposure to other foreign currencies and interest rate fluctuations, although natural hedges limit the exposures to these risks.
The primary hedging approach implemented has been to limit exposure to significant adverse movements in US dollar exchange rates and Jet A1 fuel costs using a range of option products.
In addition, forward contracts for jet fuel requirements were used in the second half of the reporting period.
The level of hedging cover taken during the year has been up to 80% of projected cash flows for US dollar and up to 80% for Jet A1 fuel on a one-year horizon, and to hedge a smaller percentage of estimated expense up to 36 months in advance.
At 30 September 2005, the hedging in place included a range of options on US dollar sterling and Jet A1 fuel.
Foreign currency risk The Group has an international business.
Its reporting and principal trading currency is sterling.
Aircraft purchases, sales and leasing transactions together with other aircraft-related costs are denominated predominantly in US dollars.
The Group also operates, to a lesser extent, in a number of other currencies.
The Groups trade activity is concentrated in Europe, where there is a matching, to some extent, of the cash inflows and outflows of different European currencies.
The majority of the Groups trading revenue is derived in sterling, although a significant amount of revenue is also derived in other European currencies and, other than fuel, insurance, aircraft leases, interest expense on external borrowings and some maintenance costs, the Groups cost base has a similar profile.
Fuel, insurance, aircraft leases, some interest expense on external borrowings and some maintenance costs are payable in US dollars and movements in the value of the US dollar against sterling impact these costs to the Group: a strong sterling against the US dollar reduces these costs to the Group.
30% of the total Group costs in the year ended 30 September 2005 were incurred by easyJet in US dollars.
There were minimal US dollar revenues.
Annual report and accounts 2006 89 plc Low cost with care convenience Notes continued forming part of the financial statements 23 Financial instruments continued 137.8 million or $243.7 million of the Groups total liabilities at 30 September 2005 were denominated in US dollars, with the effect that the Groups profits can be significantly affected by movements in the rate of sterling against the US dollar.
Under UK GAAP, approximately 27% of the Groups total assets were denominated in US dollars.
This change occurred due to the adoption of IAS 21 note 28.
Under UK GAAP, owned aircraft, and deposits paid towards the funding of aircraft were denominated in US dollars, whereas under IAS 21, these items are considered to be sterling denominated.
Under UK GAAP, The Group mitigated the effect of such movements in the value of the US dollar denominated assets by borrowing in the same currencies as those US dollar denominated assets.
Under UK GAAP, owned aircraft were anticipated to be sold for US dollars within approximately seven years of their acquisition.
The resulting sale proceeds were expected to be used largely to pay down US dollar loans and as a result these large US dollar inflows were not considered to create a significant currency exposure to the Group.
The US dollar sterling exchange rate at 30 September 2005 was 1.769.
3% of the total Group costs in the year ended 30 September 2005 were incurred by easyJet Switzerland, whose functional currency is the Swiss Franc.
The costs of that business are translated into sterling at average exchange rates for the purposes of inclusion into the consolidated income statement, and the net assets at the year-end exchange rate of the Swiss Franc against sterling.
To a large extent, the exposure to the Swiss Franc is mitigated as revenue in that currency is also earned by the Group.
The table below summarises the Groups exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the income statement.
Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and liabilities of the Group that are not denominated in the functional currency of the operation to which they relate.

This target is to be achieved as leases on the new Airbus planes are implemented and the 16 remaining fixed rate leases acquired with Go Fly expire.
The fixed and floating rate interest profile for leases at 30 September 2005 was 68% 32% for the Airbus aircraft and 59% 41% for the entire fleet.
There is no such formal policy on bank loans, which are all at floating rates.
The Groups historical borrowings are analysed below between fixed rate and variable rate loans.

The variable rate bank loans bear interest by reference to US dollar LIBOR or sterling LIBOR plus a margin.
The loans are repayable in quarterly and six monthly instalments.
The majority of the Groups financial assets comprise bank balances, which attract interest at the applicable money market deposit rates.
At 30 September 2005, all of the Groups cash and liquid resources had a maturity of 180 days or less and attracted a weighted average rate of 4.3%.

Credit risk Potential concentrations comprise principally cash, trade debtors and hedging relationships.
The majority of the Groups trade debtors are represented by amounts due from a few well established credit card acquirers.
The cash balances are held with several major banks and rated money market funds.
The credit ratings for the credit card acquirers, banks and money market funds do not suggest there to be significant exposure as a result of these concentrations.
The hedging amounts due arise with major financial counterparties with credit ratings of A or better.
Funding risk The most significant investment activity undertaken by the Group historically has been the acquisition of aircraft.
To a large extent, the Group sells and leases back the aircraft to manage its funding risks.
The Group also owns aircraft which have been financed by asset-backed bank loans.
In March 2003, the Group agreed to purchase 120 new Airbus A319 aircraft for delivery over the next five years.
At 30 September 2005, the Group had taken delivery of 55 Airbus aircraft and has plans to take delivery of a further 32 in the coming year.
As a result of the order and expected deliveries, the Group continues to make significant deposits on aircraft.
At the same time it is recovering deposits paid previously as delivery is taken of aircraft.
As the Group has large cash resources to meet these payments and financing is arranged for the aircraft prior to delivery, no significant funding risk is perceived.
Fair values of financial assets and liabilities A comparison by category of book value and fair value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities is provided in the table below.
30 September 2005 Book value Fair value million million Primary financial instruments held to finance the Groups operations: Fuel hedges 10.3 Currency hedges 10.2 Bank loans 217.3 217.3 Cash 695.5 695.5 478.2 498.7 As described above, in the current year the Group used options to hedge its future exposure to US dollar rates and Jet A1 fuel costs.
Changes in the fair value of these instruments are not recognised in the financial statements until the hedged positions mature.
The variable rate interest terms on the bank loans are agreed on an arms-length basis and therefore, the fair value of those loans approximate to their book values.
The fair value of the bank loans that are subject to fixed rate interest terms is not considered to be materially different from their book value on the basis that the period over which the interest terms are fixed is relatively short and that the fixed interest terms are agreed on an arms-length basis.
The fair value of cash approximates to its book value in most cases due to its immediate availability.
For cash that is subject to restrictions, the cash attracts variable rate interest, and therefore the fair value approximates to its book value.
Annual report and accounts 2006 91 plc Low cost with care convenience Notes continued forming part of the financial statements 23 Financial instruments continued In respect of the US dollar exchange rate, at 30 September 2005 the Group had currency hedges through options and forwards of $1.1 billion, $747 million of which will expire before 30 September 2006.
At 30 September 2005, the total value of these instruments was a gain of 10.2 million.
In respect of fuel, the Group had hedges for 206,000 tonnes of fuel through options at 30 September 2005.
These all expired before 30 September 2006.
At 30 September 2005, the total value of these instruments was a gain of 10.3 million.
There were no further hedges outstanding at 30 September 2005.
Gains and losses on instruments used for hedging are not recognised until the exposure that is being hedged is itself recognised.
Unrecognised gains and losses on financial instruments are as follows: Net gains Gains Losses losses million million million At 1 October 2004 13.7 1.0 12.7 Losses arising before 1 October 2004 that were recognised during the year 13.7 1.0 12.7 Gains losses arising in the year that were not recognised during the year 20.5 20.5 Gains losses at 30 September 2005 20.5 20.5 Of which: Gains losses expected to be recognised in less than one year 17.8 17.8 Gains losses expected to be recognised after more than one year 2.7 2.7 Gains losses at 30 September 2005 20.5 20.5 24 Commitments a Commitments under operating leases Aircraft 2006 2005 million million Total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases due: Within one year 117.1 128.6 Greater than one and less than five years 387.8 393.9 After five years 134.9 160.7 639.8 683.2 Land and buildings 2006 2005 million million Total commitments under non-cancellable operating leases due: Within one year 2.2 2.7 Greater than one and less than five years 4.2 5.1 After five years 5.1 5.6 11.5 13.4 92 Annual report and accounts 2006 24 Commitments continued b Minimum lease payments under finance leases fall due as follows: 2006 2005 million million Not later than one year 7.8 Later than one year but not more than five years 31.5 More than five years 104.8 144.1 Future finance charges on finance leases 41.5 Present value of finance lease liabilities 102.6 c Other financial commitments As a result of a purchase agreement approved by shareholders in March 2003, the Group is contractually committed to the acquisition of a further 53 new Airbus A319 aircraft with a list price of approximately US $2.3 billion, being approximately 1.3 billion before escalations, discounts and deposit payments already made.
In respect of those aircraft, deposit payments amounting to $164.3 million or 90.9 million 2005: $262.0 million or 145.5 million had been made as at 30 September 2005, for commitments for the acquisition of Airbus A319 aircraft.
25 Contingent liabilities The Group is involved in various disputes or litigation in the normal course of business.
Whilst the result of such disputes cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the ultimate resolution of these disputes will not have a material affect on the Groups financial position or results.
26 Related party transactions The Group has transacted with The Big Orange Handling Company Limited, of which easyJet Airline Company Limited, a Group company, owns 26% of the equity.
easyJet Airline Company Limited, a Group company, signed an agreement with Eilon & Associates Limited, a company controlled by Amir Eilon, who served as a Non-Executive Director of easyJet plc until February 2006.
The contract is to provide consulting services to easyJet in respect of a specific business development project.
Payment for services is based on a daily rate of 1,500 or 2,000.
Total remuneration paid during the year was nil 2005: 85,643.
The charges are summarised below for the years ended 30 September 2006 and 2005, together with the balances outstanding at those dates.
The Big Orange Handling Company Limited Eilon & Associates Limited 2006 2005 2006 2005 million million million million Charges to the Group 8.4 8.5 0.1 Charges by the Group 1.5 1.3 Year-end debtor creditor 0.3 0.2 In the course of business the Group has also transacted with companies of which Stelios Haji-Ioannou is the majority shareholder: easyBus Limited and easyGroup IP Limited.
Stelios Haji-Ioannou is a Non-Executive Director of easyJet plc and was formerly the Chairman of the Group.
The transactions principally relate to the charging of advertising costs and web page click-through revenues between the Group and these companies.
The amounts charged to the Group, charged by the Group and the year-end balance position with these companies is less than 0.1 million therefore they are not included in the table above.
27 Post balance sheet events On 13 November 2006, easyJet agreed that, subject to shareholder approval, it had converted a further 52 of its Airbus option aircraft to firm deliveries in 2008, 2009 and 2010: furthermore an additional 75 purchase rights had been obtained for aircraft which could be delivered during the period to 2015.
Annual report and accounts 2006 93 plc Low cost with care convenience Notes continued forming part of the financial statements 28 Transition to IFRS For all periods up to and including 30 September 2005, easyJet prepared its financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
These financial statements are the first that the Group is required to prepare under IFRS.
In preparing financial statements under IFRS, easyJet has started from an opening balance sheet as at 1 October 2004, easyJets transition date, and made changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the adjustments made in restating easyJets UK GAAP balance sheet at the transition date and its previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2005.
There were no material adjustments to the Group cash flow statement as a result of adoption of IFRS.
The exemptions applied on transition are included in note 1, accounting policies.
a Presentation adjustments The financial information is in IFRS format, and reflects a number of differences in presentation between UK GAAP and IFRS as follows: i The disclosure of goodwill as separate from other intangible assets on the balance sheet: ii The classification of software that is not an integral part of operating hardware as another intangible asset separate from property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet, and the classification of the related depreciation as amortisation: iii The classification of long-term assets previously included in current assets: iv The reclassification of cash on deposit with a maturity of greater than one year or between three months and one year, previously classified as liquid resources in the cash flow statement, as a long-term or current financial asset: v The separate classification of a Boeing 737-300 which was held for resale at 30 September 2005: vi The reclassification of provisions as current or non-current liabilities: vii The reclassification of foreign exchange reserves arising on the retranslation of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than sterling from retained earnings to other reserves: and viii The format of the income statement will be substantially similar to that of the results of operations included in the operating and financial review in the Groups previous UK GAAP financial statements.
The Companies Act Schedule 4 format of the profit and loss account is no longer required to be used under IFRS and use of this alternative format is more relevant to how the business is managed: b IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates, and IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of IFRS Under UK GAAP, certain US dollar denominated assets and liabilities are treated as a foreign operation branch with the US dollar as their functional currency.
As a result, exchange movements on retranslation of assets and liabilities are taken to reserves rather than through the income statement.
IAS 21 provides additional criteria to allow the functional currency of a foreign operation to be determined.
Certain aircraft-owning companies within the Group will cease to be classified as US dollar branches under IAS 21, and will have a sterling functional currency.
On implementing IAS 21, non-monetary assets have been restated at historic exchange rates, with no translation differences arising subsequent to their purchase.
Exchange differences on retranslation of monetary items are taken to the income statement.
This has resulted in an additional 2.6 million loss being recognised during the year to 30 September 2005.
The net book value of the airbus fixed assets was restated to remove the impact of historic foreign exchange differences recognised on retranslation of the US dollar denominated assets into sterling under UK GAAP.
Depreciation has also been restated to take into account the new cost base of the aircraft fixed assets.
This resulted in an increase in the net book value of fixed assets of 11.1 million at 1 October 2004.
As a result of these changes to the cost of Airbus aircraft fixed assets, depreciation increased by 1.1 million in the year ended 30 September 2005.
Under the exemptions allowed by IFRS 1, the fair value at 1 October 2004 of the Boeing 737-300 aircraft has been taken as their deemed cost.
This has resulted in a one-off valuation decrease in property, plant and equipment of 3.7 million at 1 October 2004, a decrease in accelerated depreciation of 2.7 million and a decrease in depreciation of 0.9 million for the year to 30 September 2005, and an increase in the loss on disposal of fixed assets of 0.4 million for the year to 30 September 2005.
One of the aircraft was held for sale at 30 September, 2005, and as a result of its revaluation assets held for resale decreased by 0.2 million at 30 September 2005.
Certain payments on account made prior to delivery of aircraft are monetary assets, as the aircraft that will be delivered as a result of these payments are expected to be sold to lessors and leased back under operating leases on the basis of commercial arrangements in place.
These pre-delivery deposits have been classified separately on the balance sheet, resulting in a decrease in the book value of fixed assets of 83.0 million on transition.
Adoption of IAS 21 may cause additional volatility in the income statement due to changes in foreign exchange rates.
This risk will be managed through a mixture of drawing down loans in sterling, holding cash and cash equivalents in US dollars and entering into foreign exchange derivative instruments.
94 Annual report and accounts 2006 28 Transition to IFRS continued c IFRS 2 Share-based Payment IFRS 2 requires a charge to be made to the income statement for the cost of providing share options to employees.
The expense is calculated as the fair value of the award on the date of grant, and is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme.
A binomial model has been used to calculate the fair value of options on their grant date.
easyJet has applied the provisions of IFRS 2 only to awards made after 7 November 2002, an exemption allowed on transition by IFRS 1.
There was no net impact on the balance sheet at 1 October 2004 as a result of adopting IFRS 2.
In the year to 30 September 2005, the application of IFRS 2 results in a pre-tax charge to the income statement of 2.0 million.
d IFRS 3 Business Combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill arising on business combinations is amortised over a period not exceeding 20 years.
Under IFRS 3, regular amortisation of goodwill is prohibited.
Instead, an annual impairment test is required to support the carrying value of goodwill.
Amortisation of goodwill arising on the purchase of TEA Basel AG now easyJet Switzerland and Newgo 1 Limited, the parent company of Go Fly ceased on 1 October 2004, resulting in an increase of pre-tax profits of 17.4 million in the year ended 30 September 2005. e IAS 19 Employee Benefits Under UK GAAP, no provision is made for annual leave accrued.
Under IAS 19, the expected cost of compensated short-term absences should be recognised at the time the related service is provided.
As a result, on transition, a provision of 0.4 million has been recognised.
The result on pre-tax income for the year ended 30 September 2005 is an additional expense of 0.1 million.
f IAS 12 Income Taxes Under UK GAAP, deferred tax was provided on timing differences that had originated, but had not reversed, before the balance sheet date.
Under IAS 12, deferred tax is provided on temporary differences based upon the future recovery or settlement of assets and liabilities recognised in the balance sheet.
As a result of accounting policy changes resulting from the implementation of IFRS, and the implementation of IAS 12, a total additional deferred tax liability of 4.3 million has been provided on transition, and the tax expense under IFRS has been reduced by 1.6 million in the year to 30 September 2005 by comparison to UK GAAP.
These changes are as a result of the following items: As a result of changes in asset values as described in 4b above, a deferred tax liability of 4.7 million was recognised on transition.
The deferred tax charge for the year ended 30 September 2005 was reduced by 1.3 million: No deferred tax on share options was recognised on transition as the market value of an easyJet share on 30 September 2004 was 1.27, less than the exercise price of all the options which were issued after 7 November 2002 and which are accounted for under IFRS 2 4c above.
A deferred tax asset of 0.3 million has been recognised on transition in respect of share options issued prior to 7 November 2002.
At 30 September 2005, a deferred tax asset of 8.2 million was recognised on all options.
This caused a 7.9 million increase in equity, a 0.6 million reduction in the deferred tax charge and a 0.3 million increase in the current tax charge in the income statement.
The increase in the deferred tax asset partly reflects the increase in the share price at 30 September 2005 to 2.92, above the exercise price for the majority of the options in issue on that date: and Other adjustments as a result of accounting policy changes resulted in the recognition of an additional deferred tax asset of 0.1 million on transition, and no additional expense arose in the year ended 30 September 2005. g IAS 28 Investments in Associates Associated undertakings are equity accounted for under both IAS 28 and UK GAAP.
The only difference between the treatment of associates under IFRS compared to UK GAAP is the disclosures in the income statement.
easyJets share of the post-tax profits of its associate are shown on a single line in the income statement under IFRS, whereas under UK GAAP easyJets share of the pre-tax profits of its associate were separately disclosed, with the associates tax charge included in the Groups tax charge.

At 1 October 2005, easyJet has met the criteria to adopt hedge accounting for foreign exchange and fuel derivative instruments.
These instruments comprise forwards and zero cost collars.
As a result of applying hedge accounting, at 1 October 2005 the fair value of the financial instruments has been recognised as a financial asset on the balance sheet, with the intrinsic value of the instruments at that date being recognised in reserves, and the time value portion being an adjustment to retained earnings.
