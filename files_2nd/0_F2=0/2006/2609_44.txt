28 Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise cash and short term deposits, external borrowings, redeemable preference shares, deferred consideration, as well as trade debtors and creditors, arising directly from operations.
The Groups activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risks including currency risk, fair value interest risk and price risk, credit risk, liquidity risk and cash flow interest rate risk.
Risk management is carried out by a central treasury department Group treasury.
The Group treasury department seeks to reduce financial risk and to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs and to invest in cash assets safely and profitably.
This is done in close co-operation with the Groups operating units.
The Group treasury department does not operate as a profit centre and transacts only in relation to the underlying business requirements.
The policies of Group treasury are reviewed and approved by the Board of directors.
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
i Market Risk Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures.
Burberry Group monitors the desirability of hedging the profits and the net assets of the overseas subsidiaries when translated in to Sterling for reporting purposes.
It has not entered into any specific transactions for this purpose.
Burberry Groups income statement is affected by transactions denominated in foreign currency.
To reduce exposure to currency fluctuations, Burberry Group has a policy of hedging foreign currency denominated transactions by entering into forward exchange contracts see note 26.
The Groups accounting policy in relation to derivative instruments are set out in note 2.
Price Risk The Groups exposure to equity securities price risk is minimal.
The Group is not exposed to commodity price risk.
ii Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
In addition, receivables balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result that the Groups exposure to bad debts is not significant.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets, which comprise cash and short term deposits and certain derivative instruments, the Groups exposure to credit risk arises from the default of the counter party with a maximum exposure equal to the carrying value of these instruments.
The Group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any financial institution.
Burberry Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 75 NOTES TO THE GROUP FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 28 Financial risk management continued iii Liquidity Risk The Group financial risk management policy aims to ensure that sufficient cash is maintained to meet foreseeable needs and close out market positions.
Due to the dynamic nature of the underlying business, the Group treasury aims to maintain flexibility in funding by keeping committed credit lines available.
For further details of this, see note 27. iv Cash flow interest rate risk The Groups exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates, relates primarily to cash, short term deposits and external borrowings.
The external borrowings are linked to the LIBOR rate, while cash and short term borrowings are affected by local market rates around the Group.
The borrowings at variable rates exposes the Group to cashflow interest rate risk.
Currently, this risk is not hedged as the risk is not considered significant.
This situation is monitored by the Group treasury department.
