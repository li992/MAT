Notes to the consolidated financial statements year ended 30 April 2006 1 Accounting policies Basis of preparation These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.
The Group has elected to take the optional exemption from applying IAS 32 and IAS 39 in the comparative year and to first apply them at 1 May 2005 and for the year ended 30 April 2006.
There is no impact on the consolidated financial statements of applying IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the implementation of these standards at 1 May 2005.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Although these estimates are based on managements best knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure applicable for financial years commencing on or after 1 January 2007 was available for early application but has not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements.
The standard is concerned only with disclosure and as such, were it to have been applied in the year ending 30 April 2006, would have had no impact on the income statement or balance sheet.
The disclosures required by IFRS 1 concerning the transition from UK GAAP to IFRS are given in Note 29, along with details of the choices made by the Group in respect of the optional exemptions allowable under IFRS 1.
Group reconstruction In October 2004, the Group implemented a capital reorganisation, incorporating a Scheme of Arrangement, in order to effect the return of 12 per share to shareholders by January 2011.
In the opinion of the Directors, the Scheme of Arrangement was a group reconstruction rather than an acquisition, since the shareholders in the holding company of the Group after the implementation of the Scheme The Berkeley Group Holdings plc were the same as the shareholders in the holding company of the Group before the implementation of the Scheme The Berkeley Group plc, with no change to the rights of each shareholder, relative to the others, and no alteration to minority interests in the net assets of the Group.
Accordingly, the Directors adopted merger rather than acquisition accounting principles in drawing up the financial statements, having regard to the overriding requirement of Section 227 6 of the Companies Act 1985 for the accounts to present a true and fair view of the Groups results and financial position.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations does not identify merger accounting as applicable for business combinations: however it does not address the situation where a new holding company is added to an existing group by issuing shares in exchange for the transfer of shares in the existing group.
There is currently no guidance as to the appropriate accounting in such situations under IFRS.
The Directors therefore believe that it is appropriate to continue to adopt merger accounting for the Group reconstruction under IFRS.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the parent company and all its subsidiary undertakings.
The accounting date for subsidiary undertakings is 30 April.
In the case of acquisitions or disposals, the Groups result includes that proportion from or to the effective date of acquisition or disposal as appropriate.
Goodwill Where the cost of acquiring new and additional interests in subsidiaries, joint ventures and businesses exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired, the resulting premium on acquisition goodwill is capitalised and its subsequent measurement is based on annual impairment reviews, with any impairment losses recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to 1998 under UK GAAP was not reinstated on transition to IFRS and is not included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
Joint ventures Entities which are jointly controlled with another party or parties joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method of accounting.
The results attributable to the Companys holding in joint ventures are shown separately in the consolidated income statement.
The amount included in the consolidated balance sheet is the Groups share of the net assets of the joint ventures plus net loans receivable.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of joint ventures is accounted for in accordance with the policy set out above.
The carrying value of goodwill is included in the carrying value of the investment in joint ventures.
Revenue Revenue represents the amounts receivable from the sale of properties during the year.
Properties are treated as sold and profits are taken when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
This policy applies to both residential housebuilding and commercial property activities.
Revenue does not include the value of the onward sale of part exchange properties, for which the net gain or loss is recognised in cost of sales.
co. uk 51 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued year ended 30 April 2006 1 Accounting policies continued Expenditure Expenditure is recognised in respect of goods and services received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms.
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future liability in respect of a past event and where the amount of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Borrowing costs Interest is written off to the income statement as incurred.
Taxation The taxation expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK Corporation tax, is provided at the amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rules and laws that have been enacted, or substantively enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised on all taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill, or from the initial recognition except in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit, or from differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred taxation is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
The carrying values of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available against which taxable temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to reserves, in which case the deferred taxation is also dealt with in reserves.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost of the assets on a straight line basis to their residual value over their estimated useful lives at the following annual rates: Freehold property 2% Fixtures and fittings 15% 20% 1 Motor vehicles 25% Computer equipment 33 3% Leasehold property is amortised over the period of the lease.
Computer equipment is included within fixtures and fittings.
The assets residual values, carrying values and useful lives are reviewed on an annual basis and adjusted if appropriate at each balance sheet date.
Where an impairment is identified, the recoverable amount of the asset is identified and an impairment loss, where appropriate, is recognised in the income statement.
Inventories Property in the course of development is valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Direct cost comprises the cost of land, raw materials and development costs but excludes indirect overheads and interest.
Progress payments are deducted from work in progress.
Provision is made, where appropriate, to reduce the value of inventories and work in progress to their net realisable value.
Land purchased for development, including land in the course of development, is initially recorded at fair value.
Where such land is purchased on deferred settlement terms, and the fair value differs from the amount that will subsequently be paid in settling the liability, this difference is charged as a finance cost in the income statement over the period to settlement.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprises cash balances in hand and at the bank, including bank overdrafts repayable on demand which form part of the Groups cash management, for which offset arrangements across Group businesses have been applied where appropriate.
Trade and other payables Trade payables on normal terms are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Trade payables on extended terms are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition of the asset to which they relate.
The discount to nominal value is amortised over the period of the credit term and charged to finance costs.
co. uk 1 Accounting policies continued Derivative financial instruments From time to time the Group makes use of interest rate swaps and caps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
On 1 May 2005, the Group adopted IAS 32 and IAS 39, which had no impact on the financial statements.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at cost.
Subsequent to initial recognition these instruments are stated at fair value.
Where the derivative instrument is deemed an effective hedge over the interest rate exposure, the instrument is treated as a cash flow hedge, and hedge accounting is applied, whereby gains and losses in the fair value of the derivative instrument are recognised directly in equity until such time as the gains or losses are realised.
On realisation, any gains are reported in the income statement net of related charges.
Employee benefits a Pensions The Group accounts for pensions and similar benefits under IAS 19 Employee benefits.
The Group has also adopted early the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to equity through the statement of recognised income and expense.
Since the Group has elected to follow this approach, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to employee benefit schemes have been recognised at the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period.
For defined benefit schemes, the obligations are measured at discounted present value whilst plan assets are recorded at fair value.
The calculation of the net obligation is performed by a qualified actuary.
The operating and financing costs of these plans are recognised separately in the income statement: service costs are spread systematically over the lives of the employees and financing costs are recognised in the period in which they arise.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement of recognised income and expense SORIE.
Cumulative actuarial gains and losses were recognised at 1 May 2004, the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period, within the net obligation at that date.
Pension contributions under defined contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as incurred.
b Share-based payments The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments, in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 which had not vested as of 1 January 2005.
The fair value of awards under the Groups Long-Term Incentive Plans at the date of grant are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the awards, based on the Groups estimate of the awards that will eventually vest.
Shares held in trust to satisfy these awards are treated as a deduction from shareholders funds.
Leasing and rental agreements Payments under rental and operating lease agreements are charged against profit on a straight line basis over the life of the lease.
Accounting estimates and judgments Management apply the Groups accounting policies as described above when making critical accounting judgments, of which no individual judgment is deemed to have a significant impact upon the financial statements, apart from those involving estimations, which are detailed below.
a Carrying value of land and work in progress and estimation of costs to complete The Group holds inventories stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Such inventories include land, work in progress and completed units.
As residential development is largely speculative by nature, not all inventories are covered by forward sales contracts.
Furthermore due to the nature of the Groups activity and, in particular the scale of its developments and the length of the development cycle, the Group has to allocate site-wide development costs between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to forecast the costs to complete on such developments.
In making such assessments and allocations, there is a degree of inherent estimation uncertainty.
The Group has established internal controls designed to effectively assess and centrally review inventory carrying values and ensure the appropriateness of the estimates made.
b Pensions Pension assumptions are set out within Note 5 and are as advised by the Groups actuary.
The assumptions include expected long-term rate of return on assets and the discount rate used.
Such estimations are based on assumed rates and should these differ from what actually transpires, the pension liability of the Group would change.
co. uk 2 Segmental reporting continued All revenue and profit are derived from sales to external customers and from activities performed in the United Kingdom, which is considered a single economic environment for the Groups activities.
For this reason segment reporting is only presented by business segment.
Included in Group residential housebuilding revenue and operating profit are 1,142,000 and 889,000 2005: 16,139,000 and 6,600,000 in respect of land sales.
Unallocated income, costs, assets and liabilities relate to those areas that are managed centrally by the Group, and cannot be reasonably allocated to the business segments.
These comprise the Groups net cash debt and associated interest receivable and payable, the current tax creditor, the deferred tax asset and the tax charge, and the retirement benefit obligation.

Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of taxation services was incurred primarily in connection with corporate activity in the year.
Remuneration paid to the auditors in respect of other services relates largely to financial due diligence.
In addition to the above services, the Groups auditor acted as auditor to The Berkeley Group plc Staff Benefit Plan and The Berkeley Group Money Purchase Pension Plan.
The appointment of auditors to the Groups pension schemes and the fees paid in respect of those audits are agreed by the trustees of each scheme, who act independently of the management of the Group.
The aggregate fees paid to the Groups auditors for audit services to the pension schemes during the year were 12,000 2005: 11,000.
Operating expenses represent administration costs.

Details of Directors emoluments are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 38 to 41.
Pensions During the year the Group operated four principal pension schemes.
The Berkeley Group plc Staff Benefits Plan the Berkeley Final Salary Plan is a defined benefit scheme and was closed to new entrants from 1 May 2002.
The Berkeley Group plc Money Purchase Scheme the Berkeley Money Purchase Plan and the St George PLC Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme the St George Scheme are defined contribution schemes.
The assets of these schemes were held in separate trustee administered funds.
With effect from 1 March 2006, the St George PLC Group Personal Pension Plan a contract based defined contribution scheme was introduced to replace the St George Scheme.
Defined contribution plan Contributions amounting to 791,000 2005: 1,615,000 of which 219,000 2005: 308,000 were paid on behalf of joint ventures, and 21,000 2005: 102,000 related to discontinued operations, were paid into the defined contribution schemes during the year.
Defined benefit plan The Berkeley Final Salary Plan is subject to an independent actuarial valuation at least every three years.
The most recent valuation was carried out as at 1 May 2004.
The method adopted in the 2004 valuation was the projected unit method, which assumed a return on investment prior to and after retirement of 6.5% and 5.5% per annum respectively, pension increases for service before and after April 1997 of 3.0% and 3.7% per annum respectively and salary escalation at 4.0% per annum.
The market value of the Berkeley Final Salary Plan assets at 1 May 2004 was 18,100,000 and was sufficient to cover 72% of the schemes liabilities.
Employers contributions are currently paid at 21.1% and it is currently proposed to maintain this level of contribution thereby reducing the deficit to zero over the expected remaining service life of existing members.
The Company is currently in the process of reviewing all of its pension arrangements.
The major assumptions used by the actuary were: 30 April 30 April Valuation at: 2006 2005 Rate of increase in salaries 4.0% 3.8% Discount rate 5.1% 5.3% Inflation assumption 3.0% 2.8% Rate of increase in pensions in payment post-97 3.5% 3.6% Pre-97 receive 3% p. a. increases The mortality assumptions are the standard PA92 tables projected to 2014 for current pensioners and projected to 2024 for future pensioners.

Share-based payments The charge to the income statement in respect of share-based payments in the year, relating to grants of shares awarded under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan after 7 November 2002 and under The Berkeley Group Holdings 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan, was 6,347,500 2005: 3,533,300.
Employee share option schemes Pursuant to the Court sanctioned Scheme of Arrangement on 26 October 2004, approval of the Scheme of Arrangement triggered the rights of employees to exercise options under the Groups share option schemes.
At 30 April 2005, there were no options remaining exercisable under The Berkeley Group Executive Share Option Scheme the 1984 Scheme, The Berkeley Group plc 1994 SAYE Share Option Scheme the SAYE Scheme, The Berkeley Group plc 1994 Executive Share Option Scheme the 1994 Scheme, The Berkeley Group plc Executive Share Option Scheme 1996 the 1996 Scheme, The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Approved Share Option Plan the 2000 Approved Plan and The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Share Option Plan the 2000 Plan.
No further options will be granted under any of these schemes.
There is no charge to the income statement in respect of the Groups share option schemes in the year 2005: nil.
The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2000 LTIP No awards were granted under the 2000 LTIP during the year 2005: nil.
Further details on the 2000 LTIP are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 40.
The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan the 2004 b LTIP On 26 October 2004, under the terms of the 2004 b LTIP, the Company granted four Executive Directors the right to receive, at no cost, 21,321,361 Ordinary Shares in aggregate on 31 January 2011, if the Company has returned to shareholders 12 per share by that date.
The price of a Unit each Unit comprising one Ordinary Share of 5p, one 2006 B share of 5p, one 2008 B share of 5p and one 2010 B share of 5p in the Company at 26 October 2004 was 1,180p.
The fair value of the awards at the date of grant was 162p per Unit.
The fair value calculated was based on the share price at the date of grant, net of the discounted present value of expected returns to shareholders over the six-year vesting period.
The Company intends that, prior to 31 January 2011, substantially all returns to shareholders will be by way of payments made on the B shares 500p per Unit paid in December 2004, 200p per Unit payable in January 2007, 200p per Unit payable in January 2009 and 300p per Unit payable in January 2011.
None of the awards granted under this scheme are expected to lapse by 31 January 2011.
The charge to the income statement in the year of grant was 2,860,000, and the annual charge to the income statement thereafter until the vesting date is 5,610,000.
There were no further grants under the 2004 b LTIP in the year, and no further grants are expected under this scheme.
Further details on the terms applying to the 2004 b LTIP are set out in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 40.

9 Earnings per Ordinary Share Basic earnings per Ordinary Share is calculated as the profit for the financial period of 202,147,000 2005: 138,958,000 divided by the weighted average number of Ordinary Shares in issue during the year of 120,067,044 2005: 119,558,439 adjusted to exclude shares held by the Company to satisfy awards under its Long-Term Incentive Plan.
For diluted earnings per Ordinary Share, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume the conversion of all dilutive potential Ordinary Shares.

Additional disclosures are set out in the Financial review relating to risk management on pages 20 to 21.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of shareholders funds and net borrowings.
The Groups financial instruments comprise cash at bank and in hand, bank loans, loan stock, trade receivables and trade payables, loans from joint ventures and accruals.
From time to time the Group uses derivative instruments when commercially appropriate to manage cash flow risk by altering the interest rates on investments and funding so that the resulting exposure gives greater certainty of future costs.
During the year and at the year end the Group held no such instruments 2005: nil.
All of the operations carried out by the Group are in sterling and hence the Group has no exposure to currency risk.
Financial assets The Groups financial assets can be summarised as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Current Trade receivables 16,973 37,252 Cash at bank and in hand 220,670 344,948 237,643 382,200 Cash at bank and in hand is at floating rates linked to interest rates related to LIBOR.
The effective interest rate of cash at bank at the balance sheet date was 4.33% 2005: 4.68%.
Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing.
Together, these balances represent the Groups exposure to credit risk at the balance sheet date.
Trade debtors are spread across a wide number of customers, with no significant concentration of credit risk in one area.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities can be summarised as follows: 2006 2005 000 000 Current Unsecured loan stock 85 88 Trade payables 166,128 243,131 Loans from joint ventures 121 1,322 Accruals 26,056 43,903 192,390 288,444 Non-current Bank loans due after one year 600,000 Other non-current liabilities 15,294 32,968 15,294 632,968 All amounts included above are unsecured.

The effective interest rates at the balance sheet dates were as follows: 2006 2005 Unsecured loan stock 4.50% 4.75% Bank loans 5.50% The above analysis excludes the effect of the charge to finance costs imputed on land purchased on deferred settlement terms, since this represents an accounting transaction, with no interest being paid out of the Group.

The carrying amount of current trade and other receivables and of current trade and other payables approximate to their fair value as the transactions which give rise to these balances arise in the normal course of trade and, where relevant, with industry standard payment terms.
The unsecured loan stock is repayable at book value on three months notice being given to the Company.
Other non-current liabilities principally comprise long-term land creditors which are held at their discounted present value calculated by discounting expected future cash flows at prevailing interest rates and yields as appropriate.
The carrying value of bank loans equates to their fair value.
Committed borrowing facilities The Group has committed borrowing facilities, all at floating rates linked to LIBOR, as follows: 2006 2005 Available Drawn Undrawn Termination Available Drawn Undrawn Termination 000 000 000 Date 000 Date Seven year term facility 500,000 500,000 Aug 11 Revolving facility 375,000 375,000 Aug 11 175,000 100,000 75,000 Aug 07 364 day revolving facility with term out option 150,000 150,000 Aug 05 375,000 375,000 825,000 600,000 225,000 During the year, the Group repaid 100 million of loans drawn under the revolving facility and 500 million of loans drawn under the seven year term facility.

The termination date of the revolving facility was extended for a further four years to August 2011.

Joint ventures IAS 31 : The Group has elected to account for its investments in joint ventures using the equity method of accounting rather than adopting the proportionate consolidation method that is allowable under IAS 31.
This is consistent with the existing UK practice, subject to the following key difference.
Under IFRS, the Groups share of the results of joint ventures are presented net of interest and tax in one line in the consolidated income statement.
Under UK GAAP, the Groups share of the operating profit, interest and tax of joint ventures were disclosed separately.
Deferred taxation IAS 12 : Under IFRS, the Groups deferred tax asset is presented in non-current assets on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP, it was classified within other debtors in current assets.
Discontinued operations IFRS 5 : Under IFRS, the results and profit on disposal from discontinued operations are shown in one line below profit after taxation in the income statement.
Under UK GAAP, the results from discontinued operations were included line-by-line in the profit and loss account.
Merger expenses incurred as part of the Scheme of Arrangement and capital restructure in October 2004 are classified within operating expenses under IFRS.
Under UK GAAP, merger expenses were disclosed as a separate line item in the profit and loss account after operating profit.
b Group reconstruction In October 2004, the Group implemented a capital reorganisation, incorporating a Scheme of Arrangement, in order to effect the return of 12 per share to shareholders by January 2011.
co. uk 29 Reconciliation of net assets, profit and cash flows under UK GAAP to IFRS continued c Business combinations before the transition date IFRS 3 The Group has elected not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations that took place before the beginning of the first IFRS reporting period.
d Revenue recognition IAS 18 On traditional developments under UK GAAP, properties were treated as sold and profits were taken when contracts were exchanged and the building work was physically complete.
On complex multi-unit developments, revenue and profit were recognised on a staged basis, commencing when the building work was substantially complete, which was defined as being plastered, and when contracts were exchanged.
On transition to IFRS, the Group has amended its policy to recognise revenue on properties on both traditional and complex multi-unit developments when contracts are exchanged and the building work is physically complete.
This brings the policy on complex multi-unit developments into line with the Groups existing revenue recognition policy on traditional developments and reflects the provisions of IAS 18 Revenue.
The effect of this change in policy on the Group excluding joint ventures is to reduce opening reserves at 1 May 2004 by 25,413,000, and to reduce turnover, operating profit and retained profit for the year ended 30 April 2005 by 38,879,000, 11,272,000 and 7,890,000 respectively.
For joint ventures, opening reserves are reduced by 3,931,000 and the Groups share of retained profit for the year ended 30 April 2005 is increased by 1,895,000.
This gives rise to an overall reduction of net assets of 29,344,000 at 1 May 2004 and 35,339,000 5% at 30 April 2005.
This change in policy constitutes a timing difference in terms of the point at which revenue is recognised, and has no impact on the underlying profitability of the Group.
Profit in any one year will be higher or lower than under the existing policy based on the timing of build programmes.
There is no impact on the Groups net debt position as a result of the change in policy.
e Events after the Balance Sheet date IAS 10 IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet date requires that dividends approved after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that balance sheet date since the liability did not represent a present obligation at that date.
The final dividend approved in respect of the financial year ended 30 April 2004 of 19,646,000 has been reversed in the opening balance sheet at 1 May 2004 and is charged, based on shareholders on the register on 10 August 2004, in the year ended 30 April 2005. f Employee benefits IAS 19 Under UK GAAP, the Group previously applied SSAP 24 in respect of the Groups pension schemes, and provided detailed information under the FRS 17 transitional disclosures.
The Group has adopted IAS 19 Employee benefits in preparing the IFRS opening balance sheet, including the amendment to IAS 19 issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be charged or credited to equity through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The Groups opening IFRS balance sheet reflects the recognition of a net deficit of 6,214,000 after taking account of the related 2,663,000 deferred tax asset in respect of the Groups defined benefit scheme.
The transitional adjustment of 5,074,000 to opening reserves includes the reversal of SSAP 24 accounting under UK GAAP and the recognition of the net liabilities of the Groups defined benefit scheme.
The impact of the change to IAS 19 on the consolidated income statement for the year ended 30 April 2005 is a credit to retained profit of 363,000.
The actuarial loss of 2,284,000 net of associated deferred tax has been recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense.
g Share-based payments IFRS 2 The Group has elected to follow the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, and therefore to apply IFRS 2 only to grants under the Groups share option schemes and Long-Term Incentive Plans made after 7 November 2002 which had not vested by 1 January 2005.
All options under the Groups existing share option schemes had vested by 1 January 2005.
Further details are set out in Note 5 on page 58.
Of the four grants under The Berkeley Group plc 2000 Long-Term Incentive Plan, only the grant of 22 July 2003 has been accounted for as allowed under IFRS 2.
The change to IFRS 2 has no impact on the opening IFRS balance sheet, but the exclusion of the profit and loss charge in relation to the pre-November 2002 grants under the 2000 LTIP has reduced operating expenses by 679,000 in the year ended 30 April 2005.
Deferred tax on the 2000 LTIP is calculated at each reporting date based on an estimate of the future tax deduction.
The tax benefit up to the amount of the tax effect of the cumulative expense is recorded in the income statement, and the excess tax benefit above this amount is recorded in equity.
co. uk 75 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued year ended 30 April 2006 29 Reconciliation of net assets, profit and cash flows under UK GAAP to IFRS continued The Berkeley Group Holdings plc 2004 b Long-Term Incentive Plan was introduced during the year ended 30 April 2005, and the only grants under this scheme were those made to four Main Board Directors on Court approval of the Scheme of Arrangement on 26 October 2004.
As such these grants fall to be treated under IFRS 2.
The accounting treatment under IFRS 2 is similar to the UK GAAP treatment under UITF 17 revised and no significant adjustment arises on transition to IFRS.
h Land purchased on deferred settlement terms IAS 2 IAS 2 Inventories requires that, where a company purchases inventories on deferred settlement terms and the arrangement effectively contains a financing element, then that element should be recognised as interest expense over the period of financing.
This affects the Group in respect of long-term land creditors which have a price determined at inception but payable a year or more in the future which must be recognised at a discounted net present fair value on recognition, with the discount being unwound through finance costs over the period to settlement of the liability.
This adjustment does not affect net profit or net assets over time.
It is a reduction of work in progress and creditors by an equal amount in the balance sheet at inception, and a reclassification between cost of sales and finance costs in the income statement.
The timing of recognition of the finance costs on an effective interest basis and of the equivalent benefit in operating profit when sales are recognised on the relevant sites will however give rise to a net impact on net assets at each balance sheet date.
The impact of IAS 2 in the opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 May 2004 is to reduce inventories by 2,716,000 and to reduce other non-current creditors by 1,067,000, with an associated reduction of net assets, net of tax, of 1,154,000 at that date.
In the year ended 30 April 2005, this adjustment increases net finance costs payable by 1,206,000, and reduces cost of sales by 250,000.
In the closing balance sheet at 30 April 2005, inventories reduce by 5,646,000 and other non-current liabilities by 3,041,000, with an associated reduction of net assets, net of tax, of 1,824,000 at that date.
This change in accounting also affects the results of joint ventures.
The impact of this adjustment in the opening balance sheet at 1 May 2004 is to reduce investments in joint ventures and reserves by 4,511,000, and in the year ended 30 April 2005 to increase the Groups share of joint ventures profit after tax by 595,000, resulting in a reduction of investments in joint ventures of 3,916,000 at 30 April 2005.
The overall impact is a reduction of net assets of 5,665,000 at 1 May 2004 and 5,740,000 1% at 30 April 2005. i Financial instruments IAS 32 and IAS 39 The Group has elected to take the optional exemption from applying IAS 32 and IAS 39 in the comparative year and to first apply them at 1 May 2005 and for the year ended 30 April 2006.
There is no impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the results at 1 May 2004 and 30 April 2005.
In respect of another option allowed by IFRS 1, the Group has elected not to designate any financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or as available for sale on transition to IFRS.
j Property, plant and equipment IAS 16 Fair value of property plant and equipment on transition The Group has not previously applied a policy of revaluation to property, plant and equipment.
The Group will continue to hold property, plant and equipment at depreciated cost under IFRS.
The provisions of IFRS 1 allow companies to revalue property, plant and equipment to fair value on transition to IFRS, and to treat the fair value as deemed cost on transition, even where a policy of revaluation will not be applied going forward.
The Group has elected not to revalue property, plant and equipment to fair value on transition.
Therefore there is no adjustment to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment on transition to IFRS.
Residual value of property, plant and equipment Under IFRS, the residual value of property, plant and equipment should be reassessed annually based on values current at the balance sheet date rather than at the date of capitalisation of the asset under existing accounting.
If there is any change, future depreciation charges should be adjusted accordingly.
This change has no impact on the opening balance sheet at 1 May 2004, and has no material impact on the Groups results for the year ended 30 April 2005. k Cash flow statement The transition to IFRS does not result in any material changes to cash flows compared to UK GAAP.
Under IFRS, cash flows are classified as operating, investing or financing cash flows.
Tax and interest paid, and dividends received from joint ventures, are classifed within operating cash flows under IFRS, but were categorised within separate headings under UK GAAP.
