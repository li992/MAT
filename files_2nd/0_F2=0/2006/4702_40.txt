As noted in the basis of preparation, comparative information has not been restated.
The group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
All transactions in derivative financial instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from underlying business activities.
At 30 June 2005, current assets included other liquid resources of 30 million, and non-current liabilities included finance lease liabilities of 9 million.
22 Financial instruments and risk management Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity price movements that arise in the normal course of the groups business.
The groups treasury objectives, risk management strategies and polices are disclosed in the Operating and financial review see Risk management.
Exemption to restate comparative information for IFRS 7, IAS 32 and IAS 39 The comparative financial information in these financial statements does not comply with IFRS 7, IAS 32 and IAS 39 as the group has elected to apply the exemption permitted by IFRS 1.
As a result of these standards, a number of financial instruments have been recognised or revalued in the opening balance sheet at 1 July 2005 increasing reserves by 164 million before tax see note 26.
Financial instruments in the period ended 30 June 2005 remain recorded in accordance with the previous UK GAAP accounting policies under FRS 13. i Currency risk management The group publishes its consolidated financial statements in sterling and conducts business in many foreign currencies.
As a result, it is subject to foreign currency exchange risk due to exchange rate movements which will affect the groups transaction costs, and the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations.
Hedge of net investment in foreign operations The group hedges a substantial portion of its exposure to fluctuations on the translation into sterling of its foreign operations by holding net borrowings in foreign currencies and by using foreign currency swaps and forwards and cross currency interest rate swaps.
During the year ended 30 June 2006, the groups policy where a liquid foreign exchange market exists was to hedge currency exposure on its net foreign operations before net borrowings at approximately the following percentages 90% US dollars, 90% euros and 50% for other significant currencies.
This policy leaves the remaining part of the groups net foreign operations before net borrowings subject to currency movements.
The highly effective portion of exchange differences arising on the retranslation of foreign currency borrowings including foreign currency swaps and forwards is recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense to match exchange differences on foreign equity investments.
Any ineffectiveness is taken to the income statement in accordance with IAS 39.
Hedge documentation is prepared for all net investment hedges at inception and effectiveness testing is carried out quarterly.
Transaction exposure hedging For currencies in which there is an active market, the group seeks to hedge between 80% and 100% of forecast transactional foreign exchange rate risk, for up to a maximum of 21 months forward, using forward foreign currency exchange contracts.
The gain or loss on the hedge is recognised in reserves to the extent it is highly effective and recycled into the income statement at the same time as the underlying hedged transaction affects the income statement.
At 30 June 2006, as a result of the net investment and transaction exposure cover outlined above, the group had outstanding gross foreign exchange contracts as disclosed in note 22 vi.
Further quantitative analysis of the sensitivity to movements in currency rates is reported in the Market risk sensitivity analysis in the Operating and financial review.
104 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... ii Commodity price risk The group uses commodity futures and options to hedge against price risk in certain commodities.
All commodity futures and options contracts hedge a projected future purchase of raw material.
Commodity futures or options are then either closed out at the time the raw material is purchased or they are exchanged with the company manufacturing the raw material to determine the contract price.
Commodity contracts are held in the balance sheet at fair value and, to the extent that they are considered as an effective hedge under IAS 39, fair value movements are recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Open contracts at 30 June 2006 and gains and losses realised in the year were not significant.
iii Interest rate risk management The group has an exposure to interest rate risk arising principally on changes in US dollar, sterling and euro interest rates.
To manage interest rate risk, the group manages its proportion of fixed to variable rate borrowings within limits approved by the board, primarily through issuing long term fixed rate bonds, medium term notes and commercial paper, and by utilising interest rate swaps.
The profile of fixed rate to floating rate net borrowings is maintained according to a duration measure that is approximately equivalent to a 50% fixed and 50% floating amortising profile.
The duration measure and the number of years within the amortising profile depend on a template approved by the board, which indicated, as at 30 June 2006, that a higher proportion of fixed rate net borrowings was appropriate for the group.

Interest bearing financial liabilities comprise bonds, medium term notes, commercial paper issued, money market loans, repurchase and forward rate agreements, net obligations under finance leases, bank overdrafts and certain provisions.
Financial liabilities on which no interest is paid consist of: provisions payable after one year in respect of employee incentive plans and provisions for business disposals of 44 million: other payables of 226 million: and derivative financial instruments of 19 million.
Interest bearing financial assets comprise cash and cash equivalents and certain non-current investments, loans and other receivables.
Financial assets on which no interest is paid include certain non-current investments, loans and other receivables.

The comparative information in the table above has been restated for finance leases under IAS 17 but has not been restated for IFRS 7, IAS 32 and IAS 39 as the group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1.
The group had available undrawn committed bank facilities as follows: 2006 2005 million million Expiring within one year 676 631 Expiring in more than two years 1,070 1,157 1,746 1,788 Commitment fees are paid on the undrawn portion of these facilities.
Borrowings under these facilities will be at prevailing LIBOR rates plus an agreed margin, which is dependent on the period of drawdown.
These facilities can be used for general corporate purposes and, together with cash and cash equivalents, support the groups commercial paper programmes.
There are no financial covenants on the above short and long term borrowings.
Certain of these borrowings contain cross default provisions and negative pledges and related sale and lease back provisions.
The committed bank facilities are subject to a single financial covenant, being minimum interest cover ratio of two times defined as the ratio of operating profit before exceptional items, aggregated with share of associates profits, to net interest.
They are also subject to pari passu ranking and negative pledge covenants.
Any non-compliance with covenants underlying Diageos financing arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements, and any non-compliance with covenants may, in particular circumstances, lead to an acceleration of maturity on certain notes and the inability to access committed facilities.
Diageo was in full compliance with its financial covenants throughout each of the periods presented.

Total Designated Available Loans and Amortised carrying a Trading at fair value for sale receivables cost value Fair value million million million million million million million Cash and cash equivalents 699 699 699 Other liquid resources 49 49 49 Bank overdrafts 48 48 48 Borrowings due within one year 242 469 711 711 Borrowings due after one year 2,345 1,656 4,001 4,058 Derivative assets 9 55 64 64 Derivative liabilities 17 88 105 105 Other assets 51 1,534 1,585 1,585 Other liabilities 1,717 1,717 1,717 8 2,620 748 51 2,356 4,185 4,242 a Includes borrowings designated as hedged items in fair value hedging relationships with respect to foreign currency or interest rate risk.
Under IAS 39, all derivative financial instruments not in a hedge relationship are classified as trading.
The group does not use derivatives for speculative purposes.
The fair values of quoted borrowings are based on the asking price.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivatives, financial instruments and other financial assets and liabilities are estimated using appropriate yield curves at 30 June 2006 by discounting the future contractual cash flows to the net present values.
Fair value hedge relationships Certain borrowings due within and after one year are part of qualifying fair value interest rate hedging relationships.
Accordingly there is a fair value adjustment for these liabilities with respect to the hedged interest rate risk, with changes being recognised in the income statement, as disclosed in note 22 vi.
Diageo has not designated any financial assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition.
Fair values under UK GAAP As the comparative information in these financial statements has not been restated under IFRS 7, IAS 32 and IAS 39, the estimated fair values of borrowings, associated derivative financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets at 30 June 2005 are presented below in accordance with UK GAAP.
The fair values of quoted borrowings and guaranteed preferred securities are based on year end mid-market quoted prices.
The fair values of other borrowings, derivatives, financial instruments and other financial liabilities and assets are estimated using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end by discounting the future cash flows to the net present values.
These are based on rates obtained from third parties.
The fair value of the groups investment in General Mills, included in other financial assets at 30 June 2005 in the table below, is calculated using the quoted share price at 30 June 2005.

On 4 October 2004, 4 million of the shares over which the options were exercisable, were transferred to the groups UK pension fund, together with the relevant portion of the options.
The call options had a strike price of $51.56 and expired in October 2005.
The estimated fair value of the call options over the remaining 25 million General Mills shares held by Diageo at 30 June 2005 was 8 million $13 million.
The premium of $77 million received in respect of the remaining options was deferred and was included in accruals and deferred income in other payables.
The estimated fair value of the call options was derived using a Black Scholes model using market volatility, share price and interest rates as at 30 June 2005.
It was estimated that a 5% increase in the share price of General Mills would have increased the negative fair value by 9 million.
vi Hedging instruments Hedges under IFRS Diageo designates derivatives which qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either: a a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability fair value hedge : b a hedge of a forecast transaction or the cash flow risk from a change in interest rates cash flow hedge : or c a hedge of a net investment in foreign operations.
The accounting treatment for hedges is disclosed in Accounting policies of the group.
Diageo tests effectiveness on a prospective and retrospective basis to ensure compliance with IAS 39.
Methods for testing effectiveness include dollar offset, critical terms, regression analysis and volatility reduction.
All fair value hedges were highly effective during the year.
The loss on hedging instruments for the year was 117 million and the gain on the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks was 114 million, resulting in a 3 million net loss recognised in the income statement for the year.
For the year ended 30 June 2006 all cash flow hedges were highly effective and changes in fair value of 39 million have been recognised in equity.
A loss of 11 million and a gain of 7 million have been transferred out of equity to other operating expenses and to other finance income respectively in the year.
Balances related to cash flow hedged items at 30 June 2006 will affect the income statement in 2007 and 2008 by 19 million and 13 million respectively.
The ineffectiveness recognised in the income statement that arises from hedges of net investments in foreign operations was less than 1 million.

Cash and cash equivalents and other liquid resources principally comprise money market deposits, commercial paper and investments.
The investments are with counterparties with a long term credit rating of A or better.
At 30 June 2006, approximately 14% and 36% of the groups cash and cash equivalents and other liquid resources of 748 million were invested with counterparties based in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively.
At 30 June 2006, approximately 20% and 22% of the groups trade debtors of 1,332 million were due from counterparties based in the United Kingdom and United States, respectively.
