Resolution number 3 Dividend A final dividend for the year ended 16 September 2006 of 12.5p per ordinary share is recommended by the directors and is put to shareholders for their approval.
If approved, the dividend will be paid on 12 January 2007 to holders of ordinary shares on the register of shareholders of the Company at the close of business on 1 December 2006 making a total dividend in respect of the year ended 16 September 2006 of 18.75p per ordinary share.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, the shareholders cannot resolve to pay an amount greater than that recommended by the directors.
Resolution number 4 Directors fees The Articles of Association of the Company adopted in 1994 contained in Article 81.1 an annual limit on directors fees of 200,000 or such larger amount as the Company may by ordinary resolution decide.
In view of the passage of time and the number of non-executive directors now present on the board, it is proposed that this limit should be increased to 500,000.
The limit does not relate to the remuneration paid to the executive directors as employees.
The directors may pay additional sums to those directors who perform services which the directors consider go beyond the ordinary duties of a director as well as reimbursing travelling, hotel and other expenses properly incurred by directors.
Resolutions number 5 to 9 Directors Biographical details of the directors to be elected or re-elected can be found on pages 28 and 29 of the annual report and accounts.
In accordance with the Articles of Association Javier Ferrn and Lord Jay of Ewelme, having each been appointed a director since the last annual general meeting, are required to retire at this meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for election.
The board concluded that they would each add to the boards understanding of international relations and markets.
Please also see Chairmans statement on page 5.
Jeff Harris retires by rotation in accordance with the Articles of Association, and being eligible, offers himself for re-election.
In accordance with the Articles of Association and the Combined Code Galen Weston and Lord MacGregor, who have each served longer than nine years, and Jeff Harris will retire at the Annual General Meeting and seek re-election.
In proposing the re-election of the non-executive directors, the Chairman has confirmed that, following formal performance evaluation, each individual continues to make an effective and valuable contribution to the board and demonstrates commitment to the role.
Details of the performance evaluation process in relation to the directors can be found on page 33.
Resolutions number 11 and 12 Renewal of directors powers to allot shares The Companies Act 1985 prevents directors allotting unissued shares without the authority of shareholders in general meeting.
Resolution number 11 will authorise the directors to allot substantially all of the present unissued ordinary share capital, which represents approximately 25% of the Companys authorised share capital, and approximately 33% of the Companys issued ordinary share capital at 7 November 2006, at any time within the next five years.
The proposed renewal of the authority should not be taken as an indication that the directors have any current plans to make an issue of shares.
The directors propose to renew this authority every year asking, on each occasion, for the authority to be granted for a further period of five years.
Where shares are allotted pursuant to a general authority as provided in resolution number 11 and shareholders are required to pay for them in cash, that allotment is subject to Section 89 of the Companies Act, which requires new shares to be offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.
There may, however, be circumstances where directors wish to allot shares for cash other than by way of rights issue, open offer or other offer of securities and this cannot be done unless shareholders have first waived their pre-emption rights.
Resolution number 12 asks shareholders to do this by allowing the directors to allot for cash i by way of a rights issue, open offer or other offer of securities to all shareholders subject to certain exclusions and ii up to 5% of the Companys present issued ordinary share capital as at 7 November 2006 to persons other than existing shareholders.
By setting the 5% limit, interests of existing shareholders are protected, as their interest in the Company cannot, without their consent, be reduced by more than 5% by the issue of new shares for cash to new shareholders.
