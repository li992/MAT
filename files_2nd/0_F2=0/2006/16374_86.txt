At the Annual General Meetings of NV and PLC held on 8 May and 9 May 2006 respectively, shareholders approved proposals that the NV ordinary shares be split in the ratio 3 to 1 and that the PLC ordinary shares be consolidated in the ratio 9 to 20.
At the same time, amendments were made to NVs Articles of Association to convert into euros the share capital amounts previously denominated in Dutch guilders.
Following these changes, which became effective on 22 May 2006, the nominal value of each NV ordinary share is 0.16 and the nominal value of each 1 PLC ordinary share is 3 9p.
In the case of the NV ordinary shares, the new nominal value per share does not, for reasons of rounding, equate exactly to the equivalent value expressed in Dutch guilders.
As a result, the reported share capital issued at 31 December 2006 is 16 million lower than in 2005, with a corresponding amount being included in other reserves see note 23 on page 110.
In the case of the PLC ordinary shares, the euro conversion rate is now 1.00 5.143.
As at 31 December 2005 when the NV shares were denominated in Dutch guilders, the effective rate of exchange was 1.00 5.445.
This rate change results in a reduction in the euro equivalent of 12 million with a corresponding amount being included in other reserves see note 23 on page 110.
A nominal dividend of 6% is paid on the deferred stock of PLC, which is not redeemable.
Internal holdings The ordinary shares numbered 1 to 2 400 inclusive in NV Special Shares and deferred stock of PLC are held as to one half of each class by N. V. Elma a subsidiary of NV and one half by United Holdings Limited a subsidiary of PLC.
This capital is eliminated on consolidation.
It carried the right to nominate persons for election as Directors at general meetings of shareholders.
At NVs AGM held on 8 May 2006 and at PLCs AGM held on 9 May 2006 it was decided to abandon this right.
Accordingly, NVs and PLCs Articles of Association were amended so that for an alteration of the provisions within them relating to the unity of management between NV and PLC, prior approval is required from meetings of the holders of the NV Special Shares and the PLC Deferred Stock.
The subsidiaries mentioned above have waived their rights to dividends on their ordinary shares in NV.
Share-based compensation The Group operates a number of share-based compensation plans involving options and awards of ordinary shares of NV and PLC.
Full details of these plans are given in note 29 on pages 117 to 121.
