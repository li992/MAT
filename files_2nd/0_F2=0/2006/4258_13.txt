The directors are required to prepare financial statements for the Group in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS and have also elected to prepare financial statements for the Company in accordance with IFRS.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Companys financial position, financial performance and cash flows.
This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Boards Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable International Financial Reporting Standards.
Directors are also required to: properly select and apply accounting policies: present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information: and provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a directors report and directors remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the Company website.
Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements differs from legislation in other jurisdictions.

The address of the registered office is given on page 89.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Group operates.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures The directors anticipate that the adoption of this Standard in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the standard comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
All Standards and Interpretations that have been issued but are not yet effective have been considered and those that are applicable have been applied in these financial statements.
2 Accounting policies Basis of accounting The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs, as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRS, including all International Accounting Standards IAS, Standing Interpretations Committee SIC interpretations and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board IASB and effective before 29 December 2006.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
The financial statements cover the 52 week period from 31 December 2005 to 29 December 2006, the comparatives are presented for the 52 week period from 1 January 2005 to 30 December 2005.
The financial statements are reported on a 52 week basis to be consistent with the Groups internal reporting.
During 2006, the Group decided on the early adoption of IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and treasury share transactions.
This has resulted in a retrospective change in accounting policy for recording the grants of equity instruments in the Company to employees of its subsidiaries.
The retrospective application of this Interpretation has resulted in a restatement of the Company-only financial statements for the 52 weeks ended 30 December 2005.
There is no impact on the consolidated financial statements.
In 2005, the effect of the restatement on the Company-only financial statements was to increase the carrying amount of the Companys investment in subsidiaries by $3,167,000 and increase trade and other payables by $3,167,000.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of CSR plc the Company and entities controlled by the Company its subsidiaries drawn up to the dates indicated in the primary financial statements.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Business combinations The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair value, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the business combination.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair value at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill.
Any deficiency of the cost of the acquisition below the fair vale of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Groups interest in the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually.
Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Changing the way the world connects CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006 Continued 2 Accounting policies continued Goodwill continued On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benefits will flow to the Group.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed.
Royalty income is recognised upon shipment of the royalty earning product by the licencee.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered on a percentage of completion basis.
Revenue from post contract support is recognised over the period of performance.
The excess of service fees and post-contract support invoiced over revenue recognised is recorded as deferred income.
Revenue is shown net of estimated provision for credit notes and returns.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Leasing Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly to the income statement.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an operating lease are also spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Foreign currencies The functional currency of CSR plc is the US dollar.
Transactions in currencies other than US dollars are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the net profit or loss for the period.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group enters into forward contracts see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups overseas operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups exchange retranslation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
Operating profit Operating profit is stated before investment income and finance costs.
Retirement benefit costs Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due.
Differences between contributions payable in the period and contributions actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in the balance sheet.
Taxation The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year.
Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible.
The Groups liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences, unused carried forward tax losses and unused carried 66 | 67 2 Accounting policies continued Taxation continued forward tax credits can be utilised.
However, such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from: goodwill: the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit: investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxed levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment Plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of the assets, less estimated residual value, over their estimated useful lives, using the straight line method, on the following basis: Computer equipment 2 to 3 years Test equipment 2 to 5 years Office equipment 3 years Furniture and fittings 5 years Leasehold improvements minimum lease period Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
In general residual values are zero or negligible, due to the technical and specialised nature of assets held.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost.
Depreciation of these assets commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Other intangible assets Other intangible fixed assets are stated at cost or fair value for items acquired in business combinations, net of amortisation and any provision for impairment.
No amortisation is provided on assets in the course of construction.
On other intangible fixed assets amortisation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or fair value, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life as follows: Software licences licence term Customer contracts and relationships 3 years Purchased R&D 4 years Residual values are the estimated amount that the Group would obtain from disposal of the asset, after deducting estimated costs of disposal, if the asset were already of the age and in the condition expected at the end of its useful life, based on prices prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Changing the way the world connects CSR plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2006 NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the 52 weeks ended 29 December 2006 Continued 2 Accounting policies continued Research and development expenditure Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
An internally generated intangible asset arising from the Groups product development is recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: an asset is created that can be identified such as a new device or software : the project from which the asset arises meets the Groups criteria for assessing technical feasibility: it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits: and the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful lives.
Where no internally generated intangible asset can be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss.
If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss if any.
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present values using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset cash-generating unit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset cash-generating unit in prior years.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Cost is calculated using the FIFO method.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Investments Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Investments consist of money market deposits in USD, GBP, Euros and Indian Rupees.
Interest income is recorded as it accrues over the period of the investment at rates fixed at the time of inception.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits.
Financial liabilities and equity Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approved by the board of directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives.
The Group hedges forecast GBP expenditure for the following 11 to 15 months.
68 | 69 2 Accounting policies continued Financial instruments continued Derivative financial instruments are initially recorded at cost and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If the cash flow hedge of a firm commitment or forecasted transaction results in the recognition of an asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability.
For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in the same period in which the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects net profit or loss.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.
If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period.
Provisions Provisions for warranty and returns costs are recognised at the date of sale of the relevant products, at the directors best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Groups liability.
Provision is made for onerous contracts at the fair value of the minimum unavoidable lease payments.
Share-based payment The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment.
In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees, including share options with non-market based vesting conditions.
Equity settled share-based payments are measured at the fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes model for the majority of share options in issue.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
For certain share options which include TSR related conditions: the fair value is estimated through the use of a Monte-Carlo simulation.
3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below.
Inventory valuation Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions.
If actual market conditions are less favourable than those projected by management, additional inventory provisions may be required.
The carrying amount of inventory at 29 December 2006 was $106.5 million 2005: $69.7 million.
Impairment of goodwill The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired on at least an annual basis.
This requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.
The carrying amount of the goodwill at 29 December 2006 was $52.0 million 2005: $52.7 million.
Provisions Determining the level of provision required for returns and warranty claims, requires management to review the historic levels of usage whilst considering the growth in the business and other changes which have occurred in the manufacturing cycle.
The carrying amount of the provision at 29 December 2006 was $4.1 million 2005: $3.9 million.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is determined from a value in use calculation.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period.
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Group.
Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
72 | 73 11 Goodwill continued The calculation has been based on the most recent cash flow forecasts for the next 3 years which have been approved by management.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11%.
At the time of the acquisitions in 2005 the acquired entities included brought forward tax losses.
These were not recognised at the time of the acquisition as it was not considered probable that taxable profit would be available against which these losses could be utilised.
During 2006, a deferred tax asset has been recognised for some of these losses and, in accordance with IFRS 3, an equivalent adjustment has been made to goodwill.
The charge of $745,000 was included in administrative expenses.

The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.
Treasury deposits Treasury deposits represent bank deposits with an original maturity of over three months.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are bank balances and cash, treasury deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.

The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of counterparties and customers.
Interest rate risk The Group has no direct exposure to fluctuations of interest rates other than those on interest-bearing balances.
The majority of cash balances are held at fixed rates of interest.

27 Share-based payments CSR plc has grants and awards in the following Share Schemes which result in charges to the Income Statement: Global share option scheme The Company has a share option scheme for all employees of the Group, under which share options were issued prior to flotation, at a price based on the most recent private funding round.
All employees were granted options on joining CSR.
These options have a vesting period of 5 years, with 20% of options vesting 1 year after grant, then the remainder vesting in equal quarterly instalments over the remaining 4 years.
Other options in addition to those related to employees joining were also granted under this scheme.
In all cases if the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
No grants have been made under this scheme since flotation.
Company Share Option Plan CSOP The Company introduced a new scheme at flotation called the CSR plc Share Option Plan.
The following grants have been made under the scheme: Flotation grant On the Companys flotation in February 2004, the Company issued share options to all employees, at a price based on the share price on the day of flotation.
The vesting period is 3 years.
If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire.
Performance grants On the Companys flotation in February 2004, and in May 2005, May 2006 and certain other dates relating to employees joining the Company issued share options at a price based on the average share price over the preceding three days.
The vesting period of these grants is 3 years and vesting is dependent meeting certain EPS based performance conditions.
Starter grants The Company grants options to new starters to assist in recruitment.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average share price on the three days preceding the grant date or the immediately preceding dealing day.
The vesting period of the options is over a period of five years with 40% vesting after two years and 5% vesting each quarter thereafter.
Grants are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
The Company has also issued starter grants to senior employees that vest after three years.
CSR Share Award Plan In May 2005, following approval of shareholders at the 2005 Annual General Meeting, the Company introduced the CSR plc Share Award Plan, which allows for options to be granted for exercise at a future date at a price equivalent to the nominal value of the Companys shares of 0.001.
The following awards have been made: Retention Awards The Company issues certain employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 as a method of staff retention.
The vesting period of these share awards is 3 years.
If the share awards remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the awards expire.
Awards are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Performance Awards The Company issues certain employees with rights to purchase shares at nominal value 0.001 as a method of staff incentivisation.
The vesting of the awards is also subject to the Company satisfying two performance conditions.
The first is the Total Shareholder Return of the Companys shares when compared to a basket of companies selected at the time an award is first granted.
In order for the shares to vest, the Company must have met or exceeded certain TSR thresholds compared with the TSR performance of the basket of other companies.
In the event the Company satisfies any one of the TRS thresholds, the Remuneration Committee then considers the extent of any improvement in the underlying financial performance of the Company.
80 | 81 27 Share-based payments continued SAYE Schemes The Company operates a SAYE scheme, whereby employees are allowed to subscribe to a monthly savings amount for a period of 3 years: at the end of the three year period, the employee is allowed to either receive their saved amount plus interest or purchase shares in the Company at a price based on the average share price on the three days prior or the immediately preceding dealing day to each contract invitation date, discounted by 20%.
This scheme is open to all employees subject to Inland Revenue approved limits on total investment, and invitations are issued every six months.
Employees have a period of six months following the conclusion of each contract to exercise their option to purchase shares.

The aggregate estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates is $22,296,000.
The weighted average fair value of these options was $10.40.
In 2005, options were granted on 29 March, 4 April, 5 May, 1 November and 15 December.
The aggregate estimated fair value of the options granted on those dates is $7,575,000.
