The group finances its operations through a mixture of shareholders funds and borrowings.
To ensure flexibility, the majority of the borrowings are made under pre-arranged revolving credit facilities.
All of the operations of the Group are in sterling and hence the Group has no exposure to currency risk.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Financial assets The Groups financial assets can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Non-current Trade and other receivables 3.5 2.6 Available for sale financial assets 31.3 34.8 2.6 Current Trade receivables 12.5 8.5 0.8 Other receivables 21.4 19.3 Cash at bank and in hand 43.3 285.1 1.2 248.3 77.2 312.9 2.0 248.3 Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-interest bearing, and the group has no concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of customers and the amounts secured over a number of freehold and leasehold properties.
The directors consider that the carrying value of the available for sale assets is equal to their fair value as the time value of money is taken into account when calculating their carrying value.
Trade and other receivables Trade and other receivables are non-interest bearing, and the group has no concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a number of customers.
The carrying value of trade and other receivables are stated after an allowance for doubtful receivables has been made.
The allowance has been estimated by Group management based upon either specific knowledge or past experience of their assessment of the current economic environment.
The directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other receivables approximates to their fair value.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash at bank and in hand is held at floating interest rates linked to UK bank base rate.
Financial liabilities The Groups financial liabilities can be summarised as follows: Group Company 2006 2005 2006 2005 m m m m Current Loans and borrowings 5.9 4.8 49.1 3.3 Trade payables 698.6 779.7 2.1 1.6 Other payables 84.0 93.3 788.5 877.8 51.2 4.9 Non-current Loans and borrowings 2.5 3.4 Other non-current liabilities 124.3 92.8 126.8 96.2 Loans and borrowing Loans and borrowings are unsecured, with floating interest rates linked to UK bank base rate.
The directors consider that the carrying value of the loans and borrowings approximate to fair value as the interest rate on the loans and borrowing is linked to UK bank base rate.
Trade and other payables The directors consider that the carrying value of the trade and other payables approximates to fair value as a result of the short maturity period of the amounts as at the year end.
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS continued Other non-current liabilities Other non-current liabilities are unsecured and non-interest bearing.
The directors consider that the carrying value of the other non-current liabilities approximates to fair value as they are carried at their discounted present value of expected future cash flows using the effective interest rate method.
Maturity of non-current financial liabilities The maturity profile of the Groups non-current financial liabilities is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Financial liabilities non-current In more than one year but not more than two years 103.4 88.8 In more than two years but not more than five years 14.2 6.5 In more than five years 9.2 0.9 126.8 96.2 The undrawn committed borrowing facilities are: 62.8m 2005 69.4m expiring in one year or less, nil 2005 nil expiring in more than one year but not more than two years, 400.0m 2005 400.0m expiring in more than two years.
There is no material difference between book value and the fair value of the Groups financial assets and financial liabilities as at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS The Group operates a defined contribution and defined benefit scheme.
a DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEME The Group now operates a defined contribution scheme for employees.
The service cost of this scheme for the period was 1.8m 2005 1.2m.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.2m 2005 0.1m which were paid on or before the due date.
b DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME The Group operates a defined benefit scheme in the UK.
A full actuarial valuation was carried out at 30 November 2004 and updated to 30 June 2006 by a qualified independent actuary.
The defined benefit scheme is closed to new entrants.
The projected unit method has been used to calculate the current service cost.
This will rise over time as a percentage of payroll as the members of the scheme approach retirement.
At the balance sheet date there were outstanding contributions of 0.7m 2005 0.7m which were paid on or before the due date.
Following changes introduced by the Finance Act with effect from April 2006, the Barratt Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme has implemented revised terms for members exchanging pension at retirement date for a tax free lump sum.
The Directors consider that, with less than 3 months of experience since A-Day, insufficient time has elapsed as at 30 June 2006 to reliably estimate the changes in the commutation behaviour of scheme members in the longer term.
Accordingly, no gain or loss has been recognised in the period.
The main assumptions, fair value of assets and present value of obligations of the defined benefit scheme are set out below.

The grant of share options under the Plan is at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, taking into account individual performance and the overall performance of the Group.
Options must be held for a minimum of three years from the date of grant before they can be exercised and lapse if not exercised within ten years.
The exercise of options granted under the Plan is subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Remuneration Committee namely that the growth in the earnings per share of the Company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 6% for options granted in 1997 and 1998 and by at least 9% for those options granted in and since 1999.
In November 1999 the company adopted an employee share option plan.
The Board approves the grant of share options to employees under the plan which are normally exerciseable between 3 and 10 years from the date of grant.
The exercise of the options granted under the plan are subject to the achievement of an objective performance condition set by the Board, namely that the growth in the basic earnings per share of the company over a period of three consecutive financial years should exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by at least 9 per cent.

TRANSITION TO IFRS continued CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING As a result of complying with IFRS a number of changes are required to the way the Group and Company accounts reflect certain transactions.
The main changes are detailed below: a IFRS 2 Share-based payments In accordance with IFRS 2, the Group has recognised a charge for share options granted on or after 7 November 2002.
The fair value of these options has been calculated using a present economic value model.
The charge is spread over the vesting period and is adjusted to reflect pre-vesting forfeitures and, in the case of awards that are subject to a nonmarket based performance test, the actual and expected level of vesting.
The resultant charge to profit from operations for the year ended 30 June 2005 in respect of share-based payments was 3.8m, including 0.3m in respect of the Groups expected liability for National Insurance on unapproved options.
An estimate of the tax base of share options at the end of the period is determined by reference to the market value of the related share and the exercise price of the option at the reporting date multiplied by the proportion of the vesting period that has lapsed.
The deductible temporary difference results in the recognition of a deferred tax asset.
The deferred tax asset at 30 June 2004 was 0.3m and at 30 June 2005 was 1.4m.
b IFRS 5 Discontinued operations Under IFRS 5, the face of the income statement must include a single amount for the post tax profit or loss of the discontinued operations, together with any profit or loss on disposal.
The presentation adjustment removes the UK GAAP disclosure of including amounts on a line-by-line basis.
c IAS 7 Cash flow statements IAS 7 requires that the cash flow statement be reconciled to cash and cash equivalents.
As such, movements in bank loans and overdrafts due in less than one year have been included within the cash flow statement as a financing cash flow.
In addition there have been a number of reclassifications to categorise cash flows in the three required headings of operating, financing and investing.
Cash flows arising from taxes on income were reclassified as cash flows from operating activities, as it was not possible to identify elements associated with financing and investing activities.
Cash flows arising from interest payments were reclassified as cash flows from operating activities on the basis that they enter into the determination of profit.
d IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet date Under IAS 10 only dividends declared before the balance sheet date can be recorded as a liability.
As final dividends for the years ended 30 June 2004 and 30 June 2005 were declared after the year end, no liability should be recognised.
The impact of this adjustment is to increase net assets by 35.3m at 30 June 2004 and by 42.8m at 30 June 2005. e IAS 12 Income taxes IAS 12 encompasses the requirements of both current tax and deferred tax.
It takes a balance sheet approach that is based on temporary differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities.
The deferred tax adjustments are largely a reflection of the various accounting changes as part of this exercise.
These adjustments have been included in the reconciliations, together with the relevant IFRS IAS.
Under IFRS, the Groups deferred tax asset is presented in non-current assets on the face of the consolidated balance sheet.
Under UK GAAP, it was classified within other debtors in current assets.
f IAS 14 Segmental reporting As all of the Groups operations are within the United Kingdom, which is one economic environment in the context of the Groups activities, there are no geographic segments to be disclosed.
As all the Groups operations are in construction there are no business segments to be disclosed.
TRANSITION TO IFRS continued g IAS 16 Property, plant and equipment Fair value of property plant and equipment on transition The Group has not previously applied a policy of revaluation to property, plant and equipment.
The Group will continue to hold property, plant and equipment at depreciated cost under IFRS.
The provisions of IFRS 1 allow companies to revalue property, plant and equipment to fair value on transition to IFRS, and to treat the fair value as deemed cost on transition, even where a policy of revaluation will not be applied going forward.
The Group has elected not to revalue property, plant and equipment to fair value on transition.
Therefore, there is no adjustment to the carrying value of property, plant and equipment on transition to IFRS.
Residual value of property, plant and equipment Under IFRS, the residual value of property, plant and equipment should be reassessed annually based on values current at the balance sheet date rather than at the date of capitalisation of the asset under existing accounting.
If there is any change, future depreciation charges should be adjusted accordingly.
This change has no impact on the opening balance sheet at 1 July 2005, and has no material impact on the Groups results for the year ended 30 June 2005. h IAS 19 Employee benefits In respect of the defined benefit pension scheme, the Group is required to recognise the net deficit in the scheme on its balance sheet.
The net effect of this as at 30 June 2005, is to recognise a net deficit of 62.3m, consisting of a pension scheme deficit of 88.9m and a deferred tax asset of 26.6m.
Actuarial gains and losses are spread over a number of years, as an adjustment to the pension expense in the income statement, making use of the 10% corridor to reduce volatility.
i IAS 2 Inventories and IAS 39 Financial instruments : recognition and measurement IAS 2 requires that, where a company purchases inventories on deferred settlement terms and the arrangement effectively contains a refinancing element, then that element should be recognised as interest expense over the period of financing.
This affects the Group in respect of long-term land creditors which have a price determined at inception but payable a year or more in the future which must be recognised at a discounted net present fair value on recognition, with the discount being unwound through finance costs over the period to settlement of the liability.
In accordance with IAS 39, the deferred payments arising from land creditors are to be held at discounted present value, hence recognising a financing element on the deferred settlement terms.
The liability is then increased to the settlement value over the period of the deferral.
The value of the discount is expensed through finance costs in the consolidated income statement.
The effect on the opening balance sheet at 30 June 2005 was to reduce the value of the land bank by 19.6m, reduce land creditors by 5.3m, recognise a deferred tax asset of 4.3m and reduce opening reserves by 10.0m.
For the year ended 30 June 2005, this resulted in an increase in profit from operations of 1.9m, a charge of 7.7m to finance costs and a related tax credit of 1.7m.
