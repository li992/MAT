Notes to the Group financial statements 1 GENERAL INFORMATION Burren Energy plc the Company is a company incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 1985.
The address of the registered office is given on the inside back cover.
The nature of the Groups operations and its principal activities are set out in note 5 and in the Business review and the Financial review on pages 8 to 15.
These financial statements are presented in US dollars because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the Company and its subsidiaries together the Group operate.
Foreign operations are included in accordance with the policies set out in note 2.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 7 Financial instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRS 8 Operating Segments IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payments IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives IFRIC 11 IFRS2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the Group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when IFRS 7 comes into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of preparation The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRSs.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted for use in the European Union EU and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on a historic cost basis except for the revaluation of certain properties and financial instruments.
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below.
b Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial information of the Company and entities controlled by the Company made up to 31 December each year.
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method.
On acquisition, the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill, any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired i. e. discount on acquisition is credited to the income statement in the period of acquisition.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
The Group records any fair value uplift on piecemeal acquisition of a subsidiary within the relevant fixed asset caption, with the related balance being transferred to a revaluation reserve.
Where depreciation, depletion and amortisation charges are increased following such a fair value uplift, an amount equal to the increase is transferred annually from the revaluation reserve to retained earnings as a movement in equity.
c Investments in associates An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a position to exercise significant influence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee.
Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Investments in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the Groups share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in the value of individual investments.
39 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2006 Click to return to contents Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued d Oil & gas assets: exploration and evaluation The Group applies the full cost method of accounting for Exploration and Evaluation E&E costs, having regard to the requirements of IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources, which it adopted early, from the date of transition to IFRS.
Under the full cost method of accounting, costs of exploring for and evaluating oil & gas properties are accumulated and capitalised by reference to appropriate cost pools.
Such cost pools are based on geographic areas and are not larger than a segment.
The Group currently has four cost pools: the Caspian, West Africa, the Middle East North Africa and India.
E&E costs are initially capitalised within Intangible assets.
Such E&E costs may include costs of licence acquisition, technical services and studies, seismic acquisition, exploration drilling and testing, but do not include costs incurred prior to having obtained the legal rights to explore an area, which are expensed directly to the income statement as they are incurred.
Tangible assets acquired for use in E&E activities are classified as property, plant and equipment.
However, to the extent that such a tangible asset is consumed in developing an intangible E&E asset, the amount reflecting that consumption is recorded as part of the cost of the intangible asset.
Intangible E&E assets related to each exploration licence prospect are not depreciated and are carried forward until the existence or otherwise of commercial reserves has been determined.
The Groups definition of commercial reserves for such purpose is proven and probable reserves on an entitlement basis.
If commercial reserves have been discovered, the related E&E assets are assessed for impairment on a cost pool basis as set out below and any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying value, after any impairment loss, of the relevant E&E assets is then reclassified as development and production assets within property, plant and equipment.
Intangible E&E assets that relate to E&E activities that are determined not to have resulted in the discovery of commercial reserves remain capitalised as intangible E&E assets at cost less accumulated amortisation, subject to meeting a pool-wide impairment test as set out below.
Such E&E assets are amortised on a unit of production basis over the life of the commercial reserves of the pool to which they relate.
E&E assets are assessed for impairment when facts and circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable amount.
Such indicators include the point at which a determination is made as to whether or not commercial reserves exist.
Where the E&E assets concerned fall within the scope of an established full cost pool, the E&E assets are tested for impairment together with all development and production assets associated with that cost pool, as a single cash generating unit.
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the pool, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
Where the E&E assets to be tested fall outside the scope of any established cost pool, there will generally be no commercial reserves and the E&E assets concerned will generally be written off in full.
Any material impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and separately disclosed.
e Oil & gas assets: development and production Development and production assets are accumulated on a field-by-field basis and represent the cost of developing the commercial reserves discovered and bringing them into production, together with the E&E expenditures incurred in finding commercial reserves transferred from intangible E&E assets as outlined above.
The net book values of producing assets are depreciated on a field-by-field basis using the unit of production method by reference to the ratio of production in the period to the related commercial reserves of the field, taking into account estimated future development expenditures necessary to bring those reserves into production.
An impairment test is performed whenever events and circumstances arising during the development or production phase indicate that the carrying value of a development or production asset may exceed its recoverable amount.
The aggregate carrying value is compared against the expected recoverable amount of the cash generating unit, generally by reference to the present value of the future net cash flows expected to be derived from production of commercial reserves.
The cash generating unit applied for impairment test purposes is generally the field, except that a number of field interests may be grouped as a single cash generating unit where the cash flows of each field are interdependent.
f Decommissioning Where a material liability for the removal of production facilities and site restoration at the end of the productive life of a field exists, a provision for decommissioning is recognised.
The amount recognised is the present value of estimated future expenditure determined in accordance with local conditions and requirements.
A tangible fixed asset of an amount equivalent to the provision is also created and depreciated on a unit of production basis.
Changes in estimates are recognised prospectively, with corresponding adjustments to the provision and the associated fixed asset.
40 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2006 Click to return to contents 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued g Property, plant and equipment other than oil & gas assets Property, plant and equipment other than oil & gas assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of assets on a straight-line basis over their useful lives as follows: Plant and equipment 4 years Office furniture 4 years Barges and tugs 20 years h Oil & gas overlift and underlift Underlifts of entitlement to crude oil production are recorded as a debtor and measured at the lower of production cost, including depreciation, and market value, whereas overlifts are recorded as a creditor and measured at market value.
i Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of weighted average cost and net realisable value.
Cost comprises direct materials and where applicable direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Provision is made for obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where appropriate.
j Revenue recognition Revenue represents amounts invoiced exclusive of sales related taxes for the Groups share of oil sales or charter revenue in the year.
Oil sales revenue is recognised when the oil has been lifted and title has passed.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that assets net carrying amount.
k Shipping repairs and renewals Ships are dry-docked periodically and the costs are expensed as incurred.
Other maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.
l Foreign currencies Transactions in currencies other than US dollars foreign currencies are recorded in US dollars at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
At each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated into US dollars at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined.
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for the period, except for exchange differences arising on non-monetary assets and liabilities where the changes in fair value are recognised directly in equity.
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts and options see below for details of the Groups accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Groups subsidiaries which do not use US dollars as their functional currency are translated into US dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date.
Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly.
Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity and transferred to the Groups profit and loss reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which the operation is disposed of.
m Leases Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
41 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2006 Click to return to contents Notes to the Group financial statements continued 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued n Taxation The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas profits tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
o Financial instruments Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised at fair value on the Groups balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Trade receivables Trade receivables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts where there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired.
Trade payables Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their carrying value, as it approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these instruments.
Bank borrowings and loan notes Interest-bearing bank borrowings and loan notes are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Finance charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the income statement using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Equity instruments Equity instruments issued by the Company and Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting The Groups activities expose it primarily to fluctuations in the price of crude oil.
From time to time, the Group uses forward crude oil sales contracts, swaps and options to hedge these exposures.
The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Groups policies approven by the Board of Directors, which provide written principles and limits on the use of financial derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows are recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised within cost of sales in the income statement as they arise.
p Share-based payments The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Vesting conditions, other than market conditions, are not taken into account when estimating fair value.
Fair value is measured by use of a binomial model where there are conditions attached to the vesting and exercising of equity instruments.
The expected life used in the model is adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.

a Recoverability of exploration and evaluation costs Under the full cost method of accounting for E&E costs, such costs are capitalised as intangible assets by reference to appropriate cost pools, and are assessed for impairment when circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may exceed its recoverable value.
This assessment involves judgement as to: i the likely future commerciality of the asset and when such commerciality should be determined: ii future revenues and costs pertaining to any wider cost pool with which the asset in question is associated: and iii the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purpose of deriving a recoverable value.
Note 15 discloses the carrying amounts of the Groups E&E assets.
b Disposal of MBoundi Based on the fair value attributed to the eight-year licence extension received in consideration for the sale of the 3.5% interest in the MBoundi field, it was concluded that no gain or loss arose in respect of the disposal of the underlying interests.
This assessment involves judgement as to future revenues and costs attributable to the licence extension and the discount rate to be applied to such revenues and costs for the purposes of deriving a fair value.
The transaction is described in greater detail in note 34.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year, are discussed below.
a Decommissioning The Group has potential decommissioning obligations in respect of its producing interests in Turkmenistan and the Republic of Congo.
The extent to which a provision is required in respect of these potential obligations depends, inter alia, on the legal requirements at the time of decommissioning, the cost and timing of any necessary decommissioning works, and the discount rate to be applied to such costs.
In addition, in certain jurisdictions the local authorities assume liability for such costs if they elect to continue production activities at the end of the licence or Production Sharing Agreement PSA period, which in turn depends on the level of commercial reserves remaining at the time of expiry.
Based on these factors, the Directors do not believe that there is a material decommissioning liability at 31 December 2006 or 31 December 2005. b Reserves Development and production assets within Property, Plant and Equipment are depreciated on a unit of production basis at a rate calculated by reference to proven and probable entitlement reserves commercial reserves and incorporating the estimated future cost of developing and extracting those reserves.
Commercial reserves are determined using estimates of oil in place, recovery factors and future oil prices, the latter having an impact on the proportion of the gross reserves which are attributable to the host government under the terms of the PSA.
Future development costs are estimated using assumptions as to number of wells required to produce the commercial reserves, the cost of such wells and associated production facilities, and other capital costs.
The current long-term Brent oil price assumption used in the estimation of commercial reserves is US$45.00.
The impact upon commercial reserves and the aggregate depletion charge for the year of a US$5.00 variation in the long-term Brent oil price assumption is shown in the table below.
The carrying amount of development and production assets at 31 December 2006 is shown in note 16.
Commercial Depletion reserves charge Long-term Brent price million barrels US$000 US$40 106.7 69,000 US$45 105.0 69,553 US$50 103.5 70,100 The level of estimated commercial reserves is also a key determinant in assessing whether the carrying value of any of the Groups development and production assets has been impaired.

7 LOSS ON DISPOSAL OF SUBSIDIARY The Group concluded the sale of its Russian ship management company Prime Shipping on 28 February 2006.
The sale included three barge and tug combinations that Burren operated under finance lease purchase arrangements.
The purchaser assumed all continuing lease obligations relevant to the vessels.
The purchaser paid a cash consideration of $4,461,000, which was calculated to be equal to the book value of the tugs and barges and office assets in accordance with Russian accounting policies.
The carrying value of the assets reported in Group accounts under IFRSs was higher at $5,024,000, resulting in a reported loss on the transaction of $563,000.
The disposal of Prime Shipping does not represent a discontinued operation as the Group is continuing to operate in the shipping business.
The net assets at the date of disposal were as follows: 28 February 2006 US$000 Property, plant and equipment 6,695 Inventory 2,947 Trade and other receivables 525 Cash and cash equivalents 211 Trade and other payables 5,354 5,024 Loss on disposal 563 Total consideration settled by cash 4,461 8 OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES 2006 2005 $000 $000 Write-off pre-licence expenditure 8,765 1,411 Impairment of exploration expenditure 6,018 Supplementary insurance charge 4,517 Total other operating expenses 19,300 1,411 Write-off of pre-licence expenditure relates predominantly to the Former Soviet Union, the impairment of exploration expenditure relates to Egypt and the supplementary insurance charge arose in respect of a dispute in Turkmenistan.

Accordingly, the applicable tax rate used above is the average statutory rate of tax, weighted in proportion to accounting profits, applicable across the Group.
The Groups tax liability in the Republic of Congo is settled out of its share of oil under the terms of PSA and, as such, is not reflected in the tax charge for the year.
Oil allocated to the Congolese Government under the terms of the Production Sharing Agreements relevant to the MBoundi and Kouakouala fields includes and satisfies in full any liability of the Group to profits tax in Congo calculated at the statutory rate of 35% specified by the Hydrocarbons Code.
The deferred tax provision at 31 December 2006 and 31 December 2005 is made up solely from accelerated tax depreciation and the movement in both years has been charged to the income statement.
A deferred tax asset of US$37,787,000 at 31 December 2006 in the UK 2005: US$20,947,000, principally relating to carried forward tax losses, deferred share scheme deductions and foreign tax credits, has not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence of suitable UK taxable profits in the foreseeable future to enable the asset to be recovered.
UK tax losses do not have an expiration date.
Deferred tax assets of US$1,101,000 at 31 December 2006 in Cyprus 2005: US$654,000 and US$1,834,000 at 31 December 2006 2005: US$1,356,000 in Russia relating to tax losses, have not been recognised on the grounds that there is insufficient evidence of suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future to enable the assets to be recovered.
Cypriot tax losses do not have an expiration date: however, Russian tax losses expire after three years.
At the balance sheet date, the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised was US$519,555,000 2005: US$308,145,000.
No liability has been recognised in respect of these differences because the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse or otherwise result in tax falling due in the foreseeable future.

During 2003, certain of the Groups property, plant and equipment were revalued due to the piecemeal acquisition of a subsidiary relating to the Groups West African operations.
On an historical cost basis, the carrying value of the Groups development and production assets West Africa would have been US$175,934,000 2005: US$137,541,000.
The Group has pledged all its development and production assets in Turkmenistan and Congo, which account for substantially all of the development and production assets in the above table, as security for a medium-term loan facility granted to the Group.
17 INTEREST IN ASSOCIATE This represents the Groups investment in Hindustan Oil Exploration Company Limited HOEC, a publicly quoted Indian oil & gas exploration and production company.
The movement in the Groups investment in HOEC is as follows: US$000 At acquisition 26,010 Additional purchase of shares 12 Share of profit to 31 December 2005 1,612 Dividends received 340 At 1 January 2006 27,294 Additional purchase of shares 9,932 Share of profit to 31 December 2006 3,362 Dividends received 340 At 31 December 2006 40,248 Following the HOEC rights issue in September 2006, Burren applied for its full rights entitlement and was awarded 5,984,830 shares for a consideration of US$9,932,000, this increased the Groups investment to 27.16%.
49 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2006 Click to return to contents Notes to the Group financial statements continued 17 INTEREST IN ASSOCIATE continued Aggregated amounts relating to HOEC are as follows: 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 Total assets 177,894 83,315 Total liabilities 73,729 26,079 Revenue 29,167 17,641 Profit 12,379 6,200 The fair value of the Groups interest in HOEC at 31 December 2006 was US$44,126,000 2005: US$55,408,000.
In the prior year Hardy Oil & gas Limited Hardy instigated a legal action against the Group asserting that the acquisition of its interest in HOEC infringed upon certain of Hardys rights in relation to HOEC.
During 2006 this action was determined in favour of the Group.
18 INVENTORIES 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 Materials 14,154 12,340 Crude oil 165 327 Total inventories 14,319 12,667 19 TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 Trade debtors 31,853 35,603 Other debtors 5,013 3,763 Underlift 7,184 2,903 Prepayments 24,454 21,864 Total trade and other receivables 68,504 64,133 Pre-payments at 31 December 2006 include cash collateral of US$18,937,466 2005: US$15,837,632 deposited with a financial institution in connection with exploration commitments.
The average credit period given on sales of crude oil is 30 days from bill of lading.
No interest is charged on the receivables.
An allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of crude of US$103,000 2005: US$103,000.
This allowance has been determined by reference to past default experience.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade debtors and other debtors approximates their fair value.
Credit risk The Groups principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents, trade debtors and other debtors.
Trade debtors are presented in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables.
An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash flows.
The credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is considered by management to be limited because the counterparties are financial institutions with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.
The Group has a significant concentration of credit risk within its trade debtors since its Turkmenistan production and its Republic of Congo production are each sold to a single purchaser.
However, in each case, the purchaser is part of a major international oil group and, therefore, the credit risk is considered by management to be acceptable.
20 TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 Trade creditors and accruals 68,051 57,793 Trade creditors and accruals principally comprise amounts outstanding for trade purchases and ongoing costs.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases is 79 days 2005: 68 days.
During 2005, the third and final threshold was reached in relation to certain deferred purchase payments resulting from the Groups purchase of its oil & gas interests in Turkmenistan during 2000.
Accordingly, an amount of US$23,333,333 in respect of the resulting deferred payment has been included in trade creditors and accruals for both periods shown above, and capitalised within property, plant and equipment.
This amount was paid in February 2007.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates their fair value.

At 31 December 2006, there were no open derivative positions.
In the prior year derivative contracts were not designated as accounting hedges and accordingly the movement in fair values, amounting to a gain of US$10,528,000, was taken to the income statement.
Together with realised losses of US$24,288,000 this resulted in a total loss on oil price derivatives contracts of US$13,760,000.
22 LONG TERM BORROWINGS The Group has a facility agreement with a syndicate of banks for a US dollar revolving borrowing base loan facility of up to US$150,000,000 which matures in 2009.
The amount of the facility currently available is US$70,000,000.
Amounts drawn bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin and the facility is secured via a charge over the Groups shares in: i Burren Resources Petroleum Limited, which holds the Groups interests in Turkmenistan: and ii Burren Energy Congo Limited, which holds the Groups interests in Congo.
No amounts were drawn under this loan facility at the year-end or during the year.

53 Burren Energy plc annual report and accounts 2006 Click to return to contents Notes to the Group financial statements continued 31 SHARE BASED PAYMENTS AND OTHER INCENTIVE SCHEME ARRANGEMENTS A summary of the Groups employee incentive schemes and how they are accounted for under IFRS 2, is set out below.
Performance Share Plan the PSP One set of awards comprising an option to acquire shares in the Company for nil payment was made on 12 November 2003 in respect of an aggregate of 481,922 ordinary shares.
Vesting of these awards was dependent on a number of share price performance targets being met in the three-year period following the Companys flotation in December 2003.
All such performance conditions were met and the shares vested on 12 November 2006.
Burren Energy Annual Profit Sharing Scheme the APSS Under the APSS, 5% of the Groups operating profit on ordinary activities after deduction of interest, financing charges, taxation and the amount of the bonus pool itself, is allocated as annual bonus pool for the benefit of its employees.
Any individual bonus amount up to 50% of annual base salary with respect to Executive Directors and Senior Managers and 100% of base annual salary for all other staff, may be paid in cash and any bonus payment in excess of these limits is made in the form of a right to acquire shares in the Company, the exercise of which is deferred for a period of three years a Deferred APSS Award.
No payment is required from the option holder upon exercise.
The number of shares in the Company subject to a Deferred APSS award will normally be calculated using the Companys average share price over the last 30 days of the financial year to which the Deferred APSS Award relates.
The Deferred APSS Award will normally be able to be exercised in the six months commencing from the third anniversary of the end of the financial year to which the award relates.
The share based elements of the above schemes are substantially similar, involving the award of equity settled share options at a nil exercise price, and accordingly the information for the schemes has been aggregated.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year in respect of these two schemes are as follows: 2006 2005 Number of Number of share options share options Outstanding at beginning of period 873,644 608,459 Granted during the period 445,257 265,185 Exercised during the period 57,692 Outstanding at the end of the period 1,261,209 873,644 Exercisable at the end of the period 424,230 57,692 share options were exercised during the year in respect of the above schemes.
Options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.37 years 2005: 1.71 years.
As all of the share options have a nil exercise price the fair value at the date of grant was assumed to be equal to the share price on that day.
For share options granted in the year, the weighted average fair value of the options at measurement date was US$15.69 per share 2005: US$8.88 per share based on the Groups share price on the date of grant.
During 2006, a charge of US$3,538,207 2005: US$1,261,000 was recorded in respect of equity settled share payments accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
Under IFRS 2, charges in relation to equity settled share based payments are credited to a Shares to be Issued Reserve, therefore no liabilities have been recorded in respect of these schemes.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS and Long Term Incentive Plan 2003 LTIP The share options in these schemes were all either granted prior to 7 November 2002 or had vested by 1 January 2005 and therefore do not fall within the scope of IFRS 2.
Accordingly, the only charges arising in 2005 and 2006 in relation to these schemes relates to National Insurance Contributions NICs, based on the Companys share price at the balance sheet date see below.
Under the Long Term Incentive Plan, awards may be taken in the form of shares or cash consideration at the discretion of the employee.
The award is dependent on meeting performance criteria as set out and determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The amounts in place at 31 December 2005 relate to awards in respect of the performance year ended 31 March 2003, which have fully vested.
Summary of charges to the income statement The total charge in relation to the Groups share based payment arrangements was as follows: 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 APSS cash element 1,286 3,632 deferred bonus 3,215 886 PSP 324 375 NICs on ESOS 389 1,611 NICs on LTIP 92 927 Total 5,306 7,431 Included in charges for incentive schemes is US$1,286,000 2005: US$3,632,000 relating to the cash element of the APSS which does not fall within the scope of IFRS 2 and is charged to the profit and loss account in the year of award.
