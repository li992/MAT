Financial risk management The Groups financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources and various items such as trade receivables and payables that arise directly from its operations.
Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Groups business.
Management monitors liquidity to ensure that sufficient liquid resources are available to the Group.
The Groups principal financial assets are cash, bank deposits and trade and other receivables.
The Groups credit risk is primarily attributable to receivables from payment processors and from customers who dispute their deposits made after playing on the Groups websites.
The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset on the balance sheet.
The Group has made provision against $69.9 million of payment processor receivables following the enactment of the UIGEA.
There is no other significant concentration of credit risk.
Investments are allowed only in liquid securities and only with counter parties that have a credit rating equal to or better than the Group.
The Group considers that its exposure to credit risk on investments is acceptable and will continue to monitor this position.
The Group has no significant exposure to interest rate risk given that it has a net cash position.
The Group incurs foreign currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than US dollars.
The Group continually monitors the foreign currency risk and takes steps to ensure that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level.
In July 2006 the Group entered into a five year $500 million revolving credit facility the Facility.
Following the passing of the UIGEA by the US Congress on 30 September 2006 and the subsequent signing into legislation by President Bush the terms of the Facility prevented additional drawings.
On 30 September the Group commenced discussions with the lenders of the Facility to establish if there was a basis for a continuance.
No basis for continuing the Facility was established.
Drawings on the Facility at 31 December 2006 were $12 million.
The Group will repay the $12 million drawing on or before 30 April 2007, following which the Facility will be automatically cancelled.
