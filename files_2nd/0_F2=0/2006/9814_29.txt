Recoverable amounts are determined based on the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell.
The carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated 68.7m 2005: 67.4m to Pathfinder Pubs, 69.2m 2005: 53.2m to The Union Pub Company, and 10.4m 2005: 10.4m to WDB Brands.

Other commercial assumptions relate to market growth, market share and net selling prices.
These assumptions are based on historic trends adjusted for management estimates of future prospects.
