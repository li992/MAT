24 Borrowings continued The old debt facility, entered into in November 2005, consisted of the following arrangements: A 170 million term loan bridge facility.
The rate of interest was LIBOR plus 0.75% up to 30 June 2006 and LIBOR plus 1.0% thereafter.
Only 150 million of the facility has been utilised to date and of this 100 million was repaid in June 2006, 36 million in July 2006 and the balance of 14 million was repaid in August 2006.
The rate of interest is LIBOR plus 1.5%, plus mandatory costs.
The loan was repaid in full in April 2006.
$105 million of the loan was repaid in April 2006 and the balance of $20 million was repaid in June 2006.
A 150 million letter of credit LOC facility.
This was deposited with Lloyds in November 2005 as part of the Groups Funds at Lloyds FAL required to support underwriting on Syndicate 2001.
The LOC was replaced with part of the proceeds from the issue of the subordinated debt in April 2006.
Currently the facility is not being utilised but is being retained to provide additional financial strength and flexibility.
On 13 November 2006 the Company entered into a new debt facility with its banks, which replaced the 2005 facility.
The new facility is available for three years from the signing date and provides an unsecured 200 million multicurrency revolving credit facility available by way of cash advances or sterling letters of credit.
The facility is guaranteed by the Companys subsidiaries Amlin Corporate Services Limited and Amlin Investments Limited.
In December 2006 Amlin Bermuda Ltd entered into a $300 million LOC and Revolving Credit Facility.
The facility comprised a secured LOC facility for $200 million for a three year term and an unsecured revolving credit facility for $100 million for a term of 364 days, twice renewable.
The secured LOC facility is secured by a registered charge over a portfolio of assets managed by Aberdeen Asset Management Limited with State Street Bank and Trust Company as custodian.
As at 31 December 2006 $1.7 million LOCs were issued with an additional $8.8 million issued in January 2007.

Amlin plc Annual Report 2006 111 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued a The Lloyds Superannuation Fund funded defined benefit scheme The scheme is operated as part of the Lloyds Superannuation Fund the Fund.
Historically the Fund has catered for a number of employers in the Lloyds market.
As a consequence of the consolidation in the market, employers closing final salary schemes and some companies failing, there are now only around five 2005: six employers with active members in the Fund.
A large proportion of the liability of the Fund relates to employers no longer participating in the Fund.
The assets of the Fund are pooled and the current active employers are responsible collectively for the funding of the Fund as a whole.
For the purposes of determining contributions to be paid, the Trustees have split the Fund into a number of notional sections.
This is a notional split and has no legal force.
Previously this notional split allowed for separate sections in respect of each employers active members and one combined section for non-employed members of all current and former employers.
With effect from 31 December 2002, the Trustees altered this notional split so that, from that date, the active employers contributing to the Fund, including the Amlin Group, have individual notional sections comprising the notionally allocated assets in respect of their active employees, deferred pensioners and pensioners, and their corresponding liabilities.
A separate notional fund is maintained for members whose former employers no longer contribute to the Fund Orphan Schemes.
Amlin is also liable for a proportion of the Orphan Schemes liabilities.
Since this alteration Amlin can now more clearly identify its expected contribution requirement to the Fund.
However, as the asset allocation is notional and at the discretion of the Trustee, it is not possible for Amlin to be certain of its overall surplus or deficit at any time.
Indeed, as other employers have bought themselves out of the scheme in recent years, Amlin has been notionally allocated an increased share of the scheme.
For this reason the scheme continues to be classified as a multi-employer scheme for the purposes of International Accounting Standard No 19 IAS 19, Employee Benefits.
Due to an amendment to IAS 19 the Group is now required to recognise the net present value of any contribution schedule that has been agreed with the Trustees.
A prior period adjustment has been made this year and details of the effect of this can be found in the accounting policies section to these accounts on page 77.
Therefore, 0.2 million 2005: 0.4 million was charged to the Group result relating to the unwinding of the discount on the future contractual payments.
The total amounts paid in respect of the Fund for Syndicate 2001 and Amlin Group companies are analysed in the table below.
2006 2005 m m Contributions relating to: 2004 valuation deficit Amlin scheme 1.2 1.2 2004 valuation deficit Orphan scheme 3.5 3.5 Ongoing funding 1.3 1.3 6.0 6.0 Group share of total payment 6.0 5.5 The funding position of the Fund is assessed every three years by an independent qualified actuary.
Contributions are made at the funding rates recommended by the actuary, which vary across different sections of the Fund reflecting the notional sections then adopted, and typically include adjustments to amortise any funding surplus or shortfall over a period.
Amounts borne under the scheme are charged to Syndicate 2001 or other Group companies.
However, actuarial amounts quoted below are for Groups share of the scheme.
The last formal valuation of the Fund was as at 31 March 2004 and was carried out by Mr P Lofthouse, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, and used the projected unit credit actuarial method.
This valuation has since been updated to 31 December 2005 and 2006 using appropriate techniques and the following assumptions: 2006 2005 % pa % pa Price inflation 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase in pay 4.8 Rate of increase in pensions payment - LPI maximum 5% pa 3.1 2.8 - LPI minimum 3% pa, maximum 5% pa 3.25 3.25 - LPI maximum 3% pa 3.0 2.8 Rate of increase of statutory revaluation on deferred pension 3.1 2.8 Discount rate 5.1 4.7 During 2005 the Group reviewed its remaining defined benefit arrangements and made a number of changes to the schemes operations, which were implemented during the year.
In particular, in order to remove much of the risk associated with salary inflation, the scheme was changed to allow members to continue accruing additional years service under the schemes, but these accruals would be generally based on March 2006 pensionable salaries.
Future salary increases are pensionable through the defined contribution schemes.
Therefore the salary inflation assumption used for the ongoing valuation is now nil%.
112 Amlin plc Annual Report 2006 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued The mortality assumptions used in the latest valuation included the following life expectancies: 31 December 2006 31 December 2005 Life expectancy years at age 65 for a member currently: Male Female Male Female Aged 65 19.6 22.6 19.5 22.6 Aged 45 20.9 23.9 20.9 23.9 The analysis of the Funds assets and the expected rate of return at the balance sheet date are as follows: Asset mix 31 December 2006 Asset mix 31 December 2005 Long term rate of return Amlin Orphans Amlin Orphans 31 December 31 December Section Section Section Section 2006 2005 Equities 45% 20% 50% 20% 7.5% 7.5% Bonds 55% 80% 50% 80% 4.9% 4.5% The long term rates of return are estimated by the Directors based upon current expectations of future investment performance.
The updated assessment at 31 December 2006 showed that the assets relating to the Amlin section of the Fund were 146 million 2005: 136.9 million, being 4 million greater than 2005: 9.6 million less than the amount required to fund members accrued liabilities on the assumptions adopted, resulting in a surplus of 2.8% 2005: shortfall of 6.5%.
In 2004 Amlin agreed with the Trustee that it would make six annual payments to the Fund of 1.2 million.
This agreement was based on the formal valuation at 31 March 2004 and not the updated valuation at 31 December 2004.
The first payment was made in December 2004 and five subsequent annual payments were agreed commencing on 31 March 2005.
In addition, the updated assessment at 31 December 2005 showed that the assets notionally allocated to Amlin for the orphans section of the Fund were 169 million 2005: 168 million, being 7 million greater than 2005: 3.8 million greater than the amount required to fund members accrued liabilities on the assumptions adopted.
However, it should be noted that there is currently uncertainty concerning the eligibility of another part of the notional Orphan scheme for statutory revaluation of their benefits.
This matter is under legal scrutiny and the figures noted above assume that no such revaluation applies.
If it were to apply and the Trustees allocated Amlin proportionate liability to the remainder of the Orphan scheme, the past service obligations would increase up to 7 million.
In 2004 Amlin agreed to pay contributions to the notional orphans section to rectify a share of the funding shortfall revealed in the actuarial valuation at 31 March 2004, when the Group and Syndicates share of the shortfall was estimated to be 11.4 million and 12.8 million respectively.
The first payment of 3.5 million was made on 31 December 2004.
Three subsequent annual payments of 3.5 million were agreed commencing on 31 March 2005.
Contributions will also be paid to provide for the cost of benefit accrual after the date of the valuation.
The rate of contribution agreed with the Trustee is 30% 2005: 30% paid by the employer plus 5% 2005: 5% member contributions, in each case of pensionable earnings, and totalled 1.3 million 2005: 1.3 million.
b J E Mumford Underwriting Agencies Limited retirement benefit scheme The scheme consists of a closed funded defined benefit scheme for certain past employees of a subsidiary of the Company, Angerstein Underwriting Limited.
In February 2007, the liabilities of the scheme were closed into the Lloyds Superannuation Fund.
Contributions to the scheme are determined by an independent qualified actuary, based upon triennial valuations, using the attained age actuarial method.
The last formal valuation of the scheme was carried out at 1 July 2004 by Mr S Hymans, Fellow of the Institute of Actuaries.
This valuation has since been updated to 31 December 2005 and 2006 using appropriate techniques and the following key assumptions: 2006 2005 % pa % pa Price inflation 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase in pay 4.8 Rate of increase of pensions in payment 3.1 2.8 Rate of increase of pensions in deferment 3.1 2.8 Discount rate 5.1 4.7 Expected long-term return on plan assets 7.5 6.5 Amlin plc Annual Report 2006 113 Notes to the accounts For the year ended 31 December 2006 25 Retirement benefit obligations continued As described in section a above the salary inflation assumption has been reduced to nil% due to changes that were made to the operation of the Groups defined benefit schemes in 2006.
