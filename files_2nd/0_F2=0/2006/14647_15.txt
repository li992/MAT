38 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1.
Corporate information The Groups consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2006 were authorised for issue by the Board of directors on 1 March 2007.
Spirent Communications plc is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales.
The Companys Ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange and, in the form of American Depositary Shares, on the New York Stock Exchange.
As required by the European Unions IAS Regulation and the Companies Act 1985, the Group has prepared its consolidated financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS as adopted by the European Union EU.
Summary of significant accounting policies Basis of preparation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention modied to include revaluation to fair value of certain instruments as described below.
The Group has prepared its financial statements under IFRS.
The significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below.
Basis of consolidation The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries made up to 31 December each year.
The financial statements of subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent Company, using consistent accounting policies.
Results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group and cease to be consolidated from the date on which control is transferred out of the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interests in associates and joint venture The consolidated financial statements include the Groups share of profits or losses of associates and joint ventures.
Associates are those in which the Group is in a position to exercise significant inuence, but not control or joint control, through participation in the operating policy decisions of the investee.
Results are based on management accounts to 31 December each year.
The investment in associates is accounted for using the equity method and carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Groups share of net assets of the associate, less any impairment in value.
Jointly controlled entities in which the Group enters into a contractual arrangement to undertake an economic activity with another party or parties that is subject to joint control are treated as joint ventures.
The investment in joint ventures is accounted for using the equity method.
Goodwill Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiaries, representing the excess of cost over the net fair value of the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired, is capitalised as an intangible asset.
Goodwill is carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to the related cash-generating units monitored by management, usually at business segment level or statutory company level as the case may be.
Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
The carrying amount of goodwill allocated to a cash-generating unit, an operation within a cash-generating unit, an associate or jointly controlled entity is included in the profit or loss on its disposal.
Intangible assets Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Separately identiable intangible assets such as patent fees, licence fees, trademarks and customer lists and relationships are capitalised on the balance sheet only when the value can be measured reliably or the intangible asset is purchased as part of the acquisition of a business.
Such intangible assets are amortised over their useful economic lives on a straight line basis.
The carrying value of intangible assets is reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 39 Intangible assets arising on the Groups various product development projects are recognised only if all of the following conditions are met: i an asset is created that can be separately identied such as software or a new process : ii it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benets: iii the development cost can be measured reliably: iv it is intended that the asset is completed and used: and v there is adequate financial, technical and other resources to complete, use or sell the asset.
Product development costs are expensed as incurred until the technological feasibility of the product under development has been established.
Technological feasibility in Spirents circumstances occurs when a working model is completed.
For software development technological feasibility is not established until the process of developing the software is complete.
After technological feasibility is established, additional costs are capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life.
Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of all other assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis at rates which take into account commercial conditions at their location.
Usual asset lives are as follows: Freehold buildings 50 years Properties held under finance leases Over the lease period Plant and machinery 3 to 8 years Fixtures, ttings and equipment Building installations 20 years or lease period if less Fittings and equipment 3 to 8 years Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years Business systems software 4 years The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment of assets The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired.
If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount.
An assets recoverable amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating units fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets.
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the asset.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement of those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased.
If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised.
If that is the case the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount.
The increased amount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
Such reversal is recognised in the income statement.
After such a reversal the depreciation charge is adjusted in future periods to allocate the assets revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic basis over its remaining useful life.
40 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Leases Finance leases, which transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assets concerned, are capitalised on the balance sheet at the lower of fair value of the leased property and net present value of the minimum lease payments at the inception of the lease.
The corresponding liabilities are recorded as long term or current liabilities depending on the period when they are due.
The interest elements of the rental obligations are charged to the income statement over the periods of the leases as a finance cost.
Lease payments are apportioned between the finance cost and the reduction in the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over their useful life as above.
Operating leases are leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset and are not finance leases.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Cost includes all costs in bringing each product to its present location and condition, being the full manufacturing cost on a first-in-first-out basis, including all attributable overheads based on a normal level of activity and excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value represents selling price less further costs to be incurred to completion and on sale.
Trade and other receivables Trade receivables, which generally have 30 to 90 day terms, are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts.
An estimate for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable.
Bad debts are written off when identied.
Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
Provisions Provisions are recorded when the Group has a present, legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event which it is probable that the Group will be required to settle by an outow of resources and for which a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reect the current best estimate.
Where the effect of the time value of money is material, the amount of the provision shall be the present value of the expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Foreign currencies The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Companys functional and presentation currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are measured in terms of historical costs using the exchange rate at the date of the initial transactions.
The functional currencies of the Groups operations are principally US dollar, sterling or euro.
On consolidation the assets and liabilities of the Groups foreign operations are translated into the Groups presentation currency at exchange rates prevailing at the balance sheet date.
The results of foreign operations are translated into sterling using average rates.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 41 Equity investments in foreign operations include long term intra group loans, the settlement of which is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future.
Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of opening net assets of foreign investments and exchange adjustments arising from the translation of the results of foreign operations, are classied as equity and transferred to the Groups translation reserve.
Such translation differences are recognised as part of the profit or loss on disposal should an operation be disposed of.
The Group has elected to apply the exemption in IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards which allows the cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS, being 1 January 2003.
The gain or loss on the subsequent disposal of any foreign operation therefore excludes translation differences that arose before the date of transition.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at closing rates of exchange.
As permitted by IFRS 1 the Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions prior to the date of transition to IFRS as an asset of the parent, and as such these are sterling denominated.
All other exchange profits and losses are taken to the income statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide an effective hedge against the Groups equity investments in foreign operations, which are taken to equity together with the exchange differences on assets and liabilities of foreign operations.
Financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are recognised on the Groups balance sheet when it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair value of the consideration received, net of issue costs.
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
Hedge accounting is adopted where derivatives such as xed to oating interest rate swaps are held as fair value hedges against xed interest rate borrowings.
Under fair value hedge accounting, xed interest rate borrowings are revalued at each balance sheet date by the change in the fair value attributable to the interest rate risk being hedged.
Equity instruments Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Derivative financial instruments The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposures to uctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.
The Groups policy is not to undertake any trading activity in financial instruments.
Such derivative financial instruments are stated at fair value.
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.
Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is desired, the hedging relationship is documented at its inception.
This documentation identies the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration.
Such hedges are expected at inception to be highly effective.
Forward exchange contracts are used to hedge foreign exchange exposures arising on forecast receipts and payments in foreign currencies.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity proles.
Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the Groups exposure to movements in interest rates.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market rates for similar instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classied as fair value hedges when they hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability, or cash ow hedges where they hedge exposure to the variability in cash ows that is due to the risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a forecast transaction.
The Group discontinues hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the Group revokes the designation.
42 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued In relation to these fair value hedges interest rate swaps which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument is recognised in the income statement and any gain or loss on the item that is being hedged is adjusted against its carrying amount and recognised in the income statement.
In relation to cash ow hedges forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge rm commitments or highly probable forecast transactions and which meet the conditions for hedge accounting, the proportion of the gain or loss on the remeasurement of the fair value of the hedging instrument that is deemed to be effective is recognised in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
When the rm commitment or highly probable forecast transaction results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the associated gains and losses that have previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the carrying amount of the asset or liability at the time the asset or liability is recognised.
For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
Gains or losses arising on hedging instruments, which are cancelled due to termination of the underlying exposure, are taken to the income statement immediately.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts.
Pensions In the UK, the Group operates two dened benefit pension schemes for the benefit of employees.
These schemes require contributions to be made to separately administered funds, based on triennial actuarial valuations.
There is also a dened benefit scheme in Switzerland.
Other schemes are dened contribution in nature.
The cost of providing benets under the dened benefit pension schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the projected unit credit method, which attributes entitlement to benets to the current period to determine current service cost and to the current and prior periods to determine the present value of dened benefit obligations and is based on actuarial advice.
Past service costs are recognised in the income statement on a straight line basis over the vesting period or immediately if the benets have vested.
When a settlement eliminating all obligations for benets already accrued or a curtailment reducing future obligations as a result of a material reduction in the scheme membership or a reduction in future entitlement occurs the obligation and related scheme assets are remeasured using current actuarial assumptions and the resultant gain or loss recognised in the income statement during the period in which the settlement or curtailment occurs.
The interest element of the dened benefit cost represents the change in present value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time and is determined by applying the discount rate to the opening present value of the benefit obligation, taking into account material changes in the obligation during the year.
The expected return on scheme assets is based on an assessment made at the beginning of the year of long term market returns on scheme assets, adjusted for the effect on the fair value of scheme assets of contributions received and benets paid during the year.
The difference between the expected return on scheme assets and the interest cost is recognised in the income statement.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense in the period in which they occur.
The dened benefit pension asset or liability in the balance sheet comprises the total for each scheme of the present value of the dened benefit obligation using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, less any past service cost not yet recognised and less the fair value of scheme assets out of which the obligations are to be settled directly.
Fair value is based on market price information and, in the case of quoted securities, is the published bid price.
The value of a net pension benefit asset is restricted to the sum of any unrecognised past service costs and the present value of any amount the Group expects to recover by way of refunds from the scheme or reductions in the future contributions.
Contributions payable to the dened contribution schemes are charged to the income statement in the year for which they are due.
Treasury shares Spirent Communications plc shares held by the Group are classied in shareholders equity as treasury shares and are recognised at cost and shown as a deduction from retained earnings.
Consideration received for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the proceeds from sale and the original cost being taken to retained earnings.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 43 Revenue recognition Revenue is recognised when it is probable that economic benets will ow to the Group, the revenue can be reliably measured and when the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership.
In addition, revenue is only recognised when collectability is probable.
For the sale of services, revenue is recognised in accounting periods in which the service is rendered.
Revenue from maintenance contracts is recognised over the period of performance on a straight line basis.
Revenue from product sales of hardware and software is recognised at the time of delivery and acceptance and when there are no significant vendor obligations remaining.
It is not until acceptance has occurred that the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer.
Terms of acceptance are dependent upon the specic contractual arrangement agreed with the customer.
Contractual arrangements are accounted for as two or more separate transactions only where the commercial substance is that the individual components operate independently of each other because they are capable of being provided separately from one another and it is possible to attribute reliable fair values to every component.
To the extent that a separate component comprises a product sale of hardware or software, revenue is recognised as described above.
Revenue is recognised on other components as the Group fulls its contractual obligations and to the extent that it has earned the right to consideration.
Employee benets When an employee has rendered services to the Group during an accounting period, short term benets expected to be paid in exchange for those services are recognised in the same accounting period.
Share-based payment Employees including directors of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares equity-settled transactions.
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted.
The fair value is determined using a binomial model.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance conditions are fullled, ending on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled to the award vesting date.
The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reporting date, until the vesting date, reects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the number of awards that will ultimately vest, in the opinion of the directors of the Company at that date and based on the best available estimates.
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modied, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modied.
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modication, as measured at the date of modication.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately.
However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modication of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reected in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
The Group has an employee share trust for the granting of certain options to employees.
Shares in the Group held by the employee share trust are treated as treasury shares and presented in the balance sheet as a deduction from equity.
The Group took advantage of the transitional provisions of IFRS 1 in respect of equity-settled awards and has applied IFRS 2 Share-based Payment only to equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 which were unvested at 1 January 2005.
44 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 2.
Summary of significant accounting policies continued Tax Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities, based on tax rates and laws that are enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised on all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions: where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss: in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future: and deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, carried forward tax credits or tax losses can be utilised.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Income tax is charged or credited directly to equity if it relates to items that are credited or charged to equity.
Otherwise income tax is recognised in the income statement.
Critical accounting assumptions and judgements The preparation of financial statements requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect items reported.
Such estimates and assumptions are based on managements best knowledge of current facts, circumstances and future events, actual results may differ, possibly signicantly, from those estimates.
The areas requiring a high degree of judgement or where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are discussed below.
Goodwill impairment The Group tests annually by cash-generating unit whether goodwill has suffered impairment and more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the current carrying value may not be recoverable.
The recoverable amounts of cash-generating units have been determined based on value in use calculations which require the use of estimates and assumptions.
These are described in note 14.
Dened benefit pension schemes The pension cost and the dened benefit obligation of the Groups dened benefit pension schemes is based on a number of selected assumptions, these include the discount rate, ination rate, salary growth, longevity and expected return on the schemes assets.
Differences arising from actual experience or future changes in assumptions will be reected in future periods.
Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in a number of tax jurisdictions and judgement is applied in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes.
There are many transactions for which the final tax determinability is uncertain.
For example liabilities are recognised for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional taxes are likely to be due based on the facts and circumstances known at the time the financial statements are prepared.
Where the final outcome differs from the amounts that were initially recorded the differences will be recorded in the future period in which the determination is made.
Deferred taxes The extent to which deferred tax assets can be recognised is based on current forecasts and estimates prepared by management.
A change to these forecasts and estimates could result in a different recognition outcome.
Provisions The Group records a provision for vacant property based on future rentals and reduced by its expected ability to sublease the vacant space to a third party and discounted where the effect is significant.
Changes in the actual outcome compared with expected outcome on subleasing or changes to expectations will be recorded in future periods.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 45 New standards and interpretations not applied During the year, the IASB and IFRIC have issued the following standards and interpretations with an effective date for the Group after the date of these financial statements: International Accounting Standards IAS IFRS Effective date IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007 IAS 1 Amendment Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007 IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009 IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 1 January 2007 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of embedded derivatives 1 January 2007 IFRIC 10 Interim Financial Reporting and Impairment 1 January 2007 IFRIC 11 IFRS 2 Group and Treasury Share Transactions 1 January 2008 IFRIC 12 Service Concession Arrangements 1 January 2008 The directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the Groups financial statements in the period of initial application.
Upon adoption of IFRS 7, the Group will have to disclose additional information about its financial instruments, their signicance and the nature and extent of risks that they give rise to.
More specically, the Group will need to disclose the fair value of its financial instruments and its risk exposure in greater detail.
There will be no effect on reported income or net assets.
Upon adoption of IFRIC 8, the Group will be required under IFRS 2 to disclose any arrangements where equity instruments are issued for consideration which appears to be less than fair value.
Revenue 2006 2005 million million Sales of goods 235.5 228.8 Maintenance and support services 36.1 30.5 Total revenue from continuing operations 271.6 259.3 Revenues for discontinued operations principally relate to sales of goods.
Segmental analysis The Groups primary reporting format is business segments and its secondary format is geographical segments.
Business segments For management purposes, the Group is currently organised on a worldwide basis into two operating groups, Communications and Systems.
Communications is further subdivided into two divisions Performance Analysis and Service Assurance.
The Network Products group was disposed of during the current reporting period and, as described in note 6, this group together with the investment in associated companies HellermannTyton Division has been classied as a discontinued operation.
The remaining three operating segments are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment information.
The principal activities of each segment are as follows: Performance Analysis division of the Communications group develops testing solutions for a broad range of Communications technologies critical to the development of next-generation network equipment and devices: Service Assurance division of the Communications group provides network monitoring and management systems for service providers to assure the quality of their high bandwidth data services.
Sales include hardware and software products as well as maintenance and support services: and Systems group comprises PG Drives Technology, which develops power control systems for specialist electrical vehicles in the mobility and industrial markets.

Pensions Dened benefit schemes The significant dened benefit pension schemes are in the United Kingdom and comprise the Staff Pension Plan and the Retirement Cash Plan.
These schemes have been combined for the purposes of the following disclosures.
There is a less significant scheme in Switzerland which is disclosed separately.
The assets and liabilities on the balance sheet are as follows: 2006 2005 million million Assets UK dened benefit pension plan surplus 2.4 Liabilities UK dened benefit plan deficit 50.8 UK unfunded plan 0.7 0.7 Overseas dened benefit plan deficit 0.7 Dened benefit pension plan deficit 1.4 51.5 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 55 UK dened benefit pension schemes The most recent actuarial valuation of schemes assets and the present value of the dened benefit schemes obligations using the projected unit credit method at 1 April 2003 have been used and updated by our independent actuaries.
The triennial actuarial valuations of the schemes at 1 April 2006 are currently in progress.

The mortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables which allow for future mortality improvements.
The assumptions used imply that a member who retires in 2026 at age 65 will live on average for a further 22 years after retirement if they are male and for a further 24 years after retirement if they are female.

The directors are unable to determine how much of the pension scheme deficit recognised on 1 January 2003 and taken directly to equity of 41.9 million in the Group is attributable to actuarial gains and losses since inception of those pension schemes.
Consequently, the directors are unable to determine the amount of actuarial gains and losses that would have been recognised in the Groups statement of recognised income and expense before 1 January 2003. v Movements in the present value of dened benefit obligations 2006 2005 million million At 1 January 179.6 144.2 Current service cost 1.0 2.0 Interest cost 8.0 7.6 Employee contributions 0.3 0.6 benefit payments 6.8 5.5 Transfer values paid 20.1 Curtailment gains 1.7 Settlement gains 0.5 Actuarial gain loss 1.6 30.7 Present value of dened benefit pension schemes obligations 158.2 179.6 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 57 vi Movements in the fair value of schemes assets 2006 2005 million million At 1 January 128.8 106.9 Expected return on schemes assets 10.0 6.5 Employer contributions 47.9 5.7 Employee contributions 0.3 0.6 benefit payments 6.8 5.5 Transfer values paid 20.1 Actuarial gain loss 0.5 14.6 Fair value of schemes assets 160.6 128.8 vii History of experience gains and losses 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 million million million million million Present value of dened benefit pension schemes obligations 158.2 179.6 144.2 142.2 130.9 Fair value of schemes assets 160.6 128.8 106.9 98.8 89.0 Net surplus deficit in schemes 2.4 50.8 37.3 43.4 41.9 Experience gains and losses on schemes liabilities Amount million 10.0 4.8 2.4 6.8 0.9 Percentage of schemes liabilities % 6.3 2.7 1.7 4.8 0.7 Experience gains and losses on schemes assets Amount million 0.5 14.6 3.6 6.6 20.3 Percentage of schemes assets % 0.3 11.3 3.4 6.7 22.8 The above schemes are funded and have full UK HM Revenue & Customs tax-exempt approval.
Certain members, whose salaries were in excess of the statutory earnings cap, had their benets increased through unapproved, unfunded arrangements, to the level that would otherwise have applied in respect of the basic salary only.
The Group has contractually agreed to pay the additional retirement benets itself and a provision is made in respect of this obligation in the balance sheet at 31 December 2006 of 0.7 million 2005 0.7 million.
This represents the actuarial value as confirmed by the Groups pension advisers, of the unapproved benefit entitlements accrued at that date.
The value is assessed and reviewed on a Market Value basis in line with the Main Plan Valuation and adjusted each year by the charge for the year equivalent to a contribution to a funded scheme of nil 2005 0.1 million and interest of nil on the unfunded liability 2005 nil.
Expected contributions for these schemes for 2007 are 0.3 million.
The Group contributed 47.0 million to the Spirent Staff Pension Plan in February 2006 from the proceeds of the sale of the HellermannTyton Division.
Curtailment and settlement gains arose during 2006 on: the disposal of the HellermannTyton Division: and an offer made to active and deferred members of the Spirent Staff Pension Plan to leave the Plan and take an enhanced transfer value to another pension arrangement.
A significant number of members accepted the offer.
The gains have been calculated based on those members who had committed to the transfer by 31 December 2006.

Performance Analysis is a reportable segment and SwissQual is a business unit which is included within Performance Analysis.
Service Assurance Broadband is a business unit within the Service Assurance reportable segment.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives which are on average five years and the charge is included within administration expenses in the income statement.
The remaining amortisation period of the intangible asset balances arising in relation to customer list and current technology are 4.1 years and 4.2 years, respectively.
Impairment of Service Assurance Broadband in the first half of 2006 IAS 36 Impairment of Assets requires that a cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated should be tested whenever there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
As a result of a decline in revenues from some of the units existing products experienced in the first half of 2006 and the delay to expectations in securing orders for the new IP products and services, this unit was tested for impairment in June 2006.
The recoverable amount of this unit was determined based on a value in use calculation using a pre-tax discount rate of 21.2 per cent.
Following the impairment test, a goodwill impairment charge of 9.5 million was recognised through administration expenses in the first half of 2006.
Annual impairment test The recoverable amounts of these cash-generating units at 30 November 2006, the annual impairment testing date, have been calculated based on a value in use calculation using cash ow projections over a three year period.
These were based on financial budgets approved by the Board for the next year and on approved strategic plans for the following two years.
Cash ows in subsequent years have been extrapolated using a 2.5 per cent growth rate which approximates to the average long term growth rate for the industries in which these units operate.
Further impairment of Service Assurance Broadband Increased uncertainty in the second half of 2006 in relation to expectations in securing orders for the new IP products and services and revisions to three year cash ow projections arising from organisational changes and a re-evaluation of the cost structure have resulted in a further impairment charge of 9.6 million in the second half year, giving a total charge of 19.1 million recognised through administration expenses in the full year.
As a result the goodwill in the Service Assurance Broadband unit is fully impaired at 31 December 2006.
For the annual impairment test the recoverable amount of this unit was determined based on a value in use calculation using a pre-tax discount rate of 22.2 per cent 2005 17.2 per cent.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 65 Impairment of SwissQual SwissQual was acquired by the Group on 23 January 2006.
Activity levels experienced in SwissQual were much lower in 2006 compared with expectations at the time the business was acquired, in part due to delays in the launch of new products.
The recoverable amount of this unit at 30 November 2006 was determined based on a value in use calculation using a pre-tax discount rate of 22.0 per cent.
Following the impairment test, a goodwill impairment charge of 27.7 million was recognised through administration expenses.
As a result the goodwill arising on acquisition is fully impaired at 31 December 2006.
Performance Analysis excluding SwissQual For the Performance Analysis excluding SwissQual unit the cash ows were discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 21.8 per cent 2005 15.9 per cent.
The recoverable amount of this unit, calculated on a value in use basis, was in excess of its carrying value and consequently no impairment has been recognised.
Key assumptions for the annual impairment test The key assumptions in these value in use calculations were: Revenue growth rates used in the budget and strategic plans.
Growth rate used to extrapolate cash ows beyond the strategic plan period.
Revenue growth rates used in the budget and strategic plans are based on managements estimate of growth in the markets served, taking into account products yet to be launched and which are in the development pipeline.
They are consistent with external sources of information including comparable companies operating in the same markets and analysts forecasts.
Gross margins are based on historical values achieved by the respective cash-generating units.
Operating expenses are based upon historical levels suitably adjusted for changes in activity levels and organisational structure over the term of the cash ow projections.
The discount rates are based on the Groups weighted average cost of capital adjusted to reect managements estimate of the specic risk prole associated with the cash ow projections for each cash-generating unit.
Long term growth rates are based upon industry analysis and are consistent with analysts forecasts.
Sensitivity to changes in key assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use for the Performance Analysis excluding SwissQual cash-generating unit outlined above, management believes that no reasonable possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of a unit to exceed its recoverable amount.
For both the Service Assurance Broadband unit and SwissQual the goodwill has been fully impaired as a result of the impairments taken in 2006.
Any adverse change in the key assumptions would, however, cause a further impairment loss to be recognised.

These assets can only be realised when they reverse against suitable taxable profits.
Although the directors ultimately expect to realise these assets, there is currently insufficient evidence under IAS 12 Income Taxes to recognise a deferred tax asset in respect of these temporary differences.
In addition, the Group has tax losses arising in the US of 42.2 million 2005 79.6 million and in the UK of 72.7 million 2005 42.2 million that are available for offset against future taxable profits.

US tax losses can be carried forward for 20 years and UK losses can be carried forward indefinitely.
In total deferred tax assets amounting to 67.1 million 2005 76.0 million have not been recognised on unutilised losses and temporary differences.
In 2005 0.1 million of deferred tax was recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates.

Financial risk management The Groups principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise trade receivables, trade payables, cash, short term deposits and short dated commercial paper.
The main purpose of these financial instruments, other than trade receivables and trade payables, is to fund the Groups liquidity requirements.
The Group enters into derivative transactions, principally forward foreign exchange contracts, for the management of the Groups currency risks and other exposures when deemed appropriate.
The key objective of the Group Treasury department is to manage the financial risks of the business and to ensure that sufficient liquidity is available to the Group.
All treasury activity operates within a formal control framework.
The Board has approved treasury policies and guidelines and periodically reviews treasury activities.
Additionally, it is the Groups policy that speculative treasury transactions are expressly forbidden.
Interest rate risk The Group has limited exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates following repayment of its long term debt obligations in February 2006.
The Groups excess funds are held in the United Kingdom and United States and invested in short term deposits or short dated commercial paper.
Foreign currency risk Currency exposures arise from trading transactions undertaken by the Group in foreign currencies and on the translation of the operating results and net assets of overseas subsidiaries.
As a result of the Group having significant operations in the United States, its results can be affected signicantly by movements in the US dollar exchange rate.
During the year, sterling strengthened against the US dollar.
Group Treasury, by means of forward foreign exchange contracts, carries out the majority of the transaction hedging activity in relation to normal trading activity.
The Group does not enter into instruments to hedge the translation exposure of the operating results or net assets of its overseas subsidiaries since these are accounting and not cash exposures.
Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk at 31 December 2006.
The Group has implemented policies that require appropriate credit checks on potential customers before sales commence and no one customer accounts for more than 10 per cent of total Group revenues.
All financial instruments are transacted with commercial banks.
Financial instrument counterparties are subject to pre-approval by the Group Audit Committee and such approval is limited to financial institutions with a rating of Standard & Poors A or Moodys A-2 or better.
The amount of exposure to any individual counterparty is subject to a limit.
Liquidity risk The Groups objective is to ensure that there are sufficient sources of funding to meet projected requirements.
Its operations are nanced through cash and cash equivalents held centrally and cash generated from operations.
The Group had cash and cash equivalents of 97.6 million at 31 December 2006.
The Group currently has no borrowing facilities in place.

d Derivative financial instruments The fair value of the derivative financial instruments at 31 December is as follows: 2006 2005 million million Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Interest rate swaps expected to be realised in more than one year 2.0 Currency derivatives expected to be realised in less than one year 0.1 2.6 0.7 0.1 2.6 2.7 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 77 The derivative financial instruments are as follows: Interest rate swaps Fixed to oating interest rate swaps were in place at 31 December 2005 to hedge $72.1 million of the senior unsecured loan notes outstanding at that time.
The interest rate swaps were designated as hedges and were included in the balance sheet as derivative financial instruments non-current liabilities at their fair value with movements in fair value being reected through the income statement.
These swaps were terminated on 15 February 2006 at which point all gains and losses were recognised in the income statement together with a break fee due on early termination of 2.3 million.
Currency derivatives The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts in the management of transactional exchange rate exposures.
These contracts are designated where possible as hedging instruments.
At 31 December 2006 the Group held various foreign exchange contracts in respect of the forward sale of US dollars and euro on trading transactions.
These contracts total 8.8 million, are for various maturity dates over the period to December 2007 and are at exchange rates in the range 1.86 to 1.95 for US dollar contracts and 1.47 for euro contracts.
These contracts have not been designated as hedges.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entities As at 31 December 2005 senior unsecured loan notes of $124.8 million were designated as a hedge of the net investments in the United States and were used to reduce the exposure of the foreign exchange risk.
Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing were transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation of the net investments in subsidiaries.
As previously stated the loan notes were repaid in February 2006 and as such the Group does not have at 31 December 2006 hedges of this nature in place.
Operating lease commitments At 31 December, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, which fall due as follows: 2006 2005 million million Continuing operations Within one year 7.7 7.6 In the second to fifth years 17.4 17.1 Over five years 5.2 5.4 30.3 30.1 Discontinued operations Within one year 1.6 In the second to fifth years 4.2 Over five years 9.0 14.8 30.3 44.9 The Group leases certain land and buildings under non-cancellable operating lease agreements with a variety of terms.

6 The Ordinary shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count towards ABI scheme limits.
7 This includes stock appreciation rights awarded under the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan, the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan and the Netcom Stock Appreciation Rights Plan, which is fully hedged by market purchased shares in the ESOT see note k below for further details on this plan.
8 Performance shares awarded under the EIP see note b below for further details on the EIP have been made in the form of conditional share awards.
Description of employee share schemes a 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The ESOS is now closed however outstanding options may still be exercised and has been replaced by the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan referred to in b below.
Awards under the ESOS, normally determined annually, were at the sole discretion of the Remuneration Committee after considering recommendations made to it by the Chief Executive.
No price was payable on the grant of an option and no options were granted at a discount to the market price.
The normal exercise period for options granted under the ESOS is between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
Options awarded under the ESOS are subject to the achievement of an earnings per share EPS performance condition before they can be exercised.
The condition is that over a period of three consecutive financial years, there has been an increase in the Companys adjusted EPS which is at least 6 per cent more than the increase in the Retail Price Index over the same period.
The performance condition is tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if it has not been met at that time, at each subsequent anniversary of grant until the option expires ie on the tenth anniversary of grant in normal circumstances.
82 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32.
Authorised and issued share capital continued All ESOS grants made after 11 May 2000 to executive directors are subject to enhanced performance conditions.
The performance condition requires the Companys adjusted EPS to increase over a period of three consecutive financial years within a range of 9 per cent minimum performance for 25 per cent option vesting and 15 per cent for 100 per cent option vesting, with a sliding scale between these points.
In addition, performance testing over the ten year option term is measured from a base point xed at the date of grant.
Performance will be tested on the third anniversary of grant and, if the target conditions at that time have not yet been met in full, performance will be tested again on the fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant only, with the performance hurdle being increased in proportion to the extended period.
b 2005 Employee Incentive Plan EIP On 4 May 2005, Spirent shareholders approved the EIP to replace the now closed ESOS.
The EIP is currently available for selected employees including executive directors on a similar discretionary basis as the ESOS.
No price is payable on the grant of an award and no award has been granted at a discount to the market price.
The Company is able to grant share options, including HMRC approved options, share settled stock appreciation rights SARs and performance shares under the EIP.
In normal circumstances, options or SARs under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys EPS growth targets after excluding ination have been met over a three year performance period.
The growth targets in respect of the initial award require that the Companys EPS increases within a range of 6 per cent per annum for 25 per cent vesting and 15 per cent per annum for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
In normal circumstances, performance shares under the EIP will vest three years following grant provided the Companys total shareholder return TSR targets have been met over a three year performance period.
The performance condition requires Spirents TSR to be between the median of a comparator group for 30 per cent vesting and the upper quartile of a comparator group for 100 per cent vesting over the performance period, with a sliding scale between these points.
The comparator group consists of the 30 largest companies by market capitalisation in the FTSE TechMARK 100 Index, excluding those TechMARK companies who are also constituents of the FTSE100 Index at the commencement of the performance period.
All EIP awards will be tested once on or shortly following the third anniversary of grant.
Any part of an award which does not vest shall lapse and there is no opportunity for retesting.
SARs granted under the EIP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in market value of an Ordinary share over the base price of the SAR in the form of new issue Ordinary shares.
This SARs approach, which is also being utilised for the Spirent Stock Incentive Plan see note c below, will help the Company manage its dilution headroom more efficiently as only the SAR gain and not the entire share value needs to be funded.
Using a SARs based approach, it is not possible to determine the precise level of dilution until the SARs are exercised.
4.6 million EIP SARs with an average base price of 50 pence were outstanding as at 31 December 2006.
No EIP SARs have been exercised to date.
Options and SARs granted under the EIP expire on the tenth anniversary of their grant unless they have previously lapsed or been exercised.
c Spirent Stock Incentive Plan SSIP The SSIP was introduced in 2000.
This discretionary plan is primarily targeted at selected employees in the Communications group with grants normally determined annually by reference to the seniority and contribution of the individual, together with the performance of the relevant business and prevailing local market practice.
Under the SSIP, grants are also permitted to selected newly hired and promoted employees on a monthly basis.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held in June 2004, shareholders approved the renewal of the SSIP until the Companys 2007 Annual General Meeting along with several amendments including the ability to award SARs as well as stock options.
The current shareholder approved mandate regarding annual dilution rates includes an annual allowance of 2.5 per cent of shares outstanding for the SSIP and 0.6 per cent of shares outstanding for the EIP see b above.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 83 27.8 million SSIP SARs with an average base price of 55 pence were outstanding as at 31 December 2006.
During 2006, 22,928 Ordinary shares were issued as a consequence of the exercise of 216,315 SSIP SARs.
Awards made pursuant to the SSIP normally vest over four years, provided that the employee remains in employment.
Awards normally become 25 per cent exercisable on the first anniversary of the date of grant and thereafter in equal proportions on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Any award not exercised by the seventh anniversary of grant will lapse.
No price is payable on the grant of options or SARs and no options or SARs have been, or can be, granted at a discount to the market price.
d Netcom Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan NARSOP Spirent completed the acquisition of Netcom Systems, Inc. Netcom in 1999.
$44.5 million of the total consideration was satisfied through the roll-over of outstanding options over Netcom shares, into options over approximately 23.8 million Ordinary shares as adjusted on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
All remaining outstanding options are fully vested and exercisable until they expire.
e Zarak Amended and Restated Stock Option Plan ZARSOP Out of a total consideration of approximately 44.9 million Ordinary shares issued for the acquisition of Zarak Systems Corporation Zarak in 2000, approximately 3.8 million shares arose in connection with the roll-over of outstanding options over Zarak shares into options over Spirent Ordinary shares on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
These options have either a five or ten year life from the original date of grant.
Unvested rolled-over options were capable of immediate exercise ie prior to their respective vesting date and any shares arising from such an event were held in the ESOT until the relevant vesting date.
The option holder was entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they were held in trust but they remained subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment was terminated prior to the vesting date.
All ZARSOP options and resulting shares held in the ESOT have now fully vested.
f Caw Amended and Restated Stock Plan CARSP Out of a total initial consideration for the acquisition of Caw Networks, Inc. Caw in 2002 of $49 million, approximately $4 million was in respect of Spirent Ordinary shares and options which arose on the roll-over of outstanding options and shares under the previous Caw employee stock plan.
The options and shares would vest over a period ending in 2006 on substantially similar terms as previously existed.
The options have a ten year life from the original date of grant.
Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement for Caw, an additional cash payment of 78.8 US cents was payable as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
The option holder was entitled to the beneficial but not legal interest in the shares whilst they were held in the ESOT but they remained subject to forfeiture with the original option exercise prices being refunded to the participant if the participants employment was terminated prior to the vesting date.
All CARSP options and resulting shares held in the ESOT have now fully vested.
In accordance with the original terms for acquiring Caw, in March 2004, Spirent allotted 4.3 million Ordinary shares and issued 75,000 options following the achievement by Caw of certain technical and financial earn out targets.
Participation in the CARSP entitled the participants to a share in the earn out.
Any earn out payment for an outstanding CARSP option was made by increasing the number of shares subject to the option and decreasing the per share exercise price so as to preserve the existing aggregate total exercise price.
Of the 4.3 million shares, 54,000 shares were issued to the ESOT in respect of unvested restricted shares, which remained subject to forfeiture prior to vesting.
As a result of the earn out, the additional cash payment referred to above was adjusted to 66.9 US cents as each share vested or upon the exercise of a vested option.
The Ordinary shares subject to rolled-over options from the acquisition of Netcom, Zarak and Caw, or granted under the SSIP, do not count towards ABI scheme limits.
The plans mentioned in a and d to f above are closed to new entrants and no further awards of options can be made under them.
84 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 32.
Authorised and issued share capital continued g UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS and the 2005 Sharesave Scheme The SRSOS closed in 2005 and was replaced by the 2005 Sharesave Scheme.
SRSOS options which remain outstanding may still be exercised prior to expiry, however no further grants can be made.
Both schemes operate as HMRC approved Save-As-You-Earn schemes and are open to all UK employees, subject to a qualifying service period.
Any future sharesave invitations will be made under the 2005 Sharesave Scheme, which is broadly similar to the SRSOS.
The employee enters into a Save-As-You-Earn contract with the Companys savings carrier to save a regular sum of between 5 and 250 per month for a xed period of either three or five years.
No price is payable on the grant of an option.
The option exercise price is calculated by reference to the middle market price of an Ordinary share on the business day prior to the beginning of the invitation period, discounted by up to 20 per cent, at the Boards discretion.
Options are normally exercisable within six months of the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the contract commencement date, as elected by the option holder at the start of the contract.
The Company operates the SST to honour the commitment to deliver Ordinary shares against the exercise of outstanding options under the SRSOS.
Spirent Sharesave Trust Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Spirent Communications plc, acts as sole trustee of the SST.
During the year, 1.4 million Ordinary shares were transferred to participants.
No invitations have been made under either UK Sharesave Schemes since 2003. h US Employee Stock Purchase Plan ESPP The ESPP enables the Company to grant eligible US employees the right to acquire Spirent American Depositary Shares using proceeds of a savings contract.
When joining the ESPP, participants enter into a contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of $1,000 net per month, over a contract period of 12 months by way of regular payroll deductions.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003. i Global All Employee Share Purchase Plan GAESPP The GAESPP was approved by shareholders in 2001 and offers employees in countries other than the UK or US an opportunity to share in the Companys performance through share ownership.
The GAESPP was implemented in Canada in January 2002 and operates on similar terms to the ESPP above, with participants entering into a 12 month contract to save up to 15 per cent of basic salary gross, subject to an individual maximum of Cdn $1,000 net per month.
No offer has been made under this plan since 2003. j UK Employee Share Purchase Plan UK ESPP On 4 May 2005, shareholders approved the UK ESPP, which is based on an HMRC approved share incentive plan, available to all UK employees subject to a qualifying service period.
The UK ESPP offers three ways to provide Ordinary shares to employees: free shares, partnership shares and matching shares.
The UK ESPP will operate in conjunction with a trust, which will hold the shares on the behalf of participants.
Each year awards of free shares may be made to eligible employees up to a value of 3,000.
Awards may be made subject to performance targets determined by the directors.
In normal circumstances, free shares must be held in trust for between three and five years and normally become free of income tax and national insurance if held for five years.
Employees may be offered the opportunity to purchase partnership shares out of monthly contributions taken from pre-tax salary up to 1,500 or 10 per cent of salary, if less.
The directors determine an accumulation period of between one and 12 months following which the shares are purchased.
Where the savings period is longer than one month, the purchase price will be the lesser of the price at the beginning of the accumulation period or the price at the end.
Participants can withdraw partnership shares from the trust at anytime, however, doing so before five years may trigger a tax liability.
Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 85 If partnership shares have been offered to employees, the Company may also offer matching shares up to a maximum of two matching shares for each partnership share.
In normal circumstances, matching shares must be held in trust for a period of at least three years and may be subject to forfeiture if the participant leaves employment prior to the end of this period.
No awards have been made so far under this plan.
k Stock Appreciation Rights Plan SARP The SARP was introduced in September 1999 as an interim incentive arrangement for the employees of Netcom following the closure of the NARSOP described in d above and subsequently for certain other employees in the Communications group.
Under the SARP, recruitment, promotion and recognition awards over Ordinary shares have been made in line with historic and local market practice.
The operation of the SARP reected as far as practicable the NARSOP.
Accordingly, rights under the SARP vested over four years, 25 per cent vesting one year after the date of grant and the remainder vesting on a monthly basis over a further 36 months.
Rights granted were not subject to the fullment of any performance conditions.
The SARP will deliver the appreciation value ie the aggregated increase in the market value of an Ordinary share over the rights price in the form of existing Ordinary shares which have been purchased in the market by the Companys ESOT.
The SARP is closed and no further grants can be made under it.
At 31 December 2006, the following rights were outstanding under the SARP: Number of rights Rights price outstanding Rights exercise dates pence million 10.09.00-29.06.10 182-400 2.0 33.
Share-based payment The total charge for the year relating to employee share-based payment plans is as follows: 2006 2005 million million Continuing operations 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.1 0.4 2005 Employee Incentive Plan 0.4 0.1 Spirent Stock Incentive Plan 4.6 4.4 Acquisition Plans 0.2 Employee Sharesave Schemes 0.1 5.2 5.1 Discontinued operations 1995 Executive Share Option Scheme 0.4 0.4 Employee Sharesave Schemes 0.1 0.4 0.5 5.6 5.6 86 Spirent Communications plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33.
Share-based payment continued The fair value of the options and purchase rights over Ordinary shares is estimated as at the date of grant using a binomial model.
The following table gives the assumptions made in arriving at the share-based payments charge: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price pence 45 53 Weighted average fair value pence 23 24 Expected volatility % 40-50 50-55 Expected life years 4.5 4.5 Risk free rate % 4.7-5.1 4.2 Dividend yield % nil nil-1.0 The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Companys share price over the previous two years which management considers to be the period which is likely to be most representative of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
For performance shares granted under the 2005 Employee Incentive Plan, which have a market based performance condition, it has been assumed that there will be 50 per cent vesting for valuation purposes.

The nature and purpose of each reserve within equity is as follows: i Share premium account: this reserve records the consideration premium for shares issued at a value that exceeds their nominal value: ii Capital reserve: this reserve arises in relation to share option plans in acquired companies: iii Translation reserve: this reserve is used to record exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries.
It is also used to record foreign exchange arising on the net investments hedged in these subsidiaries: and iv Net unrealised gains and losses: this reserve records movements in fair value of effective forward currency contracts accounted for using hedge accounting.
Investment in own shares At 31 December 2006, an amount of 43.9 million 2005 2.6 million is deducted from retained earnings in relation to the cost of investment in own shares.
These shares include shares held in trust and treasury shares.
Shares held in trust relates to 1.9 million Ordinary shares 2005 3.2 million held by the Spirent Sharesave Trust SST and 9.7 million Ordinary shares 2005 9.4 million held by the Spirent Employee Share Ownership Trust ESOT.
Shares held by the SST will be used to satisfy options under the Companys Savings Related Share Option Schemes.
Shares held in the ESOT are primarily held to hedge awards under various discretionary employee share schemes.
The market value of own shares held in trust at 31 December 2006 was 6.6 million 2005 6.2 million.
At 31 December 2006 the Company held 90.3 million Ordinary shares in treasury 2005 nil.
The market value of own shares held in treasury at 31 December 2006 was 51.2 million 2005 nil.
Cancellation of share premium and capital redemption reserves On 24 November 2004, Spirent Communications plc was granted an order of the High Court for the approval of the cancellation of the share premium account and capital redemption reserve the Cancellation which stood at that date at 702.7 million and 0.7 million, respectively.
The Cancellation created a reserve in the financial statements of the Company which was applied to eliminate the deficit in distributable reserves.
The balance of this reserve, created after the deficit in distributable reserves had been eliminated, was transferred to a special nondistributable reserve.
The special non-distributable reserve at 31 December 2005 was 11.1 million.
During 2006 the Company transferred funds equal to the aggregate amount due to any creditors of Spirent Communications plc, who were creditors on 24 November 2004, and who still remained creditors, to a blocked trust account.
Placing these funds in a blocked trust account in accordance with the undertakings made at the time of the Cancellation allowed the special reserve to be released to distributable reserves.
