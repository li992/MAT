These financial statements do not reflect this dividend payable.
Contingent liabilities The group has provided guarantees at 30 April 2006 in respect of free trade customers' bank borrowings - total guarantee of 6.4m.
Transition to IFRS The group has prepared financial statements which comply with International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS applicable for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
In preparing these, the group started from an opening balance sheet as at 3 May 2004, the group's date of transition, and made changes in accounting policies and other restatements required by IFRS 1 for the first time adoption of IFRS.
This note explains the pricipal adjustments made by the group in its restatement of the 3 May 2004 UK GAAP balance sheet, and the previously published UK GAAP financial statements for the year ended 1 May 2005.
IFRS 1 First time adoption choices IFRS 1 First time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards grants companies adopting IFRS for the first time limited transitional exemptions from the full requirements of IFRS.
Set out below is a description of the significant first time adoption choices made by the group: Business combinations Business combinations that took place before the date of transition have not been restated under IFRS.
As a result, goodwill arising from past business combinations remains as stated under UK GAAP at 3 May 2004.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2005 06 52 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 30 APRIL 2006 Employee benefits The pension liability in relation to employee defined benefit schemes has been recognised in full in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Valuation of properties The revalued amount of properties at 3 May 2004 is treated as deemed cost as at that date.
Share-based payments IFRS 2 is applied only to share based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested on or before 1 January 2005.
Financial instruments IAS 32 and IAS 39 have been applied to the financial year commencing 2 May 2005.
Financial instruments are accounted for under UK GAAP in the 2004 05 income statement and balance sheet.
Areas of impact The significant changes from the adoption of IFRS are described below.
Numbering relates to the adjustments shown on the reconciliations that follow.
'Other' adjustments relate to reclassifications of trade loans to other financial assets, the revaluation reserve into retained earnings and the dividend paid in the period from the income statement to retained earnings.
1 IAS 17 - Leases Under UK GAAP fair values attached to leasehold interests acquired as part of an acquisition were held within fixed assets and depreciated over the life of the lease.
Under IFRS, these amounts represent a prepayment of rent and are held as current assets and amortised over the term of the lease.
Impact: Reclassification required between fixed assets and prepayments - 4.0m at 3 May 2004, and 9.2m at 1 May 2005.
No net income impact 0.8m of depreciation is reclassified as rent in the year ended 1 May 2005.
6.0m of the adjustment at 1 May 2005 relates to leases acquired with the Laurel acquisition, therefore fixed assets acquired has decreased by 6.0m and prepayments increased by 6.0m from those reported under UK GAAP.
There is no net impact on goodwill from this adjustment.
2a IAS 19 - Employee benefits - post-employment pension benefits Under UK GAAP SSAP24 Accounting for Pension Costs pension costs are charged to the profit and loss account over the average expected service life of current employees.
Variations from regular cost are spread over the expected remaining service lives of current employees.
Any differences between the amount charged to the profit and loss and payments made to the schemes are treated as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet.
IAS 19 requires recognition of the operating and finance costs of defined benefit plans in the income statement.
Recognition of actuarial gains and losses through equity is allowed when they occur.
Impact: Pension deficit of 43.6m recognised in non-current liabilities with related deferred tax asset of 13.1m netted off deferred tax liabilities at 3 May 2004.
At 1 May 2005 the pension liability was 50.2m.
9.0m of actuarial losses has been recognised directly in equity.
Profit before tax increased by 2.4m, made up of 3.1m reversal of SSAP 24 past service costs and 0.7m interest charge, with related tax charge of 0.8m for the financial year ended 1 May 2005.
2b IAS 19 - Employee benefits - other post-employment benefits Under UK GAAP FRS 12 Provisions and contingent liabilities, liabilities for other post employment benefits are provided when there is a future liability for a past event that is reliably measurable.
Under IFRS, all post-employment benefits are captured by IAS 19.
The cost of any past service should be measured and discounted using bond yields.
Impact: Increase in provision of 2.0m and decrease in deferred tax provision of 1.5m at 3 May 2004.
There was no net movement in the liability as at 1 May 2005 and no net impact on the income statement due to offset of reversal of costs booked under UK GAAP and additional finance costs on the liability.
2c IAS 19 - Employee benefits - short term benefits IAS 19 specifically requires any difference between amounts due to employees and amounts recognised through the income statement in relation to short-term employee benefits to be recognised on the balance sheet.
There is no equivalent standard under UK GAAP.
Impact: Liability recognised relating to holiday due but not taken, 0.5m at 3 May 2004 and 0.7m at 1 May 2005, the impact on the income statement being 0.2m.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2005 06 53 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 30 APRIL 2006 3 IFRS 2 - Share based payments Under UK GAAP, the group was required to recognise the cost of options under specific schemes, based on the intrinsic value of the option at the date of grant, spread over the vesting period, or performance period, where performance criteria must be satisfied, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Under IFRS, the fair value of employee services received is measured by reference to the fair value of the equity instrument at the grant date, with the charge spread over the vesting period for all grants, except for those occurring before 7 November 2002.
Exemption for SAYE schemes is no longer available.
Impact: Net debit of 0.2m in equity at 3 May 2004, made up of an IFRS 2 charge of 0.5m less 0.3m previously booked under UK GAAP.
Associated increase to deferred tax asset of 0.2m.
Additional deferred tax asset of 1.2m recognised in relation to pre-November 2002 options which had not vested before 1 January 2005.
Net debit of 0.5m recognised in the income statement for the year ended 1 May 2005, made up of an IFRS 2 charge of 1.2m less 0.7m previously booked under UK GAAP.
Associated deferred tax credit of 0.2m also recognised in the income statement.
Additional deferred tax asset of 0.3m recognised directly in equity in relation to pre-November 2002 options.
4 IAS 12 - Income taxes In addition to the adjustments to deferred tax noted in connection with the other areas of impact, further adjustments relating to the implementation of IAS 12 are outlined below: Under UK GAAP deferred tax was provided on roll-over relief claims only to the extent that the liability was expected to crystallise.
Under IFRS, a provision is required for all such claims, net of capital losses.
Under UK GAAP, the creation of a deferred tax liability for revaluation gains was not permitted, under IFRS it is required.
The last valuation was performed in 2003 04.
The revalued carrying amounts at 3 May 2004 will form the deemed costs under IFRS.
Impact: Deferred tax liability recognised for rolled-over gains was 6.1m at 3 May 2004 and 9.3m at 1 May 2005.
Deferred tax liability recognised for revaluation gains was 18.9m at 3 May 2004 and 107.3m at 1 May 2005.
87.6m of the liability at 1 May 2005 was attributable to the properties acquired with the Laurel acquisition and therefore increases the goodwill on acquisition to 246.9m from the 159.3m reported under UK GAAP.
5 IAS 10 - Events after balance sheet date Under UK GAAP, interim and final proposed dividends have been recorded in the financial year to which they related and are recognised as a liability at the relevant balance sheet date.
Under IFRS, dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability.
Impact: Reversal of the proposed dividend liability increases equity by 16.9m at 3 May 2004, and 18.8m at 1 May 2005.
Net increase in profit of 1.9m.
6 IAS 18 - Revenue Under UK GAAP, revenue is stated at gross sales value less VAT and discounts.
Under IFRS, the definition is tightened to exclude all taxes collected on behalf of third parties.
Impact: Reclassification of 25.1m from revenue to operating costs related to duty payable on the sale of own-brewed products to external customers.
No impact on trading profit.
GREENE KING ANNUAL REPORT 2005 06 54 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS ENDED 30 APRIL 2006 7 IFRS 3 - Business combinations Under UK GAAP, goodwill was amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of 20 years.
Under IFRS, positive goodwill must not be amortised, but must be held at cost less impairment losses, and tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred.
Negative goodwill is recognised in the income statement immediately.
Amortisation prior to the date of transition is not reversed, the carrying value of 113.1m at 3 May 2004 is frozen.
Impact: Increase in profit before tax and the goodwill asset of 13.1m.
