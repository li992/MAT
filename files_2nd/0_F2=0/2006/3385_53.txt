EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS This is the first year that the Group has presented its consolidated financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 October 2005.
As the date for transition to IFRS was 1 November 2004, comparative financial information presented in these financial statements has been re-presented under IFRS.
The Group has taken advantage of the following exemptions as permitted under IFRS1 First Time Adoption of IFRS: Business combinations occurring before the date of transition on 1 November 2004 have not been restated.
Only equity instruments granted after 7 November 2002 that vest after the effective date of IFRS2 on 1 January 2005 have been valued.
The actuarial gains and losses approach to valuation of the defined benefit plans has not been applied retrospectively.
The initial recognition of the defined benefit schemes deficits is recorded on the face of the Group Balance Sheet as at 1 November 2004 date of transition.
The Group has not separately disclosed the amount of cumulative translation differences for its overseas operations included within retained earnings at 1 November 2004.
Tangible assets have continued to be reported on the basis of depreciated historical cost, as under UK GAAP.

EXPLANATION OF TRANSITION TO IFRS - continued Notes to the reconciliation of equity at 1 November 2004 and 31 October 2005 Significant changes to previously reported UK GAAP figures have been made in the following areas to comply with IFRS: A IFRS3 - Business Combinations Under IFRS3 there is a specific requirement to recognise separately identifiable intangible assets that meet the IFRS3 criteria principally customer relationships at fair value on acquisition and to amortise these over an appropriate period.
This reduces the amount of residual goodwill recognised.
As stated above, under IFRS1, business combinations prior to the date of transition are not required to be restated.
The adjustment is therefore limited to the five acquisitions completed since 1 November 2004.
In the year ended 31 October 2005 specific intangibles were identified, on acquisition, with a fair value of 3,000,000 and amortisation of 71,000 was charged.
B IFRS2 - Share-Based Payment Under IFRS2 charges are required for all share-based remuneration schemes.
These charges reflect the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant.
The operating profit charge for the year to 31 October 2005 for all relevant schemes under this standard was 477,000.
The opening IFRS balance sheet net assets are reduced by 76,000.
Net assets at 31 October 2005 are reduced by 328,000.
C IAS19 - Employee Benefits and Retirement Benefit Schemes Under IAS19 there is a requirement to recognise the monetary value of employee benefits accruing to employees but not yet settled: typically holiday pay.
There is a requirement to present the value of the liability for employee benefits to be paid in the future for services provided up to the reporting date.
A review of employee benefits across the Group identified an opening balance sheet adjustment of 518,000.
Under UK GAAP the Group accounted for defined benefit pension schemes in accordance with SSAP24, with disclosure as required under FRS17.
Under IAS19 there is a requirement to value defined benefit scheme assets at bid price rather than mid market price, and to disclose the retirement benefit asset obligation on the face of the balance sheet, with movement in the valuation of actuarial gains and losses through the Statement of Recognised Income and Expenditure SORIE.
At the date of transition, 1 November 2004, the initial increase in non-current liabilities is 16,115,000, with a corresponding deferred tax asset of 4,835,000 reported in non-current assets.
In addition, the previous SSAP24 prepayment of 252,000 has been reversed.
The charge to the Income Statement under IAS19 for retirement benefits includes three components, a service cost, the expected return on pension scheme assets and the unwinding cost of interest on the pension scheme liabilities.
D IAS10 - Events after the Balance Sheet Date There is a requirement under IFRS to only recognise the liability for dividends that have been proposed and approved at the balance sheet date.
E IAS21 - The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates Under IAS21 all foreign currency transactions and balances must be converted to the reporting entity currency at the rate applicable on the last day of the reporting period, i. e. at the spot rate.
UK GAAP permitted the use of an applicable forward currency contract rate instead of the spot rate.
F IAS12 - Income Tax Under UK GAAP deferred tax liabilities were discounted: under IFRS discounting is not permitted.
The impact as at 1 November 2004 was to increase deferred tax liabilities by 824,000.
The tax in the income statement for the year ended 31 October 2005 is 61,000 higher than it would have been under UK GAAP.
Under UK GAAP deferred tax liabilities on revaluation reserves were not provided for unless the Group entered into a binding contract to sell the revalued assets.
Under IAS12 deferred tax must be provided for.
The impact is to increase deferred tax liabilities as at 1 November 2004 by 1,081,000.
The Group has available capital losses to offset against any potential gain arising on these assets.
The impact as at 1 November 2004 is to recognise a deferred tax asset of 1,081,000.
Netting-off of assets and liabilities is not permitted under IAS12.
P 82 FIN ANCIAL ST A TEMENTS 2006 The reconciliation of equity at 1 November 2004 date of transition to IFRS and at 31 October 2005 date of last UK GAAP financial statements and the reconciliation of profit for the year ended 31 October 2005, as required by IFRS1, are given below.
There are no significant differences in cash flow between UK GAAP and IFRS consequently there is no cash flow statement reconciliation.
