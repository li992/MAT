Borrowings continued Convertible bonds The convertible bonds bear a xed coupon rate of 2.875% per annum, payable annually in arrears, and were issued at par value of 303.4 million on 19 September 2003.
Each 1,000 principal amount of a bond is convertible into one 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference share of the issuer, LogicaCMG Jersey Limited, with paid-up value of 1,000 that will, in turn, be exchangeable immediately for ordinary shares of LogicaCMG plc.
The bonds can be converted by the holders at any time between 29 October 2003 and up to 14 days prior to 19 September 2008.
The number of ordinary shares into which the bonds are convertible is determined by translating the principal amount into pounds sterling at a xed exchange rate of 1.44862 to 1 and then dividing by the prevailing exchange price.
The exchange price is the price at which the sterling-equivalent par value of the 2.875% exchangeable redeemable preference shares is converted into ordinary shares of the company.
The initial exchange price on issue was 372.53 pence per share.
Following the rights issue in November 2005, the exchange price was revised to 324.0 pence per share to re ect the bonus element of the rights issue.
The bond issuer may, at its option, redeem the bonds at any time from 3 October 2006 if the companys share price is greater than 140% of the prevailing exchange price on at least 20 dealing days during a period of 30 consecutive dealing days, or, at any time, if 85% or more of the principal amount of the bonds have been previously converted or purchased and cancelled.

IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements requires that liabilities should be classi ed as current when an entity does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
The convertible bonds are potentially exchangeable into ordinary shares of the company at any time up to 14 days prior to 19 September 2008.
Accordingly, the convertible bonds have been classi ed as a current liability even though settlement may ultimately not occur until the redemption date of 19 September 2008.
