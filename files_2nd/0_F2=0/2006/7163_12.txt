Annual Report and Accounts 2006 39 Hays plc 3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty i Retirement benefit obligations Under IAS 19 Employee Benets, the Group has recognised a pension deficit of 55.9 million 2005 69.7 million.
The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to gains on assets in the period less changes in the benefit obligations as a result of changes in discount rate and ination assumptions.
The main assumptions are set out in note 19 of the financial statements.
ii Goodwill impairment Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually.
In performing these tests, assumptions are made in respect of future growth rates and the discount rate to be applied to the future cash ows of income generating units.
These assumptions are set out in note 12 of the financial statements.
iii Provisions in respect of disposed businesses As described in note 20, provisions in respect of disposed businesses have been made.
In assessing the adequacy of these provisions, estimates are made of probable cash outows in the future.

The recoverable amount of a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of value in use calculations and its fair value less costs to sell.
The value in use calculations, use cash ow projections based on internal business plans approved by the Directors.
Following the above impairment tests, no impairment of goodwill was required in the year or the preceding year.
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash generating units CGUs that are expected to benefit from that business combination.
The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows: in s million 2006 2005 United Kingdom & Ireland 67.6 49.6 Continental Europe & Canada 51.0 49.8 Asia Pacic 7.6 126.2 99.4 The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates and growth rates.
Management estimates discount rates using post-tax rates that reect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the CGUs.
The growth rates are based on management forecasts.
The Group prepares cash ow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates cash ows for the following years based on an average estimated growth rate of 2.5%.
This rate does not exceed the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets.
The rate used to discount the forecast cash ows is 10%.

19Retirement benefit obligations Within the UK, the Group operates one dened contribution scheme and two dened benefit schemes.
The majority of overseas arrangements are either dened contribution or government-sponsored schemes and these arrangements are not material in the context of the Group results.
UK Dened contribution scheme The Hays Stakeholder Pension Plan was established on 1 July 2001.
Money purchase benets are funded by contributions from employees and, for eligible employees, from the employer.
Employer contributions are in the range of 2% to 15% of pensionable salary depending on the length of pensionable service and seniority.
The total cost charged to the income statement of 0.4 million 2005 0.2 million represents contributions payable to the Stakeholder Plan.
Contributions of nil 2005 nil were outstanding at the end of the year.
The assets of the Scheme are held separately from those of the Group.
UK Dened benefit schemes i The main scheme, the Hays Pension Scheme, is a dened benefit scheme where the benets are based on employees length of service and final pensionable pay.
It is a funded approved dened benefit scheme and closed to new members on 1 July 2001.
It is funded through a legally separate trustee administered fund.
ii The Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme is a supplementary unfunded, unapproved, retirement benefit scheme for employees who were subject to HMRCs earnings cap on pensionable salary.
The last formal actuarial valuations were performed at 30 June 2004.
A roll forward of the actuarial valuations of the Hays Pension Scheme and the Hays Supplementary Pension Scheme to 30 June 2006 has been performed by the Scheme actuary, an employee of Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
The key assumptions used at 30 June 2006 are listed on page 49.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 49 Hays plc 19Retirement benefit obligations continued IAS 19 accounting valuation In accordance with the amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benets, the disclosures below are provided prospectively from the 2005 financial year onwards.
Hays plc has applied the accounting requirements of IAS 19 as follows: scheme assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date: scheme liabilities are measured using a projected unit credit method and discounted at the current rate of return on high quality corporate bonds of equivalent term to the liability: and actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur, outside of the income statement, in retained earnings and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The key assumptions are as follows: 2006 2005 Ination assumption 2.90% 2.60% Discount rate 5.22% 4.95% Rate of increase in salaries 5.40% 5.10% Rate of increase of pensions in payment and deferment 2.90% 2.60% Expected long-term rates of return on scheme assets 6.53% 6.30% The assumption for the expected long-term returns for scheme assets is a weighted average based on the assumed expected return for each asset class and the proportions held of each asset class at the beginning of the year.
The long-term expected rate of return on scheme assets does not affect the level of the obligation but does affect the expected return on pension scheme assets within the net finance income charge.

Long Term Co-Investment Plan LTCIP Certain employees are invited to commit a number of shares to the LTCIP.
The TSR performance of the Group is then compared to a peer group of 15 including Hays over a three year period to determine the performance ranking of Hays relative to the peer group.
Dependent upon the ranking performance, the Company will match up to five times the number of shares committed by the employee.
If the ranking of Hays is ninth or less then there is no matching of shares by the Company.
During the year, 2.4 million invitations 2005 1.6 million invitations to the LTCIP were made.
The fair value of these invitations was 4.8 million 2005 2.6 million.
The fair value of invitations is calculated at the final date of commitment and is charged to the income statement over the vesting period of three years.
At the end of the year there were 2.2 million commitments for the 2006 invitation and 1.5 million commitments for the 2005 invitation.

com Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 34Reconciliation from UK GAAP to IFRS Pages 61 to 63 contain reconciliations from previously published UK GAAP results to IFRS.
The most significant areas of change to the Group on adoption of IFRS are summarised below: a Employee Benets IAS 19 Hays has elected, in accordance with IAS 19 Employee Benets to adopt a policy of accounting for dened benefit employee retirement schemes through full recognition of the schemes surpluses or deficits in the balance sheet at each year end.
Actuarial gains and losses will be recorded in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense SORIE.
This is similar to the approach required by the UK Standard FRS 17 Retirement Benets for which Hays plc has previously provided transitional disclosure information.
At the date of transition, all cumulative actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the balance sheet as permitted by IFRS 1.
The impact of adopting IAS 19 is a reduction in net assets of 65.7 million at 30 June 2005 1 July 2004 66.9 million.
profit after tax has reduced by 2.1 million for the year ended 30 June 2005. b Share-based Payment IFRS 2 Hays plc operates a number of share-based incentive schemes that are impacted by IFRS 2 Share-based Payment.
Under UK GAAP an expense is recognised where an intrinsic loss is suffered by the Group.
This means that for share options granted at the market price there is no charge to the income statement.
IFRS 2 requires the fair value of all equity instruments issued to be charged to the income statement.
For all Hays plc equity-settled share-based awards, the fair value has been calculated using a stochastic option valuation modelling approach.
The impact on the opening balance sheet is immaterial.
However, in future periods as more equity-settled share-based awards are made, the charge to the income statement will increase.
The impact on net assets at 30 June 2005 was an increase of 3.6 million 1 July 2004 0.5 million.
profit after tax has reduced by 0.6 million for the year ended 30 June 2005. c Goodwill IFRS 3 IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that goodwill arising on acquisitions is not amortised, but is subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
This results in an increase in both net assets and profit after tax of 13.2 million at 30 June 2005.
The net book value of goodwill at 30 June 2004 under UK GAAP is used as the opening net book value as permitted by IFRS 1 at 1 July 2004. d Dividends Payable IAS 10 Under UK GAAP, dividends are provided for in the year in respect of which they are declared or proposed by the directors.
Under IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date dividends are only recognised in the period in which they are formally approved for payment.
As a result, under IFRS the net assets have been increased by 36.1 million at 30 June 2005 in respect of dividends not formally approved at the balance sheet date 1 July 2004 34.3 million.
e Intangible Assets IAS 38 Computer software is recorded as an intangible asset unless it forms an integral part of the related hardware, in accordance with IAS 38 Intangible Assets.
Under UK GAAP, software is classied as property, plant and equipment.
There is no change to the useful economic lives and subsequent amortisation depreciation charges in respect of such assets.
Computer software recorded as an intangible asset amounted to 1.4 million at 30 June 2005 1 July 2004 1.2 million.
f Assets Held for Sale IFRS 5 Properties in respect of discontinued operations in Belgium and Germany which were previously included within tangible xed assets or debtors meet the criteria to be classied as assets held for sale under IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
These assets are held at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
There will be no subsequent depreciation on these assets as long as they remain classied as held for sale.
This results in a reclassication adjustment at 30 June 2005 of 0.2 million 1 July 2004 4.3 million.
g Deferred Tax IAS 12 The changes to deferred tax arise from presentational changes to disclose tax assets and liabilities.
There was no change to the net cash ow generated by operations as a result of the restatement to IFRS.
