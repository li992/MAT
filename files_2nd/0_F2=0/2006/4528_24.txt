NOTES TO THE COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 2 SEPTEMBER 2006 1 Accounting policies Accounting convention The balance sheet and associated notes are drawn up on the going concern basis under the historical cost convention in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards.
The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Investments Investments are held at cost less any provision for diminution in value.
Borrowings All borrowings are stated at the fair value of the consideration received after deduction of issue costs.
Issue costs together with finance costs, are charged to the profit and loss account over the term of the borrowings.
Finance costs represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
Taxation Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date.
Timing differences are differences between the taxable profits and the results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis.
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Changes in accounting policies The Company has adjusted its accounting policies to adopt the following new standards: FRS 20 Share-based Payments FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date FRS 25 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation FRS 26 Financial Instruments: Measurement Other accounting standards which have recently been issued have had no impact on the Companys accounting policies.
FRS 20 requires that the fair value of options awarded to employees is charged to the profit and loss account over the vesting period.
The Company does not incur a charge under this standard.
However, where the Company has granted options over the Company shares to employees of its subsidiaries, a capital contribution has been deemed to be made by the Company.
This is then recharged to the subsidiary and is based on the fair value of the options issued spread over the options vesting period.
Adopting FRS 20 has had no impact on the Companys net assets at 3 September 2005.
FRS 21 requires that dividends declared after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date as the liability does not represent a present liability.
In accordance with FRS 21, interim dividends are recognised when paid and final dividends are recognised when approved by the shareholders.
As a result of adopting FRS 21, the Companys net assets at 2 September 2006 increased by 20.6 million, there has been no impact on the net assets as at 3 September 2005.
The Company has adopted the presentation requirements of FRS 25.
This deals with the classification of capital instruments issued between equity and debt and the implication of that classification for accrued dividends and interest expenses.
The effect of the change in accounting policy to adopt the presentation requirements of FRS 25 was to reclassify 0.4 million of accrued interest on borrowings from accruals to bank loans and overdrafts.
114 Debenhams Annual report and accounts 2006 1 Accounting policies continued The adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 with effect from 4 September 2005 results in a change in the Companys accounting policy for financial instruments.
The impact of these standards on the Companys balance sheet is shown below.
The principal impact of FRS 26 on the Companys financial statements relates to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Any derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are held on the balance sheet at fair value with the changes in value reflected through the income statement.
The accounting treatment of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting depends on how they are designated.
Under FRS 26, derivative financial instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value with corresponding fair value changes deferred in equity.
The Company hedges interest rate risk through using interest rate swaps.
The adjustments to the balance sheet as at 4 September 2005 are as follows: Opening balance Effects of sheet at adopting Position at 4 September FRS 25 and 4 September 2005 FRS 26 2005 m m m Fixed assets Financial assets derivative financial instruments 0.8 0.8 Deferred tax assets 5.7 5.7 Creditors: amounts falling due within one year: Accruals and deferred income 10.8 0.4 10.4 Bank loans and overdraft 10.9 0.4 11.3 Creditors: amounts falling due after more than one year Financial liabilities derivative financial instrument 19.6 19.6 Impact on net assets 13.1 Hedging reserve 13.7 Retained earnings 0.6 Impact on equity shareholders funds 13.1 In accordance with the standard, the Company has elected not to apply FRS 26 to the financial year ended 3 September 2005.
Accordingly, the Company has continued to apply UK GAAP in the accounting for and disclosure of financial instruments in that period.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 25 not to present information on financial risk management and hedging where that information is presented in the same Group financial statements.
Accordingly, information on risk management and hedging may be found in notes 3 and 23 of the Group accounts.
Policies relating to UK GAAP comparatives Information in respect of derivatives for the year ended 3 September 2005 are presented on a UK GAAP basis as previously reported, which is as follows: Derivative financial instruments are accounted for using hedge accounting to the extent that they are held to hedge a financial asset or liability or future expenditure.
When a derivative financial instrument ceases to be a hedge, either as a result of the underlying asset or liability being extinguished, or because a future event is no longer likely to occur, the derivative is accounted for in the income statement.
The Company policy is not to use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
