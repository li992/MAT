Additional purchase consideration of up to17,000,000 and 2,500,000 is payable in respect of Netherlocks and Radio-Tech respectively, and has been provided at the estimated amount payable.
The amount ultimately payable is dependent upon the profit growth of the businesses over the financial years ending March 2006 and March 2007.
The adjustments to goodwill relating to prior years acquisitions comprise revisions to the estimate of deferred purchase consideration payable.
Adjustments were made to the book value of the net assets of the companies acquired to reflect their provisional fair value to the Group.
Acquired inventories were valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value adopting Group bases and any liabilities for warranties relating to past trading were recognised.
Other previously unrecognised assets and liabilities at acquisition were included and accounting policies were aligned with the Group where appropriate.

No trading or speculative transactions in financial instruments are undertaken.
Where it does use financial instruments these are mainly to manage the currency risks arising from normal operations and its financing.
Operations are financed mainly through retained profits and in certain geographical locations, bank borrowings.
Foreign currency risk is the most significant aspect for the Group in the area of financial instruments.
It is exposed to a lesser extent to other risks such as interest rate risk and liquidity risk.
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks and these policies are summarised below.
Policies have remained unchanged since the beginning of the financial year.
Foreign currency risk The Group has transactional currency exposures.
These arise on sales or purchases by operating companies in currencies other than the companies operating or functional currency.
Significant sales are hedged at the date of invoicing by means of matched borrowings and forward currency contracts.
Significant purchases are hedged by means of forward currency contracts.
The Group which is based in the UK and reports in Sterling, has a significant investment in overseas operations in the USA and Europe, with further investments in Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia, Singapore, China, India and Africa.
As a result, the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in these countries exchange rates.
Where significant and appropriate, currency denominated net assets are hedged by currency borrowings.
These currency exposures are reviewed regularly.
The Group does not hedge future currency profits, so the Sterling value of overseas profits earned during the year is sensitive to the strength of Sterling, particularly against the US Dollar and the Euro.
Finance and interest rate risk The Group does not have significant exposure to interest rate fluctuations.
Where bank borrowings are used to finance operations they tend to be short-term with floating interest rates.
Borrowings used to manage foreign currency risk are drawn on the Groups loan facilities and have fixed interest rates with maturities of not more than one year.
Surplus funds are placed on short-term fixed rate deposit or in floating rate deposit accounts.
Liquidity risk The Group has a strong cash flow and the funds generated by operating companies are managed regionally based on geographic location.
Funds are placed on deposit with secure, highly-rated banks.
For short-term working capital purposes, most operating companies utilise local bank overdrafts.
These practices allow a balance to be maintained between continuity of funding, security and flexibility.
Because of the nature of their use, the facilities are typically on demand and as such uncommitted.
Overdraft facilities are typically renewed annually.
Currency exposures The table below shows the Groups net foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities.
These are the assets and liabilities of Group companies which are not denominated in the functional currency of the company involved.
They comprise cash and overdrafts, and certain debtors and creditors.
These foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognised in the Consolidated income statement as a result of movement in exchange rates.
As at year end these exposures were as follows: Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 2006 Sterling US Dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of operation 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 2,151 1,213 140 3,504 US Dollar 93 1 2 94 Euro 24 212 33 155 Other 6 246 46 302 600 Total 111 2,609 1,260 407 4,165 Halma p. l. c. 2006 67 26 Financial instruments continued Net foreign currency monetary assets liabilities 2005 Sterling US Dollar Euro Other Total Functional currency of operation 000 000 000 000 000 Sterling 1,137 387 568 182 US Dollar 829 288 1,117 Euro 60 536 505 981 Other 24 699 78 200 953 Total 745 2,372 21 137 3,233 The amounts shown in the tables above take into account the effect of any forward currency contracts entered into to manage these currency exposures.
Interest rate risk profile The Groups financial assets which are subject to interest rate fluctuations comprise interest bearing cash equivalents which totalled 11,501,000 at 1 April 2006 2005: 35,581,000.
These comprised Sterling denominated deposits of 11,386,000 2005: 24,073,000, US Dollar denominated deposits of nil 2005: 3,663,000, and Euro and other currency deposits of 115,000 2005: 7,845,000 which are placed on local money markets and earn interest at market rates.
Cash balances of 24,325,000 2005: 9,767,000 earn interest at local market rates.
The financial liabilities which are subject to interest rate fluctuations are bank loans, bank overdrafts and certain unsecured loans, which totalled 32,308,000 at 1 April 2006 2005: 33,344,000.
All are subject to floating rates of interest.
These comprise US Dollar denominated bank loans of 18,497,000 2005: 19,577,000 which bear interest with reference to the US Dollar LIBOR rates, US Dollar denominated bank overdrafts of nil 2005: 13,000 which bear interest at rates referenced to US Dollar base rates, Euro denominated bank loans of 13,811,000 2005: 13,527,000 which bear interest with reference to the Euro LIBOR rates, Euro denominated bank overdrafts of nil 2005: 111,000 which bear interest at rates referenced to Euro base rates and Sterling denominated bank overdrafts of nil 2005: 116,000 which bear interest at rates referenced to UK base rates.
Maturity of financial liabilities With the exception of the deferred purchase consideration and other payables due after one year, all of the Groups financial liabilities mature in one year or less or on demand.
The total of deferred purchase consideration due after one year includes 1,346,000 2005: 3,948,000 due between one and two years, with the balance of 66,000 2005: 80,000 due between two and five years.
Other creditors due after more than one year include 1,220,000 2005: 740,000 due between one and two years, 2,279,000 2005: 786,000 due between two and five years, with the balance of 185,000 2005: 214,000 due after more than five years.
Borrowing facilities The Groups principal source of borrowing facilities is through on demand bank overdrafts which are, by definition, uncommitted.
These facilities are generally reviewed on an annual or ongoing basis and hence the facilities expire within one year or less.
The Group also has committed borrowing facilities which are used for the purpose of managing foreign currency risk.
In September 2005 the Group cancelled its existing 40 million of 364-day bilateral bank facilities and entered into a 60 million, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility with a small syndicate of its principal bankers.
The Groups undrawn committed facilities available at 1 April 2006 were 42,721,000, of which 15,029,000 mature within one year and 27,692,000 between four and five years.
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities As at 1 April 2006 there was no significant difference between the book value and fair value as determined by market value of the Groups financial assets and liabilities.
Hedging As explained above, the Groups policy is to hedge significant sales and purchases denominated in foreign currency using forward currency contracts.
The gains and losses on these instruments are recognised upon recognition of the underlying exposure.
The amounts of unrecognised gains or losses on instruments used for hedging at 1 April 2006 and 2 April 2005 are not significant.
With the exception of currency exposures, the disclosures in this note exclude short-term receivables and payables.

Commitments under operating leases Annual payments under non-cancellable operating leases will be made as follows: Land and buildings Other 2006 2005 2006 2005 000 000 000 000 Within one year 3,947 2,777 492 428 Within two to five years 8,075 6,338 522 501 After five years 2,767 3,204 3 13 14,789 12,319 1,017 942 28 Retirement benefits Group companies operate both defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes.
The Halma Group Pension Plan and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan have defined benefit sections with assets held in separate trustee administered funds.
Both of these sections were closed to new entrants during 2002 03 and a defined contribution section was established within the Halma Group Pension Plan.
Defined contribution schemes are mainly adopted in overseas subsidiaries.
Full actuarial valuations of the defined benefit schemes are carried out every three years.
The Halma Group Pension Plan was last assessed as at 1 December 2002, and the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan as at 1 April 2004, using the projected unit method.
At those dates the market value of the scheme assets were 42,533,000 for the Halma Group Pension Plan and 8,278,000 for the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan.
The actuarial value of these assets represented 69% and 59% respectively of the benefits that had accrued to members after allowing for expected future increases in earnings.
These shortfalls are being addressed by increased company contributions.
Defined contribution schemes The amount charged to the Consolidated income statement in respect of defined contribution schemes was 1,685,000 2005: 1,499,000.
Defined benefit schemes The assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities are: 2006 2005 2004 Rate of increase in salaries 4.25% 4.25% 4.25% Rate of increase of pensions in payment pre-April 1997 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Rate of increase of pensions in payment post-April 1997 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% Discount rate 5.00% 5.40% 5.50% Inflation assumption 2.75% 2.75% 2.75% The mortality assumption of the Halma Group Pension Plan was strengthened during the year to be consistent with the provisional assumption the Trustees agreed for the December 2005 actuarial valuation currently under review.
The actuary has used PA 92 tables with the Medium Cohort improvement factors plus one year for future mortality as compared with PA 92 tables for pensioners and PA 92 less three years for non pensioners in previous years.
The future life expectancies are around four years longer than those assumed at the previous financial year end.
For the Apollo Pension and Life Assurance Plan, the actuary has used PA 92 tables C 2020 for non pensioners and C 2010 for pensioners: this will be strengthened in accordance with the next actuarial valuation.
Halma p. l. c. 2006 69 28 Retirement benefits continued If assumed life expectancies had been one year greater in the defined benefit schemes, the gross deficit would have increased by 3.5 million.
