Contingent liabilities 2006 2005 million million Contingent liabilities 20 20 Litigation and environmental liabilities Contingent liabilities relate mainly to obligations arising from legal proceedings and environmental remediation activities, which, in the opinion of the directors, are not expected to have a materially adverse effect on the Group.
The Group is engaged in a number of legal proceedings relating to patent and other claims under contracts.
The Group is vigorously defending these cases, the estimated cost of which is disclosed above, and the directors currently believe that the claims are unlikely to be settled for amounts resulting in material cash or other asset outflows.
The Group is also engaged in a number of remediation activities at various sites, the costs of which are fully provided for.
It is possible that the remediation works at those sites could take longer to complete than expected, that additional contamination could be discovered, or that the governmental agencies involved could change their policy and require remediation to a higher standard than required at present, the estimated costs of which is disclosed above.
The directors currently believe that the remediation works are unlikely to require expenditure resulting in material cash or other asset outflows other than in accordance with the provisions held.
Guarantees At 31 March 2006, the Group had provided third parties with a total of 118 million of guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities, the exercise of which is considered to be remote.
At 31 March 2006, the value of total collateral against these various guarantees was 41 million.
In addition, we estimate that 71 million of the guarantees had varying conditional and unconditional rights to call for cash collateral.
telent Bonding Limited, a Group subsidiary, has available to it a committed bonding facility for 35 million until November 2007.
Under the terms of the facility telent Bonding Limited provides 50% cash collateral to the bonding provider.
The provider has unconditional rights to call for the balance, up to 100% cash collateral, at any time.
A maturity profile of all bonds and guarantees outstanding is set out below: Bonds Bonds outstanding outstanding at 31 March at 31 March 2006 2005 million million Expiring 31 March 2006 or earlier 54 2007 93 57 2008 7 7 2009 2 Thereafter 12 9 No expiry date 4 10 118 137 35.
Post-retirement benefits During the period to 23 January 2006, the Group operated defined benefit pension plans in the UK, USA, Germany and Italy, and post-retirement benefit plans in the USA.
On 23 January 2006, the Group disposed of its Telecommunications Equipment and International Services businesses to Ericsson.
The impact of this was a 60 million settlement gain on the transfer of overseas pension plans to Ericsson, which was offset by a cost of 61 million on transferring the plans to Ericsson, and a 4 million curtailment gain on the G. E. C. 1972 Plan the UK Pension Plan.
The most significant plan remaining with the Group is the UK Pension Plan.
A full actuarial valuation for the UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 5 April 2005 and a valuation for accounting purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent qualified actuaries.
For the US plans, full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2005 and were updated as applicable to 31 March 2006 for accounting purposes by independent qualified actuaries.
For the German unfunded plans, valuations were carried out for accounting purposes at 31 March 2006 by independent qualified actuaries.
Both the US and German plans were split between Ericsson and telent as a result of the disposal.
This split was based on the number of active members whose employment was transferred to Ericsson.
For the Italian unfunded plan, a valuation was carried out for accounting purposes at 31 December 2005 by independent qualified actuaries, prior to the transfer of the entire plan to Ericsson on 23 January 2006.
The contributions made to the plans in the year totalled 202 million 2005: 17 million.
Benefit payments in the year totalled 5 million 2005: 9 million.
For the unfunded pension plans and the post-retirement medical plans, payments are made when the benefits are provided.
Company contributions to the UK Pension Plan were 8.20% of pensionable pay in the year to 31 March 2006, and will increase to 8.35% in the next financial year.
In addition, the Company will directly pay the costs of administration of the UK Pension Plan and the newly introduced Pension Protection Fund levy.
The Group also made a voluntary contribution of 185 million into the UK Pension Plan in March 2006 to reduce the plan deficit.

Post-retirement benefits continued In the USA, on 25 March 2003, the Group signed a funding agreement with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation PBGC for the US defined benefit plans.
This agreement was amended on 17 February 2004.
Under this agreement, telent was required to contribute US dollar 2.25 million at the end of each calendar quarter to its US defined benefit plans, in addition to the annual normal cost associated with the continuation of benefits.
Effective from 13 August 2004, the quarterly contribution was reduced to US dollar 1.75 million, due to the transfer of the Reltec Retirement liability to Emerson following the sale of the OPP business.
On 22 December 2005, the Group accepted annuity bids from three US annuity providers, which will cover all the benefits owed under the Marconi USA Employees Retirement plan the US Plan, the only remaining defined benefit plan in the USA.
On 19 January 2006, the Group set up an escrow arrangement in the USA to provide any necessary funds to complete the annuity purchase.
Once the annuity purchase is finalised, the additional amount will be contributed to the Trust funding the US Plan and will be provided to the annuity carriers.
All benefits will then be provided for under annuity contracts issued by US carriers and therefore no further contributions will be required from the Group.
The Group operates defined contribution schemes in addition to the defined benefit schemes listed.
Contributions to these schemes amounted to 2 million 2005: 3 million.
A number of these defined contribution plans were transferred to Ericsson as part of the disposal in January 2006.
The major assumptions used by the actuaries to determine the liabilities on an IAS 19 basis for the significant defined benefit plans are set out below: At 31 March 2006 At 31 March 2005 At 31 March 2004 Rest of Rest of Rest of UK the world UK the world UK the world Average assumptions used % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa % pa Rate of general increase in salaries 4.25 4.25 4.25 4.12 4.75 4.17 Rate of increase in pensions in payment 2.75 N A 2.75 1.50 2.75 1.50 Rate of increase for deferred pensioners 2.75 N A 2.75 N A 2.75 N A Rate of credited interest 2.50 N A 2.50 N A 3.00 N A Discount rate applied to liabilities 5.00 5.09 5.50 5.11 5.50 5.63 Inflation assumption 2.75 2.22 2.75 2.12 2.75 2.25 Expected healthcare trend rates N A 10.5 N A 11.0 N A 11.5 preand preand preand post- 65, post- 65, post- 65, reducing reducing reducing to 6.0 to 6.0 to 6.0 after after after 2012 2012 2012 Expected prescription drug trend rates N A 12.0 N A 13.0 N A 14.0 reducing reducing reducing to 6.0 to 6.0 to 6.0 after after after 2012 2012 2012 The UK Pension Plan provides benefits to members on the best of three bases.
One of the bases is a money purchase underpin in which a discretionary level of credited interest is applied to a percentage of members contributions.
The discretionary level of credited interest has been treated as a constructive obligation.

In the UK this loss arose entirely from a reduction in discount rate from 5.50% to 5.00% as a result of changes in AA corporate bond rates.
Due to movements in the Eurobond rate in the year, discount rates were also reduced for the German Plan from 4.50% at 31 March 2005 to 4.00% at 31 March 2006, and for the Italian Plan from 4.00% at 31 March 2005 to 3.75% at 31 March 2006.
Both reductions resulted in losses recorded in the SORIE.
At 31 March 2005, due to movements in Eurobond rates during the year, the German and Italian Plan discount rates were reduced.
The German Plan discount rate was reduced from 5.50% at 31 March 2004 to 4.50% at 31 March 2005.
The Italian Plan discount rate was reduced from 5.00% at 31 March 2004 to 4.00% at 31 March 2005.
At 31 March 2006 the mortality assumptions for both the US and German plans were updated in line with the latest official mortality tables, which resulted in a loss of 8 million recorded in the SORIE.
At 31 March 2005, revisions to the UK Pension Plan mortality assumption led to a loss of 102 million recorded in the SORIE.
This revision recognised observed improvements in longevity in line with the most recent available plan data, plus an allowance for likely improvements in the future.
In the UK Pension Plan, the trustees have discretion to credit interest bonuses to pension awards, and during the year, the Groups credited interest assumption was reduced from 3.00% to 2.50% to align with actual expected awards, leading to a gain recorded in the SORIE.
A further gain was recognised as a result of a reduction in our salary growth assumption.
Significant gains were recognised in the SORIE in both years as a result of the difference between the actual rate of return and the expected rate of return on the pension plans assets.
In the years ended 31 March 2006 and 31 March 2005, actual investment returns in the UK Pension Plan exceeded expected returns across all classes of assets, resulting in a substantial asset gain.
The expected long-term rate of return has been derived by considering best estimates for the expected long-term real rates of return, for each class of asset.
The expected return for each asset class reflects a combination of historical performance analysis, the forward-looking views of the financial markets as suggested by available yields, and the views of investment organisations.
