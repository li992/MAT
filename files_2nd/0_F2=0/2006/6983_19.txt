As permitted by section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented its profit and loss account.
Gyrus Group PLC 80 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 Accounting conventions The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, with the exception of financial instruments which are held at fair value as required by FRS 26, and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
Basis of preparation The following accounting policies have been applied consistently, except in relation to the accounting treatment of options over the Companys equity granted to employees of subsidiary companies in accordance with UITF 41, in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the financial statements.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1, the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the parent undertaking includes the Company in its own published consolidated financial statements which can be found on pages 43 to 79 of this annual report and accounts.
The company has taken advantage of the exemption in Financial Reporting Standard 8 Related Party Disclosures not to disclose transactions with other members of Gyrus Group PLC.
Intangible assets licensing agreements Licensing agreements are included at cost and depreciated over their useful economic life.
Provision is made for any impairment.
Research and development Expenditure on research and development, including that from which development fees are derived, is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Intellectual property rights All expenditure on intellectual property rights, including the costs of patents and trademarks and the defence of the Groups intellectual property rights, is written off to the profit and loss account as incurred.
Foreign currencies Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate ruling on the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies, are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
The resulting exchange differences are charged to the profit and loss account for the year.
Derivative financial instruments The Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange risks and interest rate risks arising from operational and financing activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the Company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are recorded at fair value and any gains or losses on remeasurement of fair values is taken to the income statement.
However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resulting gain or loss depends on the nature of the item being hedged.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts is their quoted market price at the balance sheet date.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is the estimated amount that the Company would receive or pay to terminate the swap at the balance sheet date, taking into account current interest rates and the current creditworthiness of the swap counter parties.
Cash flow hedging When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability or highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instruments is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
If a hedge of a forecasted transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains or losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into the income statement in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed affects the income statement i. e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the Company revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the stated policy when the transaction occurs.
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, then the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Taxation Corporation taxes are recorded on taxable profits at the current rate.
Deferred tax is recognised without discounting, in respect of all timing differences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19: Deferred Tax.
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Gyrus Group PLC 81 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2006 Investment in subsidiary undertakings The Companys investment in subsidiary undertakings is stated at cost less any provision for impairment.
Fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost net of depreciation.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets by equal instalments over their estimated useful economic lives as follows: Fixtures and fittings 3-10 years Leasehold improvements term of lease Plant and machinery 3-10 years Pension scheme arrangements The Company operates a defined contribution scheme.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company in an independently administered fund.
The pension charge represents contributions payable by the Company to the fund.
Share based payment transactions In accordance with the transition provisions, FRS 20 has been applied to all grants of shares or share options made after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as of 1 January 2005.
The Company issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees.
Equity settled share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant.
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity settled share based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
The fair value of services received in return for share options granted to employees is measured by reference to the fair value of share options granted.
The estimate of the fair value of the services received is measured based on a stochastic option pricing model.
This model takes into account the following variables: exercise price, share price at grant, expected term, expected volatility of share price, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield.
The Company also gives employees the opportunity to purchase shares in the Company by participating in a share purchase plan.
The option price for the UK Save As You Earn scheme is the market price on the day preceding the invitation date discounted by a maximum of 20%.
The share options under this plan are also treated as equity settled share based payments and the fair value calculated using a stochastic model.
In May 2005, the Company issued the first grant under the Gyrus 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan.
This is a discretionary plan which provides for the grant of conditional awards or nil cost options over 1p Ordinary Shares in the Company.
Awards normally vest following the third anniversary of grant once certain performance conditions have been satisfied and provided that the participant remains employed by the Company.
The performance conditions are based on earnings per share growth.
The fair value of grants under this scheme are determined as being the mid market quote on the day preceding grant which is charged to the profit and loss evenly over the three-year vesting period based on the Groups estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Further options have been granted under this scheme in 2006 and details of those grants are contained in the Companys consolidated financial results on pages 67 to 68 of this Annual Report and Accounts.
Finance and operating leases Where the Company enters into a lease which entails taking substantially all the risk and rewards of ownership of an asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.
The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed asset and is depreciated over its estimated useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is the shorter.
Future instalments under such leases, net of finance charges, are included in creditors.
Rentals are apportioned on a sum of digits basis, between the finance element, which is charged to the profit and loss account, and the capital element, which reduces the outstanding obligation for future instalments.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and the rental charges are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease.
Gyrus Group PLC 82 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 1.
Prior year adjustment The accounts have been prepared on the same basis as the prior year except for the accounting treatment of options over the Companys equity granted to employees of subsidiary companies.
In accordance with UITF 41 the Company has accounted for equity settled share based payment arrangements with such employees as an increase in the value of the investment in the subsidiary company, the increase being the benefit that the Company receives for the services of the employees with no consideration payable by the subsidiary.
The effect of the prior year adjustment is to increase the value of investments in subsidiaries by 949,000 as at 31 December 2005 with a further increase of 1,457,000 as at 31 December 2006.
There is no impact on profit after taxation or earnings per share for the years ended 31 December 2005 and 31 December 2006.
The impact of the adjustment on investments in subsidiaries, net assets and reserves is shown below.

As at 10 November 2006, Gyrus Group PLC voluntarily reduced the revolving credit facility to USD$15 million.
The decision was made to avoid unnecessary non-utilisation costs on the unused portion of the facility.
The USD$250 million loan is for a fixed term of five years with repayments due as disclosed in this note.
The loan attracts a maximum rate of US dollar LIBOR plus 1.75% provided that Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the facility agreement is less than 3.50 and a minimum rate of US dollar LIBOR plus 0.75% provided that Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA is less than 1.00.
The margin on the facility from inception to 30 October 2006 was 1.75%.
As at 31 October 2006 the quarterly Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA fell below 3.00:1 resulting in a reduction in the margin on the facility of 0.5% to 1.25%.
Each advance drawn down under the USD$15 million revolving credit facility is repaid on the last business day of each fixed term interest period typically three to six months.
As the term of the revolving credit facility is for a period of five years from 21 July 2005, amounts drawn down under this facility are shown as non-current liabilities where repayments are due in greater than one year.
The interest rate for each advance drawn under the revolving facility is fixed on the date of the advance for the agreed interest period at US dollar LIBOR plus a margin.
The margin follows that applied to the main term loan facility.
There were no amounts drawn down under this facility as at 31 December 2006 2005: EUR5,000,000.
The USD$250 million loan and USD$15 million revolving credit facility are secured by a fixed and floating debenture on the assets of the Group.
Gyrus Group PLC 85 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 NOTES TO THE COMPANY ONLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTINUED 8.
Financial instruments Exposure to credit, interest rate and currency risk arises in the normal course of the Companys business.
Derivative financial instruments are used to hedge exposure in foreign exchange rates and interest rates.
Credit risk The credit risk on derivative financial instruments is very limited as the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by independent international credit rating companies.
Interest rate risk Hedging The Group adopts a policy of ensuring that at least 50% of its exposure to changes in interest rates on fixed term borrowings is hedged.
At 31 December 2006, the Group had entered into two interest rate cap and collar transactions.
The cap on both financial instruments is a US dollar LIBOR rate of 4.75% and the collars are 4.19% and 3.96% respectively.
Both instruments mature over the next five years consistent with the maturity of the related USD$250 million loan.
At 31 December 2006 the Group had interest rate hedges with a notional contract amount of USD$176,250,000 2005: USD$187,500,000.
The Group classifies interest rate hedges as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
This amount was recognised as a non-trade receivable in other current assets.
Includes a margin of 1.75% for the period 1 January 2006 to 30 October 2006 and a margin of 1.25% from 31 October 2006 to 31 December 2006.
The Company incurs foreign currency risk on intercompany transactions that are denominated in currencies other than sterling.
The currency primarily giving rise to this risk is the US dollar.
From time to time the Company enters into forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency risk.
When financing material asset purchases or acquisitions the Groups policy is to create a natural hedge as far as possible in respect of any borrowings used for such purposes.
In respect of the American Cystoscope Makers Inc ACMI acquisition, the Company applied this policy by raising the loan facility in US dollars, being the principal currency of the assets acquired and the trade of ACMI.
Gyrus Group PLC 86 Annual Report and Accounts 2006 The Company designates its forward exchange contracts of the variability of cash flows of a recognised asset and liability, or a highly probable forecasted transaction as cash flow hedges and states them at fair value.
The fair value of forward exchange contracts used as hedges of firm commitments and forecasted transactions at 31 December 2006 was nil 2005: nil.
Adjustments to the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported in equity when designated as effective hedges.
The ineffective portion is immediately recognised in the profit and loss account.
Otherwise the gains and losses will be reported in the profit and loss account only when the forecasted transaction occurs and is recognised in the profit and loss account.
During the year ended 31 December 2006, the company reported a loss on the movement in fair value of the interest rate hedge of 169,000 2005: gain of 864,000.
Interest income recognised in the income statement during 2006 resulting from the interest rate hedge was 421,000 2005: nil.
During 2005, a net gain of 1,980,000 was recorded in the income statement representing the ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge associated with the acquisition of ACMI.
Sensitivity analysis In managing interest rate and currency risks the Company aims to reduce the impact of short-term fluctuations on the Groups earnings.
The Company does not hedge its exposure to fluctuations in earnings based upon translation of foreign currency assets and liabilities.
Over the longer term, however, permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.
The USD$250 million loan and USD$15 million revolver facilities attract interest based on US dollar LIBOR.
It is estimated that a general increase of one percentage point in interest rates would have decreased the Companys profit before taxation by approximately 424,000 2005: 601,000.
Interest rate hedges have been included in this calculation.
