For transactions prior to 1 October 2003, connection revenue under US GAAP is recognised over the period that a customer is expected to remain connected to a network.
Connection costs directly attributable to the income deferred are recognised over the same period.
Where connection costs exceed connection revenue, the excess costs were charged in the statement of operations immediately upon connection.

The Group had previously concluded that the nature of the licences and the related goodwill acquired in business combinations Year ending 31 March m was fundamentally indistinguishable.

The Group has As discussed in note 10, during the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group recorded assigned amounts to licences and customer bases under US GAAP as they meet the impairment losses of 23,000 million in relation to the goodwill of Vodafone Germany criteria for recognition separately from goodwill, while these had not been recognised and Vodafone Italy under IFRS.
Under US GAAP, the Group evaluated the recoverability of separately from goodwill under UK GAAP because they did not meet the recognition the long-lived assets, comprised primarily of licences, in Vodafone Germany and criteria.
Under US GAAP, goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are Vodafone Italy using undiscounted cash flows and determined that the carrying amount capitalised and not amortised, but tested for impairment at least annually.

As a result, the IFRS impairment losses of 23,000 assets with finite lives are capitalised and amortised over their useful economic lives.

Under IFRS and US GAAP, the purchase price of a transaction accounted for as an acquisition is based on the fair value of the consideration.
In the case of share During the year ended 31 March 2006, the Group also recorded an impairment loss consideration, under IFRS the fair value of such consideration is based on the share price under IFRS of 515 million and 4,900 million in relation to the goodwill of Vodafone on the date of exchange.
Under US GAAP, the fair value of the share consideration is Sweden and Vodafone Japan, respectively.
Under US GAAP, the Group recognised based on the average share price over a reasonable period of time before and after the impairment losses of licences of 883 million and 8,556 million in Vodafone Sweden proposed acquisition is agreed to and announced.

The fair value of the goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and f. Capitalised interest the fair value of the identifiable net assets of the reporting unit.
Intangible assets with Under IFRS, the Group has adopted the benchmark accounting treatment for borrowing finite lives are subject to periodic impairment tests when circumstances indicate that an costs and, as a result, the Group does not capitalise interest costs on borrowings in impairment loss may exist.
Where an assets or asset groups carrying amount exceeds respect of the acquisition or construction of tangible and intangible fixed assets.
Under its sum of undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment loss is recognised in an US GAAP, the interest costs of financing the acquisition or construction of network amount equal to the amount by which the assets or asset groups carrying amount assets and other fixed assets is capitalised during the period of construction until the exceeds its fair value, which is generally based on discounted cash flows.

Interest costs of financing the acquisition of licences are also capitalised until the date that the related network service is launched.

All intangible assets acquired, other underlying shares on the date of exercise, with any changes in this estimate recognised than goodwill, are deemed to be of finite life, with a weighted average amortisation period in the consolidated income statement each period.
