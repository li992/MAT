50 Notes to the Consolidated Accounts continued for the year ended 30 April 2006 2.
SEGMENT INFORMATION Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups business and geographical segments.
The primary format, business segments, is based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
Reportable business segments have changed from those reported previously.
Segmental information now reflects the change in the Groups reporting structure announced last year, giving the three major divisions focused on the Companys core business areas.
These are Public Services, Human Resources and Managed Services which include part of the former Corporate Services division and some Managed Services that were previously reported in Public Services.
Comparative information for the year ended 30 April 2005 has been restated accordingly.
All business segments are continuing operations.
Within information by geographical segment, revenue from external customers is analysed by geographic destination.
This is not materially different from that analysed by geographic origin.
