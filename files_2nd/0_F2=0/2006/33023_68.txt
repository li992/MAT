They should also align the interests of employees with those of shareholders, as a whole, through long-term share ownership in the Company.
The Groups current UK, Swedish and US schemes are described below: other arrangements apply elsewhere.

The first grant of options occurred in August 2000.
The main grant of options in 2006 under the plan was in March, with a further smaller grant in August.

The first grant of awards was made in June 2005.
The main grant of awards in 2006 under the plan was in March, at the same time as options were granted under the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
Awards granted under the plan vest after three years depending on the performance of the Company compared with that of a selected peer group of other pharmaceutical companies.
The Remuneration Committee has responsibility for agreeing any awards under the plan and for setting the policy for the way in which the plan should be operated, including agreeing performance targets and which employees should be invited to participate.
A fuller description of this plan can be found on page 86 in the Directors Remuneration Report.
Sweden In Sweden an all-employee performance bonus plan is in operation, which rewards strong individual performance.
Bonuses are paid partly in the form of Ordinary Shares in the Company and partly in cash.
Existing Ordinary Shares purchased in the market are used to pay bonuses awarded under the plan.
The AstraZeneca Executive Annual Bonus Scheme and the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan both operate in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in Sweden.
US In the US, there are two all-employee performance bonus plans in operation, which reward strong individual performance.
There are also two senior staff incentive schemes, under which approximately 140 participants are awarded either AstraZeneca ADSs or stock appreciation rights related to AstraZeneca ADSs.
AstraZeneca ADSs necessary to satisfy the awards are purchased in the market.
The AstraZeneca Share Option Plan operates in respect of relevant AstraZeneca employees in the US.

4 Summary of the Astra Shareholder Value Incentive Plan In 1996, Astra established a stock option plan for some 100 Astra employees in key senior positions.
The plan is no longer used for the grant of options and has been superseded by the AstraZeneca Share Option Plan.
On completion of Astras merger with Zeneca, options in Astra shares granted under the plan were replaced by options to acquire a number of AstraZeneca Ordinary Shares based on the exchange ratio used in the exchange offers used to effect the AstraZeneca merger.
The ratio of AstraZeneca options granted in respect of former Astra options was 0.5045 AstraZeneca options for each Astra option held.
At 31 December 2006, there were no options outstanding under this scheme.
The fair value of the options is estimated at the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The following table gives the assumptions applied to the options granted in the respective periods shown.
Expectations of early exercise are incorporated into the model.

No other features of options granted were incorporated into the measurement of fair value.
The charge for share-based payments in respect of share options is $125m 2005 $128m, 2004 $147m which is comprised entirely of equitysettled transactions.
