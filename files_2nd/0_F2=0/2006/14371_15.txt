Equity 2006 2005 At 31 December...................................................... $2,227m $1,597m US GAAP equity in 2006 is $53m higher than IFRS with the main differences being the higher book value of $73m for goodwill and intangibles less deferred tax of $34m, most of which is related to adjustments to goodwill and intangibles, resulting from: recognition in US GAAP of goodwill set off directly to reserves pre-1998 under IFRS, less related deferred tax liabilities: recognition of intangible assets, separately from goodwill thereby increasing amortisation and reducing the net balance of goodwilland intangibles and increasingrelated deferred tax liabilities: and in-process research and development written off in accordance with US GAAP which was capitalised underIFRS.
