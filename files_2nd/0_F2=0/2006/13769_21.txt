The Sage Group plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 p108 Notes to the Accounts - Company For the year ended 30 September 2006 PARENT COMPANY ACCOUNTING POLICIES a Basis of accounting These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and applicable accounting standards in the United Kingdom.
A summary of the more important Company accounting policies, which have been consistently applied, is set out below.
b Foreign currency translation Foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated into sterling at rates of exchange ruling at the year-end.
Differences arising on the re-translation of the net investments and the results for the year are taken directly to reserves together with differences on foreign currency borrowings to the extent that they are used to finance or provide a hedge against equity investments in foreign enterprises.
All other exchange differences are dealt with in the profit and loss account.
c Deferred tax Deferred tax is accounted for under FRS 19, which requires a form of full provision for accounting for deferred tax, called the incremental liability approach.
Deferred tax is provided on timing differences where the Company has an obligation to pay more tax in the future as a result of those timing differences.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised if it is considered more likely than not that there will be suitable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
As permitted by FRS 19, the Company has adopted a policy of not discounting deferred tax assets and liabilities.
d Investments Fixed asset investments are stated at cost less provision for any diminution in value.
e Parent Company profit and loss account The amount of loss for the financial year before dividends within the accounts of the parent Company is 16.0m 2005: 234.5m profit.
There is no material difference between the profits and losses as reported above and historical cost profits and losses and there are no other gains or losses in the year.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985. f Changes in accounting policies The Group has adopted FRS 21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date in the financial statements.
The adoption of this standard represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly.
Details of the effect of the prior year adjustment have been given in note 7.
Other accounting standards which have recently been issued have had no impact on the Companys accounting policies.
