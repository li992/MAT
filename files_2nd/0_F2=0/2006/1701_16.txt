com 65 Notes to the consolidated financial statements 1 Accounting policies The financial statements of the group are for the year ended 31 March 2006 and have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS, International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee IFRIC interpretations issued and effective or issued and early adopted as at 31 March 2006 and with those parts of the Companies Act 1985 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
The financial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue but not yet effective: IFRS 6 Exploration for and Evaluation of Mineral Resources IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures: and the related amendment to IAS 1 on capital disclosures IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease IFRIC 5 Rights to Interest Arising from Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Finds IFRIC 6 Liabilities Arising from Participating in a Specic Market Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment IFRIC 7 Applying the Restatement Approach under IAS 29 Financial Reporting in Hyperinationary Economies IFRIC 8 Scope of IFRS 2 IFRIC 9 Reassessment of Embedded Derivatives The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the financial statements of the group except for additional disclosures on capital and financial instruments when the relevant standards come into effect for periods commencing on or after 1 January 2007.
The groups principal accounting policies adopted in the presentation of these financial statements are set out below and have been consistently applied to all the periods presented.
a Basis of preparation The disclosures required by IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards showing reconciliations for comparative periods between UK GAAP and IFRS are shown in note 40.
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, as modied by the revaluation of available for sale financial assets and financial liabilities including derivative instruments at fair value through profit or loss.
b Basis of consolidation i Subsidiaries Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which power to control is transferred to the group.
They are fide-consolidated from the date on which control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the group.
On acquisition the identiable assets, liabilities and contingent assets are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition.
The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the groups share of the identiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the groups share of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognised directly in the income statement.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between group companies are eliminated.
Subsidiaries accounting policies have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the group.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 66 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued ii Joint ventures Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the group has the ability to exercise joint control, established by contractual agreement.
The groups interests in jointly controlled enterprises are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
The consolidated financial statements include the group's share of the total recognised income and expense of the jointly controlled enterprises on an equity accounting basis, from the date that joint control commences until the date that joint control ceases.
Jointly controlled operations and assets, where each party has its own separate interest in particular risks and rewards, are accounted for by including the attributable share of the assets, liabilities and cash ows measured according to the terms of the agreement.
To the extent that joint ventures have net liabilities and a contractual commitment exists for the group to settle those net liabilities, the aggregate amount is added back to investments and offset rstly against loans and trading balances with the joint venture, with any excess transferred to provisions.
iii Associates Associates are entities over which the group has the power to exert significant inuence but not the power to control, generally accompanying a shareholding of between 20 per cent and 50 per cent of the voting rights.
Investments in associates are accounted for by the equity method of accounting and are initially recognised at cost.
c Assets held for sale Where an asset or group of assets a disposal group is available for immediate sale and the sale is highly probable and expected to occur within one year, the disposal group is deemed held for sale.
At this point the gross assets and gross liabilities of the disposal group are shown separately as held for sale.
The value of the disposal group is measured at the lower of the carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
d Revenue recognition Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net of value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within the group.
Revenue is recognised as follows: i Water and wastewater services revenue includes an estimation of the amount of mains water and wastewater charges unbilled at the period end.
The revenue accrual is estimated using a dened methodology based upon weighted average water consumption by tariff, which is calculated based upon historical billing information.
ii Construction contracts revenue from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the groups accounting policy on construction contracts note o. iii Property development where legally binding contracts exist, revenue and expenses on the construction and refurbishment elements of property development are recognised on the same basis as for construction, in proportion to the stage of completion of the contact.
iv Services contracts revenue from service contracts is recognised by reference to the stage of completion, as measured by reference to services performed to date as a percentage of total services to be performed.
v Insurance claims and other recoveries where expenditure on a contract is expected to be reimbursed by a third party such as an insurance company, revenue is recognised only when receipt of the amount is virtually certain.
vi Interest income recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
vii Dividend income recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
e Segmental reporting The groups primary reporting segments are business segments, each of which provide services that are subject to risks and returns that are different from those of the other segments.
Geographical segments are reported as secondary segments.
com 67 f Foreign currency translation In the accounts of the groups companies, individual transactions denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currency at the actual exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into local currency at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date.
profits and losses on both individual foreign currency transactions during the year and monetary assets and liabilities are dealt with in the income statement.
Differences on foreign currency borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a foreign operation are taken directly to equity until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
On disposal of a foreign operation, the deferred cumulative amount recognised in equity, subsequent to 1 April 2004, relating to that particular foreign operation shall be recognised in the income statement.
On consolidation, the income statements of the overseas subsidiaries are translated at the average exchange rates for the year and the balance sheets at the exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The exchange differences arising as a result of translating income statements at average rates and restating opening net assets at closing rates are taken to the translation reserve.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings are taken to reserves to the extent that they provide an effective hedge of the exchange differences arising on net investments in foreign subsidiaries.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of an overseas subsidiary, associate or joint venture is calculated using exchange rates applicable at the date of acquisition and is subsequently re-translated at each balance sheet date.
g Derivative financial instruments and hedging The group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risks arising from operational, nancing and investment activities.
In accordance with its treasury policy, the group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
However, derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivatives are initially recognised at cost and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The group designates certain derivatives as either a fair value or cash ow hedge in accordance with IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
i Fair value hedge Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedges are recorded in the income statement, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability attributable to the hedged risk.
ii Cash ow hedge The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated and qualifying as cash ow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss for example, in the periods when interest income or expense is recognised, or when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when disposal of the foreign operation occurs.
iii Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Such derivatives are classied at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 68 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued h Property, plant and equipment Property, plant and equipment comprises: Land and buildings comprising land and non-operational buildings i. e. buildings not used for water and wastewater treatment.
Infrastructure assets comprising a network of systems consisting of mains and sewers, impounding and pumped raw water storage reservoirs, sludge pipelines and sea outfalls.
Operational assets comprising structures at sites used for water and wastewater treatment, pumping or storage where not classed as infrastructure along with associated xed plant.
Vehicles, mobile plant and equipment.
All property, plant and equipment is shown at cost less subsequent depreciation and impairment, except for land and assets under construction, which are shown at cost less impairment.
Cost includes expenditure directly attributable to the acquisition or construction of the items.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate assets.
Borrowing costs incurred for the construction of qualifying assets are capitalised during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use.
Other borrowing costs are expensed.
Subsequent costs are included in the assets carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benets associated with the item will ow to the group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
All other repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated, nor are assets in the course of construction until commissioned.
Depreciation on other assets is charged at rates expected to write off cost less estimated residual value to the income statement on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life, as follows: Non-operational buildings 30-60 years Water infrastructure 50-120 years Wastewater infrastructure 50-160 years Operational structures 30-80 years Fixed plant 12-40 years Vehicles, mobile plant and equipment 3-10 years Residual values and useful lives of assets are reassessed annually, and adjusted if appropriate.
An impairment loss is recognised immediately if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount.
The gain or loss on disposal or retirement of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds or compensation received and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
i Grants and contributions Grants and contributions comprise government grants, infrastructure and connection charges, sewer adoption charges, deficit contributions for requisitioned water and wastewater infrastructure under the Water Acts, non-domestic deficit contributions, other capital and revenue contributions, and contributions for infrastructure diversions.
Capital grants and contributions are credited to a deferral account within creditors and are released to revenue evenly over the expected useful life of the related assets.
deficit contributions are also credited to a deferral account within creditors, and are recognised as revenue in line with the expected expenditure they are intended to compensate.
Contributions for diversion are allocated between compensation for the loss of the asset given up, treated in accordance with the asset disposal policy, and capital contribution towards the cost of the replacement asset according to the nature of the diversion.
com 69 j Intangible assets i Goodwill Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures.
In respect of business acquisitions that have occurred since 1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the groups share of net identiable assets acquired.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 April 2004 goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.
This is in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill is allocated to income-generating units and, from the date of transition to IFRS, is no longer amortised but is tested annually for impairment.
In respect of joint ventures and associates, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture or associate.
ii Computer software Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specic software.
These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives of two to seven years.
Costs associated with maintaining computer software are recognised as an expense as incurred.
iii Customer lists The fair value attributable to customer lists or portfolio at the point of acquisition is determined by discounting the expected future cash ows to be generated from that asset.
This amount is included in intangible assets as customer lists and amortised over the estimated useful life on a straight-line basis.
Amortisation periods are currently 10 years but will be dependent on the business.
Separate values are not attributed to internally generated customer lists or relationships.
k Leased assets Leases of property, plant and equipment where the group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as finance leases.
Finance leases are capitalised at the leases inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the finance balance outstanding.
The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in other non-current payables.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period.
The property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases is depreciated over the shorter of the assets useful life and the lease term.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classied as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases net of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
The land and buildings elements of a lease are considered separately for the purpose of lease classication.
l Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to insignicant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity of six months or less.
For the purpose of the consolidated cash ow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents as dened above, net of bank deposits with original maturity dates of more than three months and outstanding bank overdrafts.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 70 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued m Investments The group has restated its comparatives to adopt IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 from 1 April 2004.
After initial recognition at cost being the fair value of the consideration paid, investments which are classied as held for trading or available for sale are measured at fair value, with gains or losses recognised in income or equity respectively.
When an available for sale investment is disposed of, or impaired, the gain or loss previously recognised in equity is taken to the income statement.
Other investments are classied as held to maturity when the group has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity and there is a set maturity date.
Investments held for an undefined period are excluded from this classication.
Such investments and those held to maturity are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with any gains or losses being recognised in the income statement.
n Inventories Inventories including development land and properties are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
o Construction contracts Where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date, as measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for work performed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs.
Claims are only recognised as revenue when negotiations are at an advanced stage and the outcome is substantially agreed.
Following initial recognition, provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts is made whenever ultimate payment seems doubtful.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable.
Contract costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred.
Full provision is made for all known or expected losses on individual contracts immediately such losses are foreseen.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to the extent that it is probable they will result in revenue.
Where costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings, the balance is shown as due from customers on construction contracts within trade and other receivables.
Where progress billings exceed costs incurred plus recognised profits less recognised losses, the balance is shown as due to customers on construction contracts within trade and other payables.
p Bid and pre-contract costs Bid and pre-contract costs are expensed as incurred until it is probable that a contract will be awarded, from which time further pre-contract costs are recognised as an asset and amortised as an expense over the period of the contract.
Amounts recovered in respect of costs that have been written off are deferred and amortised over the life of the contract.
q Borrowings Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classied as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Redeemable shares, mandatorily redeemable at par at the option of shareholders, are classied as liabilities.
Non-discretionary dividends on these redeemable shares are recognised in the income statement as interest expense.
com 71 r Deferred income tax Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements.
The deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction, other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss.
Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred income tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
s Employee benets i Pensions The group companies operate various pension schemes.
The schemes are funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations performed by independent actuaries.
The group has both dened benefit and dened contribution schemes.
The group has chosen under IFRS 1 to recognise in retained earnings all cumulative actuarial gains and losses as at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS.
The group has chosen to recognise actuarial gains and losses arising subsequent to 1 April 2004 in full in retained earnings in the period in which they occur, and in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of dened benefit pension schemes is the present value of the dened benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of scheme assets.
The dened benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method with updates performed at half year.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash outows using interest rates of sterling denominated AA credit rated bonds with maturity dates approximating to the terms of the groups obligations.
Contributions to dened contribution schemes are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
ii Share-based payments The group operates a Save As You Earn SAYE share option scheme for all employees to encourage participation in the groups results.
In addition the group operated an Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS until 2003, which was then replaced by a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
Participation in the ESOS and LTIP schemes is restricted to Executive Directors and a number of senior managers.
The group determines the fair value of share options granted using a binomial option pricing model and their fair value is recognised as an employee benets expense with a corresponding increase in other reserve equity over the vesting period.
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital nominal value and share premium when the options are exercised.
t Research expenditure Research expenditure is expensed when incurred.
u Provisions A provision is recognised when the group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event for which it is probable that an outow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably estimated.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ows at a pre-tax rate that reects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specic to the liability.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 72 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 1 Accounting policies continued u Provisions continued The groups policy on specic areas is as follows: i Onerous lease costs Provision is made for the expected future costs of property and other leases to the extent that these costs are not expected to be of future benefit to the business, net of any recoveries from sub-leases.
ii Closure costs Once irrevocable decisions have been made to close an operation, provisions are made to reect the extent to which obligations, including redundancy costs, have been incurred that are not expected to be covered by future profits of the operation.
Provisions include only the direct costs of termination and any operating losses up to the date of the termination, after taking account of the aggregate profit, if any, to be recognised from the future profits of the operation.
iii Redundancy costs Redundancy costs are charged to the income statement in the period in which the group both becomes irrevocably committed to incurring the costs and has raised a valid expectation with, and announced the main features of the programme to, affected employees or their representatives.
iv Self insurance Some subsidiary companies self insure the risks where it is commercially prudent to do so.
Provision is made in respect of notied claims to the extent that it is probable that a cash settlement will arise.
Provision is made in the groups captive insurance company, Rutland Insurance Limited, for the expected cost of claims incurred but not reported.
The provision is determined from an actuarial assessment based on past experience.
v Bad and doubtful debts In Anglian Water the bad debt provision is calculated by applying expected recovery rates, based on actual historical cash collection performance, to the aged debt prole.
In the remaining subsidiary companies specic provisions are made for those debts on which recovery is regarded as doubtful.
w Key assumptions and significant judgments The group use estimates and make judgments in the preparation of its financial statements.
The areas where the most judgment is required are highlighted below.
i Goodwill impairment Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis.
In performing these tests assumptions are made in respect of the discount rate applied to the future cash ows of income-generating units.
This discount rate is selected on the basis of the inherent risk associated with the income-generating unit.
ii Pensions The group operates a number of dened benefit schemes most of which are closed to new members as well as dened contribution schemes.
Under IAS 19 Employee Benets the group has recognised a pension deficit of 105.0 million 2005: 216.6 million.
The change in the deficit is mainly attributable to changes in certain scheme benets such as ill health and early retirement, and changes in discount rate and ination assumptions.
The main assumptions are set out in note 28 of the financial statements.
iii Property, plant and equipment The property, plant and equipment used in the group is primarily the infrastructure and operational assets of the regulated water business.
These have estimated service lives of between 30 and 160 years and the depreciation charge is clearly sensitive to the lives allocated to the various types of asset.
Asset lives are reviewed regularly and changed where necessary to reect the current view on their remaining lives in light of the technological change, prospective economic utilisation and the physical condition of the assets.
iv Taxation The groups tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates in force at the balance sheet date.
Estimation of the tax charge involves an assessment of the potential tax treatment of certain items which will only be resolved once nally agreed with the tax authorities.
com 73 2 Segmental analysis Primary reporting format business segments for the year ended 31 March 2006 At 31 March 2006 the group is organised into three main businesses: Anglian Water: regulated water, wastewater and environmental service provider to domestic and industrial customers in eastern England and Hartlepool.
AWG Property: commercial and residential property developer.
The Morrison business is further analysed into the following segments of the group: Utility Services: manages infrastructure maintenance, renewals, installation and specialist services to blue-chip utility clients in the gas, water, electricity and telecommunications sectors.
Facilities Services: provides repair and maintenance and capital investment services to local authority clients.
Other support services: provides contracting for water and wastewater treatment processes.
Morrison centre: provides financial and administrative support to the Morrison businesses.
Whilst this does not strictly meet the criteria for classication as a segment under IFRS, the Directors believe that separate disclosure is important to understanding the overall performance of Morrison.

The group issues index-linked debt and additionally uses swaps to achieve the desired level of index-linked debt.
The index-linked debt issued qualies for hedge accounting under IAS 39 whereas the synthetic swaps used do not qualify for hedge accounting and consequently are held at fair value with movements taken to the income statement.

Goodwill has been tested for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of each income-generating unit, including goodwill, with the recoverable amount of that income-generating unit.
The recoverable amount of an income-generating unit is determined based on the higher of value in use calculations and its fair value less costs to sell.
These value in use calculations use cash ow projections based on internal business plans approved by the Directors covering a three-year period.
Following the above impairment tests, no impairment of goodwill was required in the year or the preceding year.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 86 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 13 Goodwill continued The net book value of goodwill at 31 March 2006 relates to the Utility Services and Facilities Services businesses within Morrison and the remaining Project Investments concessions reported as part of the other segment.

These cash ows are similar to those achieved in 2005 6.
The internal business plan estimates operating cash ows for the next three years and these have been extrapolated to five years assuming a growth rate of 2.25 per cent.
Thereafter, a terminal value has been applied.
The growth rate does not exceed the long-term average growth rate for the industry in which the income-generating unit operates.
A pre-tax weighted average discount rate of 10.5 per cent has been used to discount the cash ows.
This is in line with the expected returns from the sector.
Project Investments The recoverable amount is based on an offer recently received from a potential purchaser, less an estimate of the costs to sell.

Under the terms of the groups index-linked swaps, the index-linked base upon which interest is calculated increases with RPI over time, whereas the oating base remains unchanged.
Consequently the 53.7 million 2005: 36.2 million total of effect of swaps relates to the increase in the notional capital value upon which interest is payable.

Fair values of other non-current investments, non-current trade and other receivables, provisions excluding joint ventures net liabilities and non-current trade and other payables have been estimated as not materially different from book value.
Derivative transactions expose the group to credit risk against the counterparties concerned.
Anglian Water has credit protection measures in place within agreements which provide protection in the event of counterparty rating downgrade or default.
Other group subsidiaries entering into such transactions generally do so under the terms of exposure netting agreements such that the credit risk is limited to the net value of transactions within each subsidiary and counterparty combination.
The group only enters into derivative transactions with banks of high credit standing as measured by reputable rating agencies and also seeks to diversify exposure such that concentration with individual banks is avoided.

A number of dened contribution schemes operate predominantly in the UK and contributions to these schemes amounted to 5.1 million 2005: 4.3 million.
There were no outstanding or prepaid balances at the year end.
The accounting for pension costs has been undertaken in accordance with IAS 19, based on the most recent actuarial valuations, updated by independent actuaries to take account of the requirements of IAS 19 in order to assess the assets and liabilities of the schemes as at 31 March 2006.
The most recent actuarial valuations for AWGPS and MPLAP were carried out at 31 March 2005, and in the case of the other main scheme, AWGPLAP, the most recent actuarial valuation was at 31 March 2003.
The principal actuarial assumptions used for the valuation update were as follows: 2006 2005 Ination assumption 2.8% 2.8% Discount rate 4.9% 5.4% 1 Salary increase assumption 3.8% 3.8% Rates of increase to pensions in payment 2.8% 2.8% Increase to deferred benets during deferment 2.8% 2.8% Longevity at age 65 for current pensioners years Men 18.6 18.5 Women 21.5 21.4 Longevity at age 65 for future pensioners years Men 19.9 19.3 Women 22.8 22.2 The group contributed 20.1 per cent of pensionable pay into AWGPS in the year plus 7.7 million in deficit reduction payments.
The group contributions as a proportion of pensionable pay to the two other main schemes, MPLAP and AWGPLAP, were 13.2 per cent and 20.3 per cent respectively.
For the year ending 31 March 2007 the expected contribution rates for AWGPS and AWGPLAP are 14.9 per cent and 20.3 per cent respectively.
The estimated amount of contributions expected to be paid into the groups dened benefit schemes during the year ended 31 March 2007 is approximately 43.0 million.
1 For the AWGPS the salary increase assumption has been restricted in 2006 to RPI for the remainder of the current regulatory period to 2009 10.
com 101 Dened benefit schemes The long-term expected rates of return on the dened benefit schemes assets are determined as follows: 2006 2005 % pa % pa Equities 7.3% 7.7% Corporate bonds 4.7% 5.1% Government bonds 4.3% 4.7% Property 6.3% 6.7% Other 4.4% 4.8% The expected return on scheme assets are based on long-term expectations at the beginning of the year for returns over the entire life of the benefit obligations.
These returns are determined by setting rates of return for equities and property by adopting xed margins above current gilt yields.
The expected rates of return for corporate bonds and gilts have been based on market yields at the balance sheet date, with equity and property returns assumed to be 3.0 per cent per annum and 2.0 per cent per annum respectively above gilt returns.
For the purposes of the following analyses the MPLAP, AWGPLAP and other smaller funded dened benefit pension schemes have been aggregated and are referred to as total other funded schemes.
As the AWGPS is the groups principal pension scheme it has been shown separately.
An allowance for expenses for all schemes, including AWGPS is included in total other funded schemes.

These provisions are discounted and are expected to be utilised over the next 17 years.
Business closure and disposal provisions relate to exit costs, principally the disposal of Morrison Construction Services and the international businesses, which are expected to crystallise over a period of approximately two years.
com 105 The contract and other provisions comprise potential warranty and certication costs of 5.3 million, which are expected to crystallise over a period of approximately three years and 4.2 million in respect of insurance claims against the group incurred but not reported, which are expected to be utilised over a period of approximately 10 years.
This provision has been made following an actuarial assessment of the obligation taking account of past claims experience.
The coupon enhancement provision of 22.0 million relates to coupon enhancement and other related costs incurred on the transfer of debt from AWG Group Limited to Anglian Water Services Financing Plc at the end of the renancing exercise in 2002.
The provision relates to several instruments with varying maturity dates and is expected to be utilised at varying amounts over the next 23 years and has been discounted.
The provision for joint venture liabilities represents the aggregate amount of net liabilities in joint ventures at the balance sheet date.
The amounts have been transferred from investments in order to separate the gross amounts of investments with net liabilities from those with net assets as prescribed in the accounting policy note c. Movements in the groups share of joint venture assets and liabilities are disclosed in note 17.

33 Share-based payments Equity settled share-based payments All employee Save As You Earn SAYE schemes The group operates a SAYE share option scheme for all employees to encourage participation in the groups results.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the quoted market price of the companys shares on the date of grant less a discount of between 10 and 20 per cent.
The options mature after either three years or five years and there is an exercise period of six months from when the share options become exercisable after which period the options lapse.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2006 2005 Number Number of share of share options options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 5,631,336 6,690,337 Granted during the year 541,520 408,844 Exercised during the year 628,548 879,717 Forfeited during the year 122,829 285,468 Expired during the year 254,739 302,660 Outstanding at the end of the year 5,166,740 5,631,336 Exercisable at the end of the year 1,045,422 226,988 AWG Plc www.

The options outstanding at 31 March 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 4.66 2005: 4.11, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.5 years 2005: 2.2 years.
During the year options were granted on 8 February 2006.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is 1.0 million.
The inputs into the binomial model that the group uses to value share options were: 2006 2006 2005 2005 3 year 5 year 3 year 5 year Share price at date of grant 1060p 1060p 824.5p 824.5p Exercise price 954p 954p 742p 742p Expected volatility 21.1% 24.5% 25.6% 30.9% Expected life 3.5 years 5.5 years 3.5 years 5.5 years Risk free rate 4.3% 4.3% 4.5% 4.5% Expected dividend yield 4.6% 4.6% 6.1% 6.1% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility for a period up to the date of grant equal to the length of the expected life of the options.
Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS The group also operated an ESOS from 2001 to 2003, which was then replaced by an LTIP see below.
The participants in the ESOS were the Executive Directors and a number of senior managers.
Options are exercisable at a price equal to the quoted market price of the companys shares on the date of grant.
The vesting period is three years and there is then a further exercise period of seven years from when the share options become exercisable after which period the options lapse.
Vesting is subject to achieving EPS growth over a three year period, subject to retesting in years four and five if vesting has not been achieved.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 2006 2005 Number Number of share of share options options Outstanding at the beginning of the year 3,743,518 4,763,122 Exercised during the year 32,342 Forfeited during the year 2,250,837 987,262 Outstanding at the end of the year 1,492,681 3,743,518 Exercisable at the end of the year The options outstanding at 31 March 2006 had a weighted average exercise price of 5.39 2005: 5.34, and a weighted average remaining contractual life of 0.3 years 2005: 0.8 years.
No options were granted during the year or the preceding year under the ESOS.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 108 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 33 Share-based payments continued Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP In 2004 the group replaced the ESOS with an LTIP which was approved at the 2004 AGM.
Under this plan, Directors and senior managers may receive, at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annual awards of shares that are subject to performance conditions.
Details of the share awards outstanding during the year are as follows: 2006 2005 Number Number of share of share awards awards Outstanding at the beginning of the year 353,475 Awarded during the year 267,151 380,952 Forfeited during the year 28,276 27,477 Outstanding at the end of the year 592,350 353,475 The awards outstanding at 31 March 2006 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of 1.8 years 2005: 2.3 years.
During the year awards were made on 3 June 2005, 30 August 2005 and 24 November 2005.
The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the shares awarded on those dates is 2.4 million.
The proportion of the LTIP shares awarded during the year ended 31 March 2005 that will vest is dependent on the companys performance relative to a comparator index of companies in terms of total shareholder return TSR over a threeyear period.
Valuation of these share awards was based on the total value of the shares awarded and an expectation of the number likely to vest based on statistical sampling.
The proportion of the LTIP shares awarded during the year ended 31 March 2006 that will vest depends 60 per cent on the companys performance relative to a comparator index of companies in terms of TSR and 40 per cent on its performance in terms of EPS over a three-year period.
Valuation for the TSR element is as above and valuation for the EPS element is based on inputs into a binomial model.
The inputs used for the statistical sampling were as follows: 2006 2005 Share price at date of grant 906p 613p Mean TSR over three years up to date of award 26.2% 11.3% Standard deviation of comparator group 0.09 0.03 Expected life 3 years 3 years Expected number of awards to vest under market based vesting condition 41% 31% The inputs into the binomial model that the group uses to value share awards were as follows: 2006 2005 Share price at date of grant 906p Exercise price Expected volatility 25.2% Expected life 3 years Risk free rate 4.5% Expected dividend yield 5.5% Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility for a period up to the date of award equal to the length of the expected life of the awards.
com 109 34 Contingencies The group has entered into a number of performance bonding and guarantee arrangements in the normal course of business.
Provision is made for any amounts that the Directors consider may become payable under such arrangements.
The group has also guaranteed obligations of joint ventures and associates totalling 31.8 million 2005: 43.1 million.
The group has entered into a variety of restructuring and re-nancing initiatives over time to optimise the efficiency of its balance sheet and organisation in order to create value for customers and shareholders.
Extensive professional advice has been taken which supports the view that all group restructurings have been correctly treated for accounting and tax purposes and therefore, since any risk here is very low no provisions for tax liabilities are considered to be necessary.
At 31 March 2006 the group had 137.0 million 2005: 149.8 million of recoverable ACT, subject to this contingency, recorded in the balance sheet.
This ACT is expected to be recovered in full over time and therefore no provision is considered appropriate in respect of this asset.
35 Capital commitments The group has a substantial long-term investment programme in Anglian Water, which includes expenditure to meet regulatory requirements, shortfalls in performance and condition, and to provide for new demand and growth.

Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 112 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Transition to IFRS This is the first year that the group has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 31 March 2005.
The groups date of transition to IFRS is 1 April 2004 and all comparative information in these financial statements has been restated to reect the groups adoption of IFRS, except where otherwise required or permitted by IFRS 1.
IFRS 1 requires that IFRS is applied retrospectively to establish the groups balance sheet at the date of transition, 1 April 2004, unless a specic exemption is applied.
In preparing this IFRS information, the group has adopted the following exemptions: To elect not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to past business combinations that occurred before the date of transition to IFRS.
To apply IFRS 2 Share-based Payments only to those share options granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 April 2004.
To deem cumulative translation differences for all foreign operations to be zero as at the transition IFRS balance sheet date.
To recognise in full all actuarial gains and losses relating to dened benefit pension schemes at the date of transition to IFRS.
In addition, the group has chosen to adopt IAS 32 and IAS 39 at its date of transition and to apply hedge accounting when the requirements of IAS 39 are met.
The analysis below shows a reconciliation of net assets and profit as reported under UK GAAP at 31 March 2005 to the revised net assets and profit under IFRS reported in these consolidated financial statements.

com 115 Notes to the reconciliations i Fixed Assets Infrastructure Accounting IAS 16 Material Differences to UK GAAP The most material impact of IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment relates to the accounting for water and wastewater infrastructure assets within the groups licensed utility operations.
Under UK GAAP, these assets were accounted for in accordance with the renewals accounting paragraphs of FRS 15 Tangible Fixed Assets.
Such provisions are not present within IAS 16 and it is therefore necessary to change the way in which the assets are accounted for on transition to IFRS.
Under renewals accounting as permitted by FRS 15, the water and wastewater infrastructure networks are assumed to be single assets and the depreciation charged is the estimated level of annual expenditure required to maintain the operating capability of the networks.
Actual expenditure is then capitalised as incurred.
Renewals accounting is not permitted under IAS 16.
The carrying value of infrastructure assets has therefore been recalculated back to privatisation in 1989, as if infrastructure renewals accounting had never been adopted.
Under IFRS, infrastructure expenditure that meets the recognition criteria for property, plant and equipment has been capitalised at cost and depreciated over its expected life.
Expenditure relating to repair or maintenance has been expensed.
Infrastructure grants and contractor contributions previously presented as deductions from infrastructure cost under UK GAAP have been allocated to deferred income and amortised over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
There are no significant differences between UK GAAP and IFRS in respect of all other xed assets, including water and wastewater non-infrastructure assets, other than the separate classication of certain assets as intangibles rather than tangible assets.
Impact No individual main, sewer or other element of the water and wastewater network forms a significant part of the whole.
Accordingly assets have been grouped by type, and depreciated over their estimated useful life ranging from 50 to 160 years.
Recalculating the carrying value of infrastructure assets under IFRS has resulted in an increase in net assets, after tax, of 92.2 million as at March 2005.
In the year ended 31 March 2005, under IFRS, the annual depreciation charge of infrastructure assets plus the maintenance costs expensed exceeded the total of renewals expenditure to maintain operational capacity under UK GAAP by 0.5 million.
ii Capitalisation of Interest IAS 23 Material Differences to UK GAAP Under UK GAAP, borrowing costs were fully expensed as incurred.
The group has chosen under IFRS to capitalise that element of borrowing costs incurred for the construction of qualifying tangible and intangible xed assets.
The change in policy under IFRS is applied retrospectively.
Under IFRS the group capitalises the borrowing costs incurred for the construction of any qualifying assets during the period of time that is required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use.
Impact Under IFRS net assets were 198.0 million higher after tax as at March 2005 and profit before tax higher by 1.3 million.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 116 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Transition to IFRS continued iii Dened benefit Pension Scheme Accounting IAS 19 Material Differences to UK GAAP The group prepared its 2005 UK GAAP results in accordance with SSAP 24 Accounting for Pension Costs, with FRS 17 Retirement Benets transitional disclosures provided in the notes to the accounts.
FRS 17 became fully effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005.
The group did not adopt FRS 17 for its consolidated financial statements but instead moved directly to IAS 19 Employee Benets.
Under SSAP 24, any pension scheme surplus or deficit identied at the most recent actuarial valuation is recognised gradually through the profit and loss account over the average expected future working lifetime of current employees.
The net pension cost under SSAP 24 therefore includes both the cost of providing an additional year of pension benets to employees regular cost and an element of the surplus or deficit relating to previous years variation.
The difference between employers contributions paid and the SSAP 24 net pension cost is recognised as a prepayment or accrual, resulting in a balance sheet position that does not necessarily reect the actuarial position.
Interest is calculated on this balance sheet entry and is also included within the net pension cost.
In accordance with IAS 19, legal and constructive obligations for post employment benefit schemes including pensions are recognised on the balance sheet.
The group has chosen to adopt the amendments to IAS 19, issued by the IASB in December 2004, in advance of their effective date of 1 January 2006.
Thus where actual experience differs from the assumptions made at the start of a financial year, actuarial gains and losses will be recognised in full through the statement of recognised income and expense.
The group operates a number of dened benefit pension schemes, which are independent of the groups nances, for the majority of its employees.
Under UK GAAP actuarial valuations of the schemes are carried out as determined by the pension scheme trustees at intervals of not more than three years, the rates of contribution payable and the pension cost being determined on the advice of the actuaries, having regard to the results of these valuations.
In any intervening years, the actuaries review the continuing appropriateness of the contribution rates.
Under IFRS, dened benefit assets are measured annually at fair value while liabilities are measured at present value.
The difference between the two amounts is recognised as an asset or liability in the balance sheet.
The cost of providing pension benets to employees relating to the current years service is included in the income statement within other operating costs, whilst the difference between the expected return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is included within finance costs.
All actuarial gains and losses as at 1 April 2004, the date of transition to IFRS, were recognised in full.
All future actuarial gains and losses are recognised outside the income statement in retained earnings and presented in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Impact The adoption of IAS 19 reduced the 2005 profit before tax by 14.7 million compared to the previously published financial statements, representing reduced operating profits of 13.8 million and increased finance costs of 0.9 million.
The fide-recognition of the SSAP 24 prepayment and unfunded pension provision reduced net assets by 41.7 million net of tax as at 31 March 2005.
Total shareholders equity was then further reduced by the recognition of the IAS 19 deficit of 148.5 million, and minority interests are reduced by 3.0 million.
com 117 iv Deferred Tax IAS 12 Material Differences to UK GAAP FRS 19 Deferred Tax permits, but does not require, deferred tax assets or liabilities to be discounted and as a result the group chose to discount its net deferred tax liability.
However, IAS 12 Income Taxes does not permit discounting of deferred tax in any circumstances.
This is of particular signicance to a capital intensive utility business, such as AWG, where any reversal of timing differences is likely to be deferred long into the future due to the long asset lives of network assets.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, on all temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Impact The prohibition of discounting deferred tax liabilities resulted in an increase in the balance sheet deferred tax liability of 491.3 million at 31 March 2005 and a corresponding reduction in net assets.
In addition, the deferred tax effect on each of the other IFRS adjustments to the balance sheet were recognised, the most significant of which related to pensions 82.9 million deferred tax asset, capitalised interest 84.9 million deferred tax liability, and financial instruments 15.8 million deferred tax asset.
v Financial Instruments Accounting for Derivatives IAS 39 Material Differences to UK GAAP Under UK GAAP, debt is carried at its hedged amount and the fair values of derivatives are not recognised in the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the default treatment is for debt to be carried at amortised cost, whilst derivatives are recognised separately on the balance sheet at fair value with movements in those fair values reected through the income statement.
This has the potential to introduce non-cash volatility to both the income statement and balance sheet.
Therefore, for fair value hedges, IAS 39 allows changes in the recognised value of hedged debt that are attributable to the hedged risk to be adjusted through the income statement.
This is only permitted where the hedge and debt is considered to meet the hedge accounting criteria dened by IAS 39.
In the case of cash ow hedges, movements in the fair value of derivatives are deferred within reserves until they can be recycled through the income statement to match the future income statement effect of changes in the hedged risk.
In order to apply this treatment, it must be demonstrated that the derivative has been and will continue to be an effective hedge of the hedged risk within the underlying asset or liability.
Any hedge ineffectiveness, provided it is within the range deemed acceptable by IAS 39, is recognised immediately within the income statement.
Interest rate swap agreements are used to manage interest rate exposure, while the group enters into foreign exchange contracts and foreign exchange options to manage its exposure to uctuations in currency rates.
All financial derivatives are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value.
Hedge accounting is applied where possible.
Therefore, where derivatives that are designated as fair value hedges meet the hedge effectiveness criteria specified in IAS 39, changes in the recognised value of hedged debt that are attributable to the hedged risk are adjusted through the income statement to offset changes in the fair value of derivatives.
For qualifying cash ow hedges, the fair value gain or loss associated with the effective portion of the cash ow hedge is recognised initially directly in shareholders equity, and released to the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss.
Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Accounts 118 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Transition to IFRS continued Where changes in the fair value of a derivative differ to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in the income statement.
New borrowings are stated at net proceeds received after the deduction of issue costs.
Under UK GAAP the issue costs of debt instruments are amortised at a constant rate over the life of the instrument, whereas under IFRS the costs are amortised using the effective interest rate method.
Impact As a result of applying IAS 39, there was a non-cash charge to the income statement of 17.5 million for the year ended 31 March 2005.
This primarily related to RPI swaps, which although economically highly effective, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the strict denition of IAS 39.
This means that there is the potential for future volatility through the income statement on these instruments although this will ultimately net to match the cumulative accounting impact under UK GAAP when the instrument matures.
The majority of the groups other derivatives currently qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39.
The overall reduction in net assets as at 31 March 2005 as result of derivative accounting is 54.0 million before tax.
vi Redeemable shares Material Differences to UK GAAP Under IFRS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Presentation, redeemable shares where the holder has the option of redemption are classied as liabilities rather than equity.
Impact The redeemable shares at March 2005 of 14.7 million were reclassied from share capital to non-current liabilities.
The net assets of the group were correspondingly reduced and this is shown in the Other column of the balance sheet reconciliation.
These redeemable shares were all subsequently redeemed in October 2005. vii Other differences All other differences between IFRS and UK GAAP are included within the Other column.
The main such adjustments are: The impact of fair valuing share options granted after 7 November 2002 in accordance with IFRS 2.
The reclassication of software costs from tangible to intangible xed assets in accordance with IAS 38.
The reclassication of long-term contract balances in accordance with IAS 11 Construction Contracts.
Debtors due after one year, included within current assets under UK GAAP are reclassied within non-current assets under IFRS.
Amended depreciation and amortisation resulting from the application of IAS 36.
The deferred tax impacts of all other adjustments.
viii Group cash ow statement The group cash ow statement prepared in accordance with FRS 1 revised presents substantially the same information as that required under IFRS.
However, under IFRS there are certain differences from UK GAAP with regard to the classication of items within the cash ow statement and with regard to the denition of cash and cash equivalents.
Under UK GAAP, cash ows are presented separately for operating activities, returns on investments and servicing of finance, taxation, capital expenditure and financial investment, equity dividend paid, management of liquid resources and nancing.
Under IFRS, only three categories of cash ow activity are reported: operating activities, investing activities and nancing activities.
Under IFRS, items which under UK GAAP would be included within management of liquid resources fall within the denition of cash and cash equivalents.
