The relative ownership of these preference shares has resulted in a realignment of balances between NV and PLC.
b From 1 January 2005, Unilever adopted IAS 32 which requires preference shares that provide for a xed preference dividend to be classied as borrowings and preference dividends to be recognised in the income statement.
In accordance with the transition rules for IAS 32, 2004 was not restated.
c The share-based compensation credit relates to the reversal of the non-cash charge recorded against operating profit in respect of the fair value of share options and awards granted to employees.
d As part of the review of Unilever's corporate structure, and in the light of the constitutional and operational arrangements which enable Unilever N. V. and Unilever PLC to operate as nearly as practicable as a single company, the Directors have been authorised to take any action necessary or desirable in order to ensure that the ratio of the dividend generating capacity of Unilever PLC to that of Unilever N. V. does not differ substantially from the ratio of the dividend entitlement of ordinary shareholders in Unilever PLC to that of ordinary shareholders in Unilever N. V. Therefore, in 2006, shareholdings in the Unilever companies in Czech Republic, Hungary, Russia and Turkey, as well as a part of indirect shareholdings in Unilever US, have been transferred from Unilever N. V. to Unilever PLC for no consideration.
In addition, part of a dividend which would otherwise be due from a Unilever US intermediate company to a company within the Unilever N. V. part of the Group has instead been paid to a company within the Unilever PLC part of the Group.
Re-organisations of group companies have produced similar types of adjustments in previous years.
Cumulative goodwill written off directly to reserves prior to the transition to IFRS on 1 January 2004 was 5 199 million for NV and 2 063 million for PLC.
