Notes to the Company accounts A.
ACCOUNTING POLICIES Although the consolidated group accounts are prepared under IFRS, the Hammerson plc company accounts presented in this section are prepared under UK GAAP.
The accounting policies relevant to the Company are the same as those set out in the accounting policies for the group in note 1, except as set out below.
In 2006, the Company changed its accounting policy to include its investment in subsidiaries at valuation, rather than at cost less provision for impairment, to better reflect their underlying value.
The Directors determine the valuations with reference to the underlying net assets of the subsidiaries.
Provisions for impairment below cost are taken to the income statement.
Surpluses arising on valuations above cost are included in the revaluation reserve.
In accordance with UK GAAP, in calculating the underlying net asset values of the subsidiaries, no deduction is made for deferred tax relating to revaluation surpluses on investment properties.
Investments in subsidiaries had previously included loans to subsidiaries.
These loans have now been reclassified as non-current asset receivables.
The difference between the carrying value and the cost of investment in shares of subsidiaries as previously reported has been credited to the revaluation reserve.
A prior year adjustment has been made to increase equity shareholders funds as at 31 December 2005 by 2,187.9 million.
There is no impact on the reported result for 2005 or 2006.
The effects of these accounting changes are set out in notes C, D and H. B.
