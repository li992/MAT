The relevant constituent of this goodwill would be charged or credited to the profit and loss account should the related acquisitions be sold.
There are no cash generating units for which the carrying value of goodwill is significant in comparison with the total carrying value of goodwill.
The impairment review for all goodwill was based on cash flows developed using the most recent budget, three year plan and forecast for each cash generating unit and took account of past experience.
In each case the cost of capital was taken to be 4.75% and annual growth rates ranged between 0% and 25%.
In no cases were projections made more than seven years ahead and projected rates fall significantly in later years due to their uncertainty.
Management does not believe that a change in assumptions would cause the aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill to exceed the aggregate of their recoverable amounts, without the change being accompanied by a significant loss event.
