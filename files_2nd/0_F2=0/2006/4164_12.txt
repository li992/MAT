Investment properties 2006 2005 m m Investment properties 3.1 0.7 During 2005 and 2006, the group operated an 'Easybuy' scheme, under which 25% of the purchase price of selected properties was funded through a loan from the group, secured on the property.
The group retains a 25% interest in the market value of the property.
These loans are repayable at 25% of the market value of the property upon sale or transfer of ownership of the property or within 10 years, whichever is sooner.
The purchaser also has an option to repay the loan earlier than would otherwise be required, subject to a market valuation of the property.
Investment properties are held at fair value.
The Directors believe that there is sufficient relevant expertise within the group to perform the fair valuation exercise.
Sales under the Easybuy scheme were recorded at 75% of the purchase price, with a corresponding proportional transfer from inventory to cost of sales.
Costs in respect of the 25% of the purchase price funded by the group's loan were transferred from inventory to investment properties, pending repayment of the loans.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 57 21.
Financial instruments group operations are financed through a combination of shareholders funds and net borrowings, comprising bank and loan facilities.
The core element of the groups borrowing requirement is provided by long term fixed interest loan notes.
The group has limited its use of financial instruments to derivatives designed to protect the group from fluctuations in interest and exchange rates.
The remaining borrowing requirement is funded principally through a revolving credit facility with variable interest rates.
This policy has remained in force during the year ended 31st October 2006.

The fixed rate financial liabilities are at a weighted average of 8.04% 2005: 8.04% fixed for an average of 3.6 years 2005: 4.6 years.
The preference shares were redeemed on 2nd November 2005.
The floating rate financial liabilities are subject to interest rates referenced to LIBOR.
These rates are for a period between one and twelve months.
For financial liabilities which have no interest payable but for which imputed interest is charged, consisting of land payables, the weighted average period to maturity is 20 months 2005: 16 months.
The discount rate applied is equivalent to the group's current incremental borrowing rate.
There are no other material differences between book value and fair value of the groups financial assets and liabilities.

CREDIT RISK The maximum exposure to credit risk at both 31st October 2006 and 31st October 2005 is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet.
The group has no substantial exposure to any individual third party.
CURRENCY RISK All US senior loan notes denominated in US dollars were swapped into sterling on issue.
The group has no other significant foreign currency dealings.
After taking account of currency swaps, the group had no exposure to currency fluctuations as at 31st October 2006 2005: nil.
FAIR VALUES Financial assets The carrying amount of financial assets equates to their fair value.
Financial liabilities The fair value of the senior loan notes and their related hedging instruments is determined by discounting risk-adjusted expected future cash flows with application of current market foreign exchange rates.
The carrying amount of the remaining financial liabilities equates to their fair value.
Land purchased on extended payment terms When land is purchased on extended payment terms, the group initially records it at its fair value with a land payable recorded for any outstanding monies based on its fair value assessment.
Fair value is determined by using the effective interest method.
The difference between the nominal value and the initial fair value is amortised over the period of the extended credit term and charged to finance costs, increasing the value of the land payable such that at the date of maturity the land payable equals the payment required.
Financial assets Financial assets of the group at 31st October 2006 consisted of sterling cash deposits of 29.3m 2005: 57.0m placed overnight, with solicitors and on current account.
Undrawn borrowing facilities The group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities of 189.6m at 31st October 2006 2005: 176.1m.
The repayment terms of the facilities are set out in Note 15.
In addition there were undrawn guarantee and bonding facilities of 45.8m 2005: 39.6m.
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 59 22.
Employee benefits RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Defined contribution scheme The group operates a defined contribution scheme for new employees.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group in an independently administered fund.
The service cost of this scheme for the year was 0.6m 2005: 0.6m.
At the balance sheet date there were no outstanding or prepaid contributions 2005: nil.
Defined benefit scheme The group operates a contributory defined benefit pension scheme which is closed to new entrants.
The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the group, being invested in managed funds.
The most recent funding valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1st February 2004 by a professionally qualified actuary using the attained age method.
The assets of the defined benefit scheme have been calculated at fair value and the liabilities, at each balance sheet date under IAS 19 Revised, using the projected unit method and based on the following financial assumptions: 31st October 31st October 2006 2005 %pa %pa Discount rate 5.00% 5.00% Salary escalation 4.00% 3.90% Price inflation 3.20% 2.90% Pension increases on benefit increasing in line with 5% or RPI if lower 2.80% 2.60% Expected return on invested assets 7.00% 7.00% Expected return on insurance annuity contracts 5.00% 5.00% The expected return on assets reflects the weighted average return on the categories of scheme assets shown below.

SHARE BASED PAYMENTS The group operates a number of share option plans, which are summarised below and described in more detail on pages 27-28.
In accordance with IFRS 2, only costs relating to options issued after 7th November 2002 and not vested at 1st November 2004 have been charged to the income statement.
The group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, which results in share based payment.
Vesting of the LTIP options is dependent on certain performance conditions, which are set out on page 29.
These conditions have been factored into the option value applied.
In addition, the group operates executive share option schemes.
Vesting of options under this scheme are also dependent on performance criteria, as set out on pages 27-28.
The group provides a Save As You Earn SAYE scheme open to all employees, subject to HMRC restrictions and a minimum qualifying period of employment.
There are no performance conditions governing the exercise of SAYE options.
The group also operates a Share Incentive Plan, the details of which are set out on page 28 and for which there are no performance conditions.
Share options have been valued by an external third party using the binomial option-pricing model, based on publicly available market data at the time of grant, which the Directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

Related party transactions The group has entered into related party transactions with joint ventures, which are disclosed in Note 10.
The group has provided the services of a Customer Service manager to a joint venture, which have been recharged at cost.
Accounting estimates and judgements Management considers the key estimates and judgements made in the accounts to be related to the valuation of work in progress and of pension liabilities.
CARRYING VALUE OF LAND AND WORK IN PROGRESS Inventories of land, work in progress and completed units are stated in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Due to the nature of development activity and in particular, the length of the development cycle, the group has to allocate site-wide development costs such as infrastructure between units being built and or completed in the current year and those for future years.
It also has to make estimates of the cost to complete such developments.
There is a degree of inherent uncertainty in making such estimates.
The group has established internal controls that are designed to ensure an effective assessment is made of inventory carrying values and the costs to complete developments.
PENSIONS Management has employed the services of an actuary in setting these estimates: however, they recognise the risk that both expected investment returns and ultimate scheme payments may differ substantially from current forecasts.
Transition to adopted IFRSs As stated in Note 1, these are the groups first consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRSs.
The accounting policies set out in Note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 31st October 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 31st October 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1st November 2004 the groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the group has adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its old basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to Adopted IFRSs has affected the groups financial position, financial performance and cash flows is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.
