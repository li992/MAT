The fair value of publicly traded borrowings has been calculated using the appropriate market prices at the balance sheet date.
For the borrowings which are not publicly traded, the fair value has been calculated by discounting their future cash flows at the appropriate market rate.
The Directors estimate the fair value of the Companys borrowings to be as follows: Book value Fair value 2006 2005 2006 2005 Restated m m m m 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 323.1 322.1 348.0 349.9 425m 8.625% senior notes 300.0 301.6 368.1 347.0 Long-term committed facilities 1.5 1.9 1.5 1.9 621.6 621.8 714.6 695.0 Year ended 31 March 2006 Current Effective Within 1 year 1 2 years 2 3 years 3 4 years 4 5 years More than coupon rate interest rate 5 years Total m m m m m m m Non-current 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 9.75% 9.92% 323.1 323.1 425m 8.625% senior notes 8.625% 8.94% 300.0 300.0 Long-term committed facilities 1.5 1.5 323.1 1.5 300.0 621.6 Current Total borrowings 323.1 1.5 300.0 621.6 Year ended 31 March 2005 Current Effective Within 1 year 1 2 years 2 3 years 3 4 years 4 5 years More than Total coupon rate interest rate 5 years Restated m m m m m m m Non-current 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds 9.75% 9.92% 322.1 322.1 425m 8.625% senior notes 8.625% 8.94% 301.6 301.6 Long-term committed facilities 1.9 1.9 1.9 322.1 301.6 621.8 Current Total borrowings 1.9 322.1 301.6 621.8 In July 2005, the Group signed a new 450m revolving credit facility with a group of banks.
This facility replaced a revolving credit facility 250m, a 364 day facility 100m and enabled a subsidiary to repay the US$123.8m 6.96% senior notes.
In addition, two bilateral facilities 40m were not renewed.
This resulted in exceptional refinancing costs of 5.2m 2005: nil of which 3.5m was in respect of issue and repayment costs of the US$123.8m 6.96% senior notes and 1.7m in respect of issue costs relating to the 250m revolving credit facility.
On 11 March 2003, Moodys Investor Service downgraded the Groups credit rating from Baa2 to Ba1.
As a consequence, the coupon of the 325m 8.25% Sterling bonds was increased from 8.25% to 9.75% with effect from 20 May 2003.
The Company holds equivalent Euro nominal value interest rate swaps matching the coupon and the term of the 425m 8.625% senior notes effectively converting the interest basis of the issue to floating rate set in arrears.
Under their banking arrangements, overdraft and cash balances of the Company and of certain subsidiaries are pooled or offset and cross-guaranteed.
Such pooling and offsets are reflected in the Company balance sheet as appropriate.
