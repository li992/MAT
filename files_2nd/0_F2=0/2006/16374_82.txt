Legal provisions are comprised of many claims, of which none is individually material.
Unilever announced on 8 November 2006 that it had agreed a settlement with the main parties in the legal dispute over its 1999 Unilever N. V. preference shares.
The terms of the agreement are that NV will pay an amount of 1.38 plus interest of 0.16 compensation per preference share held at the beginning of 24 March 2004, the day on which NV announced its intention to convert the preference shares into NV ordinary shares.
NV also agreed to reimburse the parties who initiated the Enterprise Chamber procedure for costs and expenses.
On 19 January 2007 NV announced that the settlement offer will be extended to all those other former preference shareholders who held preference shares at the beginning of 24 March 2004.
Unilever has provided 300 million in respect of the settlement.
The provision for disputed indirect taxes is comprised of a number of small disputed items.
The largest elements of the provision relate to disputes with the Brazilian authorities.
Because of the nature of the disputes, the timing of the utilisation of the provisions, and any associated cash outows, is uncertain.
The majority of the disputed items attract an interest charge.
No individual item within the other provisions balance is significant.
Unilever expects that the issues relating to these restructuring, legal and other provisions will be substantively resolved over the next five years.
