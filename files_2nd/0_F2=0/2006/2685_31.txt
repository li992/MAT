Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2006 1 Statement of accounting policies 1.1 Basis of preparation The Companys financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting standards applicable under generally accepted accounting principles in the UK and the provisions of the Companies Act, and on the historical cost basis where appropriate, except for the revaluation of investments in subsidiaries.
These financial statements set out the position of the Company and not Cable & Wireless Group the Group which it heads.
1.2 New accounting standards The following Accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items that are considered material in relation to the Companys financial statements except as noted below.
The Company has adopted FRS 17 Retirement benefits, FRS 20 Accounting for share-based payments, FRS 21 Events after the balance sheet date, FRS 22 Earnings per share not applicable to the Company, FRS 23 The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates, FRS 24 Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies, FRS 25 Financial instruments: Disclosure and presentation, FRS 26 Financial instruments: Measurement.
The comparative figures have been restated where applicable.
The adoption of FRS 17 resulted in a prior year adjustment of 141 million reducing opening equity shareholders funds 2004 103 million.
The adoption of FRS 20 resulted in a charge in the years ended 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2006 in respect of share based payments of 5 million and 5 million respectively.
There was no impact on the opening balance sheet.
The adoption of FRS 21 changed the timing of the recognition of dividends from the period to which the dividend related to the point at which the dividend becomes payable.
A prior year adjustment of 60 million has been reflected in the opening balance sheet at 1 April 2005 2004 73 million.
The adoption of FRS 23 and FRS 24 has no impact on these financial statements.
The adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 requires substantial additional disclosures and the reclassification and re-measurement of certain of the Companys assets and liabilities.
As permitted under the transitional arrangements for the implementation of these standards, the Company has adopted FRS 25 and FRS 26 from 1 April 2005.
A reconciliation of the balance sheet at 31 March 2005 to 1 April 2005 is set out in note 20.
1.3 Use of estimates The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
Actual results could differ from these estimates.
FRS 18 Accounting policies requires that a description of the impact of any change in estimation techniques should be provided where the change has a material impact on the reported results for the period.
1.4 Tangible fixed assets and depreciation Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less depreciation.
The cost of fixed assets includes directly attributable labour and overhead costs.
Interest incurred up to the time that separately identifiable major capital projects are ready for service is also capitalised as part of the cost of assets.
Where the Company has a legal or constructive obligation to dismantle and remove its assets and restore the relevant sites, a provision is made for the estimated costs of the asset retirement obligation.
The present value of the asset retirement obligation is capitalised as part of the initial cost of the asset.
Depreciation is not provided on freehold land or projects under construction.
On other tangible fixed assets, depreciation is provided on the difference between the cost of tangible fixed assets and the estimated residual value, in equal annual instalments over the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Depreciation commences when the assets are ready for use.
These lives are: Lives Plant and equipment 3 to 10 years Freehold buildings 40 years Leasehold land and buildings up to 40 years or term of lease if less Profits and losses on disposals of tangible fixed assets are determined by reference to sale proceeds and net book values.
2005 06 Annual report 147 Individual financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2006 1.5 Asset impairment Intangible and tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the fixed asset may not be recoverable.
Where an impairment indicator is identified, the carrying value of the income-generating unit is compared with its recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value an impairment is recognised.
1.6 Investments in subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates Investments in subsidiaries are included in the balance sheet at valuation.
Investments in joint ventures and associates are included in the balance sheet at cost.
1.7 Financial investments a From 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 Listed and unlisted securities are carried at purchase price net of any diminution in value that is expected to be permanent.
Any diminution in value is charged to profit.
b From 1 April 2005 The Company classifies its investments into the following categories: financial assets at fair value through profit and loss, loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investments, and available for sale financial assets.
The classification depends on the purpose for which the investments were acquired.
Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date.
Financial assets at fair value through profit and loss This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and those designated at fair value through profit and loss at inception.
A financial asset is classified in this category if acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the short-term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives are also categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges.
Assets in this category are classified as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within one year of the balance sheet date.
Originated loans and receivables Originated loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market.
They arise when the Company provides money, goods or services directly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable.
They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than one year after the balance sheet date: these are classified as non-current assets.
Loans and receivables are included in trade and other receivables in the balance sheet.
Held-to-maturity investments Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturities that the Companys management has the positive intention and ability to hold to maturity.
Available for sale financial assets Available for sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories.
They are included in non-current assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within one year of the balance sheet date.
Purchases and sales of investments are recognised on trade-date the date on which the Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Investments are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs for all financial assets not carried at fair value through profit and loss.
Investments are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the investments have expired or have been transferred and the Company has transferred substantially all risks and rewards of ownership.
Available for sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit and loss are subsequently carried at fair value.
Loans and receivables and held-to-maturity investments are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Realised and unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets at fair value through profit and loss category are included in the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of non-monetary securities classified as available for sale are recognised in equity.
When securities classified as available for sale are sold or impaired, the accumulated fair value adjustments are included in the profit and loss account as gains and losses from investment securities.
The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices.
If the market for a financial asset is not active and for unlisted securities, the Company establishes fair value by using valuation techniques.
These include the use of recent arms length transactions, reference to other instruments that are substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis, and option pricing models refined to reflect the issuers specific circumstances.
The Company assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired.
In the case of equity securities classified as available for sale, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered in determining whether the securities are impaired.
If any such evidence exists for available for sale financial assets, the cumulative loss measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profit and 148 2005 06 Annual report loss is removed from equity and recognised in the profit and loss account.
Impairment losses recognised in the profit and loss account on equity instruments are not reversed through the profit and loss account.
1.8 Tax The charge for tax is based on the result for the year and takes into account tax deferred due to timing differences between the treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are regarded as recoverable.
Deferred tax assets are regarded as recoverable to the extent that on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Except where otherwise required by accounting standards, full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date.
1.9 Pensions The Company is a member of the Groups defined benefit pension scheme but is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and reasonable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17 accounts for the scheme as if it were a defined contribution scheme.
As a result, the amount charged to the Companys profit and loss account represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the accounting period.
The Company also operates an unfunded pension plan to cover the costs of former Directors and other senior employees pension entitlements.
Provision is made in the Companys financial statements for the expected costs of meeting the associated liabilities.
Costs in respect of the Companys defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis as contributions become payable.
1.10 Employee share schemes The cost of awards to employees that take the form of shares or rights to shares are recognised over the period of the employees related performance.
Where there are no performance criteria, the cost is recognised when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled to the shares.
1.11 Borrowings a From 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 Borrowings are recognised initially at the proceeds received from the borrowing agreement, net of any related issue costs.
Those issue costs are amortised into the profit and loss account over the life of the instrument using the effective interest method.
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least one year after the balance sheet date.
b From 1 April 2005 Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred.
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost: any difference between the proceeds net of transaction costs and the redemption value is recognised in the profit and loss account over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Where the terms of a borrowing arrangement contain a separable embedded derivative, the initial values of the debt component and the derivative component s are determined using the appropriate fair value calculations.
The liability portion is recorded on an amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or maturity of the bonds.
If the conversion option is a derivative it is accounted for as such.
Where the conversion option is considered to be equity, it is recognised and included in shareholders equity, net of income tax effects.
1.12 Trade and other receivables a From 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 Trade and other receivables are carried at the original invoice amount to customers less provision made for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts.
Bad debts are written off through the profit and loss account when identified.
b From 1 April 2005 Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Company will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables.
The amount of the provision is the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate.
The amount of the provision is recognised in the profit and loss account.
2005 06 Annual report 149 Individual financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2006 1.13 Financial instruments a From 1 April 2004 to 31 March 2005 Swaps and forward rate agreements The net interest paid or received under any interest rate and cross currency swaps and forward rate agreements FRAs is recorded on an accruals basis and included within net financing cost in the profit and loss account.
The notional amounts of interest rate swaps and FRAs are not recorded on the balance sheet.
Cross currency swaps are used to hedge the initial draw down and final repayment of certain foreign currency denominated debt, and the related foreign currency interest flows.
Forward exchange contracts Forward exchange contracts are carried on the balance sheet at the difference between the amounts of the payable and receivable currency revalued at the closing exchange rate.
The interest differential, being the difference between the contract rate and the spot rate on the date of entering into the forward exchange contract, is charged to the profit and loss account as interest over the life of the contract.
Exchange gains and losses Exchange gains and losses on revaluation and maturity of any forward exchange contracts and cross currency swaps are treated according to the underlying exposure they hedge: for any contracts that hedge firm third party commitments the exchange gains and losses are recognised in the profit and loss account in the same period as the underlying transaction: for any contracts over underlying currency assets or liabilities the exchange gains and losses are offset against the equal and opposite exchange gains or losses arising on the retranslation of the underlying assets or liabilities: for any contracts taken out to hedge overseas equity investments the exchange gains and losses are taken to reserves to offset against the exchange differences arising on the retranslation of the net assets of the investments on consolidation: and for any contracts that hedge general trading flows the exchange gains or losses are taken to the profit and loss account in the period in which they arise.
Where the underlying exposure changes, or ceases to exist, the contract would be terminated and the exchange gain or loss arising taken to the profit and loss account.
b From 1 April 2005 Derivative financial instruments and associated gains and losses are recognised as balance sheet items and recognised gains losses respectively.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
The Company designates certain derivatives as either: hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment fair value hedge : hedges of highly probable forecast transactions cash flow hedges : or hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Company documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
The Company also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
Fair value hedges Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in the profit and loss account, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges are recognised in equity.
The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the profit and loss account in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss for instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place.
However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-financial asset for example, network or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the profit and loss account.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the profit and loss account.
150 2005 06 Annual report Net investment hedges Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity: the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the profit and loss account when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the profit and loss account.
Fair value estimation The fair value of financial instruments traded in active markets such as publicly traded derivatives, and trading and available for sale securities is based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date.
The quoted market price used for financial assets held by the Company is the current bid price: the appropriate quoted market price for financial liabilities is the current ask price.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determined by using valuation techniques.
The Company uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date.
Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments are used for long-term debt.
Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows.
The fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using forward exchange market rates at the balance sheet date.
The nominal value less estimated credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate their fair values.
The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Company for similar financial instruments.
1.14 Employee Share Ownership Plan ESOP and purchase of own shares by the Company The financial statements of the Company include the assets and related liabilities of the Groups Employee Share Ownership Plan Trust the Trust, which holds shares for the Groups ESOP.
Under the requirements of UITF 38 Accounting for ESOP trusts the shares held by the Trust are stated at cost and deducted from shareholders funds.
Shares purchased by the Company are held as treasury shares at cost and deducted from shareholders funds until they are cancelled, sold for cash or transferred out of treasury pursuant to an employees share scheme.
Treasury shares do not carry voting rights and no dividends will be paid on these shares.

The consideration was made up of 675 million debt repayment, 15 million to acquire the share capital of Chelys Limited and 15 million of direct costs incurred to acquire Energis.
As part of the Energis acquisition, the Company agreed to pay contingent consideration of between nil and a maximum of 80 million.
The amount of contingent consideration is tied to the Companys share price and may be satisfied, at the Companys option, in either cash or shares of the Company.
Payments will be based on a ratio of 1.25 million for every one penny by which the maximum three month volume weighted average Cable & Wireless share price in the third year following completion exceeds the reference price of 135 pence.
Any payments would begin in March 2008, would be payable once a month until December 2008 and will be based upon Cable & Wireless volume weighted average share price for the three months prior to any relevant payment date.
The terms and conditions of the contingent consideration include anti-dilution mechanisms similar to those in the 4% convertible bond issued by Cable & Wireless due 2010.
In addition, in the event of a change of control of the Group, or in the event of its shares ceasing to be admitted to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's market for listed securities, a sum calculated in accordance with the terms of the contingent consideration will be payable in cash within ten business days.
On 11 December 2005, the entire shareholding in Chelys Limited was sold to another Group company at no gain or loss.

These transactions have a similar economic effect to repurchasing the bonds for the period of the investment.
In return for the Company receiving interest on the Credit Linked Notes at rates similar to those payable on the underlying bond, the final redemption to be received by the Company would be less than face value if a credit event as defined in the terms of the notes occurs in respect of Cable and Wireless plc.
154 2005 06 Annual report Reflecting the terms of the underlying bond, credit events in the Credit Linked Notes are as follows: Bankruptcy: Failure to make any payment due under any of its debt obligations, after expiration of any grace period and subject to a threshold of 25 million: and Restructuring of any of its debt subject to a threshold of 25 million.
If a credit event should take place, the counterparties to the Credit Linked Notes are entitled to deliver to Cable and Wireless plc its own bonds or debt obligations with a face value equivalent to that of the Credit Linked Notes, or a cash amount equal to the market value thereof.
b Current asset investments and short-term deposits As at 31 March 2005 the Company held current asset investments and short-term deposits of 1,819 million including 12 million of UK Government Gilts and 80 million of Credit Linked Notes.
A provision of 2 million, reflecting a temporary reduction in value, was held at 31 March 2005.

There is no material difference between the carrying value and fair value of creditors at 31 March 2006.
11 Convertible debt and loans On 1 April 2005, the Company adopted FRS 25 and 26 relating to financial instruments.
The liability component and the derivative features on the Company's convertible bond are separated and measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 25 and FRS 26.
An impact of this adoption has been to reduce the principal value of the convertible bond as at 1 April 2005 by 60 million and recognise a derivative liability of 47 million.
We have applied the exemption which permits non-application of these standards to the comparative figures.
The current year disclosures below have been prepared under FRS 25 and 26.

Subject to Cable & Wireless right to make a cash alternative election, each bond entitles the holder to: i convert the bond into fully paid Ordinary Shares of 25 pence each at the rate of 457.930 Ordinary Shares for each 1,000 held at an initial conversion price of 1.45 per Ordinary Share: and ii to have redeemed the cash settled amount of such bond in accordance with the terms and conditions representing 231.724 Ordinary Shares for each 1,000 held at the initial conversion price of 1.45 per Ordinary Share, at any time prior to 9 July 2010.
Full conversion of the bonds would result in an additional 177,733,748 shares being issued.
In April 2005, the terms of the bond were amended to remove Cable & Wireless right to make a cash alternative election.
After 16 July 2007, if Cable & Wireless share price exceeds an amount calculated in accordance with the terms and conditions for a specified number of days, Cable & Wireless has the right to give not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days notice that it will redeem all unconverted bonds still outstanding on a given date at par plus accrued interest.
If the bonds have not been converted, purchased and cancelled or redeemed by 16 July 2010, they will be redeemed at par on that date.
The finance costs charged in the profit and loss accounts comprise the aggregate of the coupon and the proportion of issue costs that relate to the financial year.
On the adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26 the fair value of the liability component and the equity conversion component was determined on the issue of the bond.

2005 06 Annual report 159 Individual financial statements Notes to the financial statements For the year ended 31 March 2006 17 Pension scheme The Company is a member of a group-wide pension scheme providing benefits based on final pensionable pay.
Because the Company is unable to identify its share of the scheme assets and liabilities on a consistent and reasonable basis, as permitted by FRS 17 Retirement benefits: the scheme has been accounted for in these financial statements as if the scheme was a defined contribution scheme.
The latest full actuarial valuation was carried out as at 31 March 2005 and was updated for FRS 17 purposes to 31 March 2006 by a qualified external independent actuary.
The contribution for the year was 110.8 million 2005 115.7 million.

4 The Company holds an economic interest of 55% in Monaco Telecom via a subsidiary.
The list above only includes those companies whose results or financial position, in the opinion of the Directors, principally affects the figures shown in the financial statements.
On 18 June 2004 Cable & Wireless acquired 55% of Monaco Telecom, a Monaco based telecommunication service provider, from Vivendi Universal.
Simultaneously with the acquisition, Cable & Wireless transferred legal ownership of 6% of the shares of Monaco Telecom to an unrelated third party.
Cable & Wireless contractually retained voting and economic rights in the shares as part of the arrangement.
In addition, the 6% interest is subject to certain put and call options that, together with the retained voting and economic rights, provide full management control of Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless.
Cable & Wireless has also entered into a shareholders agreement with the Principality of Monaco, which contains, among other provisions, a prohibition on either Cable & Wireless or the Principality subject to certain limited exceptions selling their shares in Monaco Telecom for five years, mutual pre-emption rights on transfer of shares and certain other limited rights in favour of the Principality.
The Principality has a put option entitling it to put its 45% shareholding in Monaco Telecom to Cable & Wireless at certain times after 1 January 2008.
The exercise price under the put option is fair market value, taking into account the nature of the minority stake in Monaco Telecom.

The impact of the adoption of the new standard on the net assets as at 31 March 2005 is presented below.

ii The terms and conditions of the Companys Convertible debt instrument result in a recognition and measurement basis that is different from the basis applied prior to the adoption of FRS 25 and FRS 26.
The debt agreement provides for the conversion of the debt into Ordinary Shares of Cable and Wireless plc at a predetermined fixed rate.
The conversion is at the option of the bondholders and exercisable at any time prior to 9 July 2010.
The bond also has a takeover protection clause, which adjusts the share conversion factor, over a period of time, until settlement or conversion of the bond.
The Company has the option to settle the entire bond in cash although this option was removed in April 2005.
The takeover protection terms and the cash settlement option are considered to be derivative features that are required to be accounted for separately from the debt element of the bond.
The liability component and the derivative features are separated and measured in accordance with the requirements of FRS 25 and FRS 26.
At 1 April 2005, the debt element was reduced by 60 million primarily reflecting the unamortised value of the conversion option.
The debt element is accounted for on an amortised cost basis.
The conversion option and takeover protection feature were marked to market at 1 April 2005 and recognised on balance sheet giving rise to a derivative liability of 47 million.
The derivative elements are carried on a fair value basis with changes in value being taken to the profit and loss account.
Subsequent to 1 April 2005 the cash settlement option in respect of the conversion option was removed and the conversion option reclassified as a component of equity.

Under FRS 25 and FRS 26 the Loan has been translated at the closing rate at 1 April 2005, giving rise to a reduction in the balance of 15 million.
No deferred tax impact has been booked as a consequence of the above adjustments as there are unrecognised tax losses available to offset any additional liability.

Other matters In addition the Company has, as is considered standard practice in such agreements, given guarantees and indemnities in relation to a number of disposals of subsidiary undertakings in prior years.
