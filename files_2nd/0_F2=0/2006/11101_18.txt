First Time Adoption of IFRS The year ending 28 January 2006 is the first year that the Group has presented its consolidated financial statements under International Financial Reporting Standards IFRS.
The last financial statements under UK GAAP were for the year ended 29 January 2005: the Groups date of transition to IFRS was therefore 1 February 2004.
The disclosures required in the year of transition are given below.
The adoption of IFRS represents an accounting change only and does not affect the operations or cash flows of the Group.
At transition, the only impact on the Company relates to the recognition of dividends under IAS 10.

In accordance with IAS 17, lease incentives are now recognised in the income statement over the full term of the lease.
Share based payment IFRS 2 Under IFRS 2, the charge recognised in the income statement for share options, long term incentive plans and other share based payments are based on the fair value of the awards, calculated using an option pricing model.
This contrasts to UK GAAP, where the charge recognised was based on the intrinsic value of awards, being the difference between the market value of the shares at the date of the award and the option exercise price.
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 2, the Group has applied the fair value model to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested as at 1 February 2004.
Employee benefits IAS 19 Retirement obligations Under UK GAAP, the cost to the Group of the defined benefit section of the Group pension scheme was charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the costs of pensions over employees working lives with the Group.
The pension provision in the balance sheet represented the differences between contributions paid and cumulative amounts charged to profit: the assets and liabilities of the scheme itself were not recognised on the Groups balance sheet.
IAS 19 requires the operating and financing costs of defined benefit pensions to be recognised separately in the income statement, but permits a number of alternative accounting treatments for actuarial gains and losses.
The Group has elected to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in full in the period in which they occur, directly in equity via the statement of recognised income and expense.
This option has been selected for consistency, as it is most similar to the treatment required under UK GAAP FRS 17 that has previously been disclosed by way of a note in the Groups financial statements.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet under IAS 19 represents the present value of the defined benefit liabilities under the projected unit credit method, as reduced by the market value of scheme assets.
Short term benefits IAS 19 requires holiday pay to be accrued for when the corresponding services have been received from employees.
This results in the recognition of a provision of 2.7m on transition to IFRS.
Other adjustments These adjustments are included within the Other column in the reconciliations above, with major line item components referenced to the notes below.
a Goodwill and business combinations IFRS 3 The Group has elected to take the exemption available under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to business combinations occurring prior to the date of transition to IFRS.
Goodwill arising on such acquisitions has therefore been retained at its UK GAAP carrying value at 1 February 2004, having been satisfactorily tested for impairment at that date.
Under UK GAAP goodwill was amortised over its useful economic life, but under IFRS no amortisation charge is made.
This increases reported profit for the year ended 29 January 2005 by 4.3m.
Instead, goodwill recognised in the balance sheet is subject to a review for impairment on at least an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.
Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated as an asset and will not be included in determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
66 First Time Adoption of IFRS b Dividends IAS 10 Dividends are now recognised only when they are declared and approved, rather than accrued for in the period to which they relate.
Compared to the treatment under UK GAAP this has the effect of deferring the recognition of dividends to the following half year.
In addition, dividends are shown as a movement directly in equity instead of through the income statement.
c Property, plant & equipment IAS 16 IAS 16 requires residual values to be based on prices current at the balance sheet date, whereas under UK GAAP residual values were based on prices prevailing at the date of acquisition.
In the case of the Groups freehold and long leasehold property, the majority of which are recorded at historical cost, residual values assessed under IFRS are greater than the corresponding book values.
Consequently, the depreciation charged on these properties after transition to IFRS will be zero, subject to an annual review of residual values.
This increases reported profit for the year ended January 2005 by 1.9m.
d Deferred taxation IAS 12 IAS 12 takes a balance sheet approach to deferred tax whereby deferred tax is recognised in the balance sheet by applying the appropriate tax rate to the temporary differences arising between the carrying value of assets and liabilities and their tax base.
This contrasts to UK GAAP FRS 19, which considers timing differences arising in the income statement.
Adjustments made to the financial statements on the transition to IFRS result in related adjustments to deferred tax, particularly with regard to lease incentives, share based payments and post-retirement benefits.
Due to the excess of capital losses brought forward within the Group, changes to capital deferred tax assets do not affect reported deferred tax balances.
Net deferred tax assets have also been reclassified from deferred tax liabilities.
e Borrowing costs IAS 23 Under UK GAAP, the Group had a small amount of capitalised interest 0.8m included within property stocks.
No other capitalised interest was included in the book values of any other current or fixed assets.
Under IFRS, the Group is required to apply its policy of non-capitalisation consistently across all classes of asset.
Accordingly, the capitalised interest is written off on transition to IFRS resulting in a correspondingly increased profit on the subsequent disposal of property.
f Cumulative translation differences Under IFRS, exchange differences arising on consolidation on the translation of overseas subsidiaries are required to be recognised as a separate equity reserve.
On disposal of an overseas subsidiary, the cumulative exchange gain or loss associated with that subsidiary is recognised in the income statement as part of the profit or loss on disposal.
The Group has utilised the exemption available in IFRS 1 whereby cumulative translation differences are deemed to be zero at the date of transition to IFRS: the profit or loss on all subsequent disposals therefore excludes any translation differences arising prior to 1 February 2004. g Reclassifications Carrying values of previously re-valued assets have been treated as deemed cost on transition to IFRS, in accordance with the provisions of IFRS 1.
Accordingly, the Groups revaluation reserve has been reclassified to other reserves.
67 First Time Adoption of IFRS Financial instruments In accordance with IFRS 1 First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group has elected not to restate comparative information for the impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 Financial Instruments.
The opening balance sheet at 30 January 2005 has been adjusted to reflect the adoption of these standards from that date and details of these adjustments are set out below.
