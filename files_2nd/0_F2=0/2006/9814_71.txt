Property leases When valuations of leasehold properties based on future estimated income streams give rise to a deficit as a result of onerous lease conditions they are recognised as liabilities in provisions.
Payments are expected to continue on these properties for periods of 17 to 42 years.
The amounts are not discounted as the Directors consider the discounted amounts would not be materially different from the amounts recognised.
