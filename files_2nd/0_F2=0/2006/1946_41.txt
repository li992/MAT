Bellway p. l. c. Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Accounts continued 23 Employee benefits Retirement benefit obligations The Group sponsors the Bellway p. l. c. 1972 Pension and Life Assurance Scheme which is a funded defined benefit arrangement.
The last full actuarial valuation of this Scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 1 August 2005 and was updated on an approximate basis to 31 July 2006.
The regular contributions made by the employer over the financial year have been 1,102,000, equivalent to approximately 24.6% of pensionable pay.
This includes premiums in respect of death in service benefits.
This level of contribution increased to 32.7% of pensionable pay with effect from 1 August 2006 and is to continue until reviewed following the triennial valuation of the Scheme due as at 1 August 2008.
In addition, the employer paid a special contribution of 3,274,000 in July 2006.
Expenses were paid in addition.
It is the policy of the Company to recognise all actuarial gains and losses in the year in which they occur outside the income statement and in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Insured pensions and defined contributions have been excluded from the assets and liabilities.

Best estimate of contributions to be paid to the Scheme for the year ended 31 July 2007 This best estimate of contributions to be paid to the Scheme for the year ending 31 July 2007 is 1,560,000 in respect of regular contributions and 5,000,000 in respect of special contributions.

The expected return on bonds is determined by reference to UK long-dated gilt and bond yields at the balance sheet date.
The expected rate of return on equities has been determined by setting an appropriate risk premium above gilt bond yields having regard to market conditions at the balance sheet date.
The expected long-term rates of return are as follows: 2006 2005 2004 % per annum % per annum % per annum Equities 6.50 6.50 6.50 Bonds 5.00 5.00 5.00 Cash 4.00 4.00 4.00 Overall for scheme 5.90 5.90 5.90 Actual return of Scheme assets The actual return on the Scheme assets over the year ending 31 July 2006 was 9.9%.

Annual Report & Accounts 2006 Notes to the Accounts continued 23 Employee benefits continued Share-based payments The Group operates a long-term incentive plan LTIP, an annual bonus scheme, employee share option schemes ESOS and savings related share option schemes SRSOS all of which are detailed below.
IFRS 2 has been applied to options granted after 7 November 2002, which had not vested at 1 January 2005.
Awards under the LTIP and the annual bonus scheme have been made to executive directors and the company secretary.
Share options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1995 Employee Share Option Scheme 1995 Scheme have been granted to employees at all levels as well as to executive directors.
The last tranche of shares was awarded to directors in October 2003.
No further options may be granted under this scheme.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. 1996 Employee Share Option Scheme 1996 Scheme have been granted to executive directors and certain other employees.
Options issued under the Bellway p. l. c. Savings Related Share Option Scheme SRSOS are offered to all employees including the executive directors.
Vesting of options under the LTIP is dependent upon total shareholder return of the Group measured against relevant comparator companies, as detailed on page 40 within the Report of the Board on Directors Remuneration.
One half of the annual bonus is payable in November each year following the announcement of the Groups annual results.
The other half is used to acquire Bellway shares at the prevailing market value.
These shares are held in the Bellway p. l. c. Employee Share Trust 1992 for three years.
The shares can then be transferred into the employees name.
In addition, various small share awards were made in 2003 to employees mainly at divisional management level with a three year vesting period.
Share options have been valued by an external third party using various models detailed below, based on publicly available market data at the time of the grant, which the directors consider to be the most appropriate method of determining their fair value.

Valuation methodology For the LTIP, a Monte Carlo simulation method is used which allows the Groups performance, in terms of total shareholder return, to be measured against its comparator companies.
Individual share price volatilities are calculated for each of the comparator companies.
A correlation assumption, appropriate to the building sector, is also used.
In the case of the deferred element of the annual bonus, a simplified Black Scholes method is applied with an exercise price and dividend yield of zero.
This is because no performance conditions attach to the award.
The result is that the fair value equates to the face value of the award.
For the 1995, 1996 and 2005 Schemes, a lattice method is used which enables early exercise behaviour to be modelled in a more sophisticated manner than under Black Scholes.
The Black Scholes method is used for the SRSOS due to the relatively short exercise window of six months.
