Retirement benefits The group operates a number of pension plans throughout the world, devised in accordance with local conditions and practices.
The larger plans are generally of the defined benefit type and are funded by payments to separately administered funds or insurance companies.
The principal plans are in the United Kingdom, Ireland, United States and Canada.
All valuations were performed by independent actuaries using the projected unit method to determine pension costs.
The most recent full valuations of the significant defined benefit pension plans were carried out as follows: United Kingdom on 31 March 2003: United States on 1 January 2006: and Ireland on 31 December 2003.
The measurement dates used to calculate the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are the respective balance sheet dates.
A full valuation of the Diageo pension scheme in the United Kingdom is being carried out as at 31 March 2006, but this will not be finalised and approved by the trustees until November 2006 and the updated membership data has not been reflected in the disclosures which follow.
The group also operates a number of plans, primarily in the United States, which provide employees with post employment benefits in respect of medical costs.
These plans are generally unfunded.
In addition, there are a number of other schemes which provide post employment benefits other than pensions and medical benefits.
These schemes are also included in the figures presented below.
82 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... a The following weighted average assumptions were used to determine the groups deficit surplus in the post employment plans at 30 June in the relevant year.
The assumptions used to calculate the profit and loss charge credit for the year to 30 June are based on the assumptions disclosed as at the previous 30 June.

The 2006 assumption for medical inflation in the United States reduces by 1% per year to 5% 2005 1% per year to 5%.
In assessing the groups post retirement liabilities, the mortality assumption for the largest plan which is in the United Kingdom is based on the mortality experience of that plan.
This mortality experience analysis was carried out in 2006 as part of the triennial funding valuation of that plan.
The assumption is based on up to date mortality tables and allows for future improvements in life expectancy.
The mortality assumptions for the other plans around the world are based on relevant standard mortality tables in each country.
For the UK and Irish pension funds, the table below illustrates the expected age at death of an average worker who retires currently at the age of 65, and one who is currently aged 45 and subsequently retires at the age of 65: United Kingdom Ireland 2006 2005 2006 2005 Age Age Age Age Retiring currently at age 65 Male 84.3 83.5 84.0 84.0 Female 87.1 86.4 86.9 86.9 Currently aged 45, retiring at age 65 Male 86.7 85.2 84.8 84.8 Female 89.4 88.1 87.8 87.8 Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 83 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued.......................................................................... 4 Employees continued b The amounts charged in respect of post employment plans to the consolidated income statement and consolidated statement of recognised income and expense for the two years ended 30 June 2006 are set out below: United United States and Kingdom Ireland other Total million million million million 2006 Operating profit Current service cost 58 22 24 104 Past service cost 1 1 2 Gains on curtailments 1 1 Total charge to operating profit 58 23 24 105 Net credit cost to other finance income note 6 ii 14 11 6 19 Charge before taxation 44 12 30 86 Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on post employment plan assets 513 84 15 612 Expected return on post employment plan assets 191 60 24 275 Actual return less expected return on post employment plan assets 322 24 9 337 Experience gains and losses arising on the plan liabilities 29 14 12 55 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities 2 149 36 183 Actuarial gain recognisable in the reconciliation of the surplus 291 159 15 465 Changes in the recognisable surplus of the plans with a surplus restriction 6 6 Actuarial gain recognisable in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense291 159 9 459 2005 Operating profit Current service cost 58 15 20 93 Past service cost 2 10 12 Gains on curtailments 18 1 19 Losses on settlements 2 2 Total charge to operating profit 42 25 21 88 Net credit cost to other finance income note 6 ii 4 9 4 9 Charge before taxation 38 16 25 79 Consolidated statement of recognised income and expense Actual return on post employment plan assets 318 129 30 477 Expected return on post employment plan assets 194 62 24 280 Actual return less expected return on post employment plan assets 124 67 6 197 Experience gains and losses arising on the plan liabilities 3 15 12 24 Changes in assumptions underlying the present value of the plan liabilities 171 198 50 419 Actuarial loss recognisable in the reconciliation of the surplus 44 146 56 246 Changes in the recognisable surplus of the plans with a surplus restriction 8 8 Actuarial loss recognisable in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense 44 146 48 238 Total cumulative gain loss recognised in the consolidated statement of recognised income and expense At 1 July 2004 Recognised in the year 44 146 48 238 At 30 June 2005 44 146 48 238 Recognised in the year 291 159 9 459 At 30 June 2006 247 13 39 221 84 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... c The expected long term rates of return and fair values of the assets of the significant defined benefit post employment plans were as follows: United Kingdom Ireland United States and other Total Expected Expected Expected Expected long term long term long term long term rates of Fair rates of Fair rates of Fair rates of Fair return value return value return value return value % million % million % million % million 2006 Fair value of plan assets Equities 7.8 2,504 7.6 759 8.5 213 7.8 3,476 Bonds 4.9 224 4.4 146 5.6 125 4.9 495 Property 6.8 389 6.6 138 11.6 10 6.8 537 Other 4.1 93 2.8 16 5.8 30 4.3 139 3,210 1,059 378 4,647 Present value of funded plan liabilities 3,688 1,149 363 5,200 Present value of unfunded plan liabilities 73 151 224 Deficit in post employment plans 551 90 136 777 Surplus restriction 24 24 Post employment benefit liabilities 551 90 160 801 2005 Fair value of plan assets Equities 7.5 2,254 6.9 712 8.0 215 7.4 3,181 Bonds 4.7 128 3.4 159 5.1 112 4.3 399 Property 6.5 322 5.9 120 12.1 10 6.5 452 Other 3.8 82 2.0 9 3.5 13 3.6 104 2,786 1,000 350 4,136 Present value of funded plan liabilities 3,562 1,238 373 5,173 Present value of unfunded plan liabilities 76 163 239 Deficit in post employment plans 852 238 186 1,276 Surplus restriction 18 18 Post employment benefit liabilities 852 238 204 1,294 Included in the post employment plan deficit of 777 million 2005 1,276 million is 101 million 2005 95 million in respect of post employment medical benefit liabilities and 41 million 2005 43 million in respect of other non pension post employment liabilities.

Post employment benefit assets and liabilities are recognised in the consolidated balance sheet as follows: 2006 2005 million million Non-current assets 14 12 Non-current liabilities 815 1,306 801 1,294 Diageo Annual Report 2006 | 85 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued.......................................................................... 4 Employees continued The expected long term rates of return for equities have been determined by reference to government bond rates minimum risk rates in the countries in which the plans are based.
As at 30 June 2006, to reflect the additional risks associated with equities, expected long term rates of return on equities include a risk premium of 3.25% per year 2005 3.25% per year in excess of the expected return from government bonds.
This risk premium is a long term assumption which is set after taking actuarial advice and considering the assumptions used by other FTSE 100 companies.
The expected long term rates of return for other assets are determined in a similar way, by using an appropriate risk premium relative to government bonds in the relevant country.
The groups investment strategy for its funded post employment plans is decided locally by the trustees of the plan and or Diageo, as appropriate, and takes account of the relevant statutory requirements.
The groups objective for the investment strategy is to achieve a target rate of return in excess of the return on the liabilities, while taking an acceptable amount of investment risk relative to the liabilities.
This objective is implemented by using specific allocations to a variety of asset classes that are expected over the long term to deliver the target rate of return.
Most investment strategies have significant allocations to equities, with the intention that this will result in the ongoing cost to the group of the post employment plans being lower over the long term, and will be within acceptable boundaries of risk.
Each investment strategy is also designed to control investment risk by managing allocations to asset classes, geographical exposures and individual stock exposures.
For the Diageo pension scheme in the United Kingdom UK pension scheme, as at 30 June 2006 the target investment allocations were approximately 85% of the assets in equities, 5% in bonds and 10% in property.
In addition the UK pension scheme uses interest rate and inflation swaps to help manage the mismatch between the pension schemes assets and the present value of its liabilities.
At 30 June 2006, approximately 40% of the UK pension schemes liabilities were hedged against future movements in interest rates and inflation and the fair value of these swaps was 3 million.
For the principal Irish pension scheme, as at 30 June 2006 the target investment allocations were approximately 70% of the assets in equities, 20% in bonds and 10% in property.
The trustees of the UK pension scheme and principal Irish pension scheme have recently reviewed their investment strategy and approved a phased approach to further increasing asset diversification and, subject to solvency triggers, a phased approach to progressively reducing risk by increasing the bond allocation.
The discount rate is based on the yields of high quality, long dated, fixed income investments of similar duration to the liabilities.
For the UK pension scheme, which represents approximately 70% of total post employment benefit liabilities, the discount rate is based on the i-Boxx over 15-year non-gilt AA sterling corporate bond index at 30 June rounded to the nearest 0.1%.
A similar process is used to determine the discount rate for the non-UK plans.
The percentages of investments at fair value held by the pension plans at 30 June 2006 and 30 June 2005, analysed by category, were as follows: United United States and Kingdom Ireland other Total %%%% 2006 Equities 78 72 56 75 Bonds 7 14 33 10 Property 12 13 3 12 Other 3 1 8 3 100 100 100 100 2005 Equities 81 71 61 77 Bonds 5 16 32 10 Property 12 12 3 11 Other 2 1 4 2 100 100 100 100 86 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... d Movements in the present value of plan liabilities during the two years ended 30 June 2006: United United States and Kingdom Ireland other Total million million million million Present value of plan liabilities at 1 July 2004 3,374 994 444 4,812 Exchange differences 4 15 19 Acquisition of businesses 3 3 Current service cost 58 15 20 93 Past service cost 2 10 12 Interest cost 190 53 28 271 Actuarial loss 168 213 62 443 Employee contributions 8 2 1 11 Benefits paid 144 53 38 235 Curtailments 18 1 19 Settlements 2 2 Present value of plan liabilities at 30 June 2005 3,638 1,238 536 5,412 Exchange differences 25 8 17 Acquisition of businesses 8 1 9 Current service cost 58 22 24 104 Past service cost 1 1 2 Interest cost 177 49 30 256 Actuarial loss gain 31 135 24 128 Employee contributions 8 2 1 11 Benefits paid 153 53 38 244 Curtailments 1 1 Settlements 6 8 14 Present value of plan liabilities at 30 June 2006 3,761 1,149 514 5,424 For the year ended 30 June 2006, benefits paid include 3 million in respect of post employment medical benefits in the United States and there were no subsidy receipts in respect of prescription drugs.

For these purposes, the value of the deficit, calculated using the trustees actuarial valuation of the scheme, will be ascertained through the triennial valuation as at 31 March 2006.
Following the completion of that valuation, the annual cash contribution that Diageo will make under this funding plan is estimated to be 50 million in each of the four years of the plan.
Payments will be made into an escrow account under the joint control of the group and the trustees, with release from escrow to either the group or the trustees determined by an agreed formula in the light of the actuarial valuation of the scheme as at 31 March 2009.
Investment returns on the funds held in escrow will accrue to the group.
In addition to the deficit funding, Diageo will continue to make a cash contribution in respect of current service cost based on the trustees valuation: this contribution is expected to be 52 million in the year ending 30 June 2007.
Funding arrangements will be reviewed and adjusted in the light of future triennial actuarial valuations.
Contributions to other plans in the year ending 30 June 2007 are expected to be approximately 37 million.
f The future benefits expected to be paid by the post employment plans, up to 30 June 2016, are as follows: Payments due in the year ending 30 June 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012-2016 million million million million million million United Kingdom pension benefits 160 164 169 173 178 961 other 222228 Ireland pension benefits 55 55 56 56 57 298 United States and Canada pension benefits 35 19 20 21 20 110 other 55566 29 Other countries pension benefits 55555 25 other 66666 32 268 256 263 269 274 1,463 88 | Diageo Annual Report 2006.......................................................................... g Changes in the assumptions used for determining post employment costs and liabilities may have a material impact on the income statement and balance sheet.
