Segment reporting continued The Groups primary format for segment reporting is business segments based on the Groups management and internal reporting structure.
The secondary format is geographical segments showing the geographical origin of the Groups activity and net assets.
Further details on these business segments are given in the Business Review on pages 9 to 21.
The Group operates in two principal geographical areas: the UK and western continental Europe.
Two further segments are identied: eastern continental Europe and the rest of the world.
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year.
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level.
Capital employed excludes items of a nancing nature, taxation balances, pension liabilities and xed asset investments: segmental capital employed comprises identiable segment assets less segmental liabilities.
Average capital employed is the average monthly capital employed.
The adjusted return on average capital employed is dened as operating profit before exceptional items divided by average capital employed.

Intangible assets continued Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill The following units have significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 2006 2005 m m UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging 140.3 140.4 Plastic Packaging 31.7 31.1 172.0 171.5 Multiple units with no individually significant goodwill 5.8 3.3 177.8 174.8 As set out in accounting policy h in note 1, the Group tests its goodwill for potential impairment annually.
The recoverable amount of the Groups cash generating units is calculated on the present value of expected future cash ows the value-in-use or the net selling price fair value, if greater.
Given the limited available information on the likely fair value of the Groups assets, the recoverable amount is predominately the value-in-use.
The value-in-use calculations use a pre-tax discount rate of 9.2%, derived from the Groups weighted average cost of capital, and cover a five-year period with a terminal value.
The cash ows included in the value-in-use are based for the forthcoming and subsequent financial year on the Group Plan approved by the Board of Directors: subsequent years cash ows are based on estimates of future performance.
The key assumptions used in the calculation are as follows: long-term sales growth up to 3%: capital expenditure equal to annual depreciation: and nominal growth in profit at terminal value up to 2.5%.

The effect of the adoption of IAS 39 on net debt was an increase as at 1 May 2005 of 2.1m on previous total net debt of 260.7m to result in net debt of 262.8m.
This compares with the previous UK GAAP measure of 260.4m.
The adoption of IAS 39 resulted in an increase in gearing of 0.5 percentage points to 50.7%: this compares with the previous UK GAAP measure of 53.1%, the decrease being largely the result of the higher level of net assets under adopted IFRSs.

Interest rates on oating rate borrowings are based on LIBOR, EURIBOR or base rates.
In April 2005, the Group entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility of 250m, which expires on 31 May 2010.
Advances drawn down under this facility bear interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR.
In November 2002, the Group entered into a note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of 6.24% senior notes and 25m of 6.85% senior notes, which will mature on 14 November 2012.
The Group entered into a swap transaction with a bank counterparty under which it made a payment of US$80m in return for 81.6m.
The swap counterparty also agreed to pay xed rate dollar interest of 6.24% per annum in exchange for oating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR.
In addition, swap counterparties also agreed to pay xed rate dollar interest of 6.24% per annum on a principal amount of $25m in exchange for oating dollar interest linked to dollar LIBOR and xed rate sterling interest of 6.85% per annum on a principal of 25m in exchange for oating sterling interest linked to sterling LIBOR.
In August 2004, the Group entered into a further note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of 5.66% senior notes and US$95m of 5.80% senior notes, which will mature on 25 August 2014 and 25 August 2016, respectively.
The Group entered into swap transactions with a bank counterparty under which it made payments of US$105m and US$20m in return for 86.5m and 16.5m, respectively, and a payment of $75m in return for 40.8m.
The swap counterparty agreed to pay xed rate dollar interest of 5.66% per annum and 5.80% per annum, respectively: in exchange for oating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR and xed rate dollar interest of 5.80% per annum in exchange for xed rate sterling interest at rates of 6.21% per annum.

Financial instruments In accordance with IFRS 1, the Group has taken the exemption from the requirement to restate comparative information for IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Accordingly the financial instruments disclosure presented in this note on the basis of IAS 32 and IAS 39 is only for 2006.
The UK GAAP FRS 13 disclosures for 2005 are shown separately below.
a IFRS disclosures The summary of the Groups key financial risks and the policies and objectives in place to manage these risks is set out in the Financial Review and Risk Management sections of the Business Review on pages 22 to 28.
The derivative financial instruments set out in this note have been entered into to achieve the Groups risk management objectives.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest-rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest-rate, currency and commodity risks associated with the Groups underlying business activities and the nancing of these activities.
The assets and liabilities as at 30 April 2006 in respect of derivative financial instruments are as follows: Assets Liabilities Net m m m Derivatives held to: Manage the Groups exposure to foreign exchange on foreign currency investments 9.7 9.7 Manage the interest-rate and currency exposure of borrowings 0.8 15.2 14.4 Derivative financial instruments included in net debt 0.8 24.9 24.1 Hedge future transactions energy costs 4.3 1.9 2.4 Hedge future transactions foreign exchange on purchases and sales of goods and services 0.2 0.2 5.1 27.0 21.9 Current 3.7 2.0 1.7 Non-current 1.4 25.0 23.6 5.1 27.0 21.9 i Foreign exchange risk on investments The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currency of which differs from the Groups presentational currency.
The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps.
ii Interest-rate and currency risk on borrowings The Groups policy on interest-rate risk is designed to limit the Groups exposure to uctuating interest rates.
The Group designates interest rate swaps as fair value hedges, to swap xed-rate debt into oating rates, and as cash ow hedges, to swap oating-rate debt into xed rates.
The Group is exposed to currency risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies.
The Group hedges this exposure through cross-currency swaps designated as either cash ow or fair value hedges.
iii Commodity price risk The Group is exposed to price risk on energy purchases.
Such commodity price risk is managed by a combination of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments.
iv Foreign exchange risk on transactions The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk where a business unit makes sales and purchases in a currency other than its functional currency.
To reduce this exposure the Group uses foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash ow hedges.
v Credit risk The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk and does not enter into financial instruments to manage credit risk.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2006 73 20.
Financial instruments continued a IFRS disclosures continued vi Fair values of financial assets and liabilities The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arms length basis.
For financial instruments carried at fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists.
The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses swap models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value cross-currency and interest-rate swaps.
All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39 hedge accounting rules, only the portions of the note purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the balance sheet.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities which bear a oating rate of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value.
For current and non-current receivables note 15 and current and non-current payables note 16 and provisions note 22 fair value is estimated to be equivalent to book value and is not included in the table below.

Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of these items because it is not probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the Group can utilise the benets therefrom.
Deferred tax liabilities have not been provided for in respect of unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as there is no current intention for any of the relevant overseas entities to remit their earnings.

In respect of the Companys shares that are held by the Group see below, all rights are suspended until those shares are reissued.
A reconciliation of the movement in share capital is given in note 9 to the Company balance sheet on page 97.
Translation reserve The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Companys net investment in a foreign subsidiary.
As explained in note 1 a iv, the translation reserve was set to nil on transition to adopted IFRSs at 1 May 2004 and therefore the opening balance contains differences only from that date.
Hedging reserve The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash ow hedging instruments related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
Own shares The reserve for the Companys own shares comprises the cost of the Companys shares held by the Group.
The Group operates a General Employee benefit Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Executive Share Option scheme, the Restricted Share Plan discontinued in 2004 and the Long-Term Incentive Plan established in 2004.
At 30 April 2006, the Trust held 2.6m shares 2005: 3.0m shares.
The market value of the shares at 30 April 2006 was 3.9m 2005: 4.5m.
Dividends receivable on the shares owned by the Trust have been waived.
Post-retirement benets Liability for dened benefit obligations The Group operates two funded dened benefit schemes in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension Scheme the Group scheme and the DS Smith Containers Pension Scheme the Containers scheme.
The Containers scheme was established in 2004 following the acquisition of Linpac Containers and assumed the pension obligations and related pension scheme assets of relevant employees of Linpac Containers through a bulk transfer.
The Group contributed 14.0m to the Group scheme in 2005 06 and contributions will remain at this level in 2006 07.
The Group contributed 0.6m to the Containers scheme and expects to make broadly similar contributions in the future.
The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives: these are, in aggregate, not significant to the Group.
The financial information given below includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where appropriate.
A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements.
The most recent actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was at 5 April 2004, which has been updated to 30 April 2006 by a qualied independent actuary.
The Containers scheme was valued for the purpose of the bulk transfer described above and this valuation has been updated to 30 April 2006 by a qualied independent actuary.
All valuations used the projected unit method.
Both the Group scheme and the Containers scheme are closed to new entrants.
Because of this, the average age of the active members is likely to increase at future valuations and this will lead to an increasing current service contribution rate: this may be offset by a falling total pensionable salary resulting from leavers and retirements.

Using these tables, a male member currently aged 40 is expected to live for a further 43.2 years, while a male pensioner aged 65 is expected to live for a further 16.9 years.
The tables above have been used as at 30 April 2006 and 30 April 2005 and reect published mortality investigation data in conjunction with the consideration of the mortality experience of scheme members.

Share-based payment expense The Groups share-based payment arrangements are as follows: a An Executive Share Option Scheme ESOS is operated for Executive Directors and other senior executives.
Approved and unapproved options are granted to UK and overseas executives on a phased basis.
The exercise of any options granted under this Scheme is subject to the achievement of long-term performance conditions.
The target for future options granted will be that the growth in the Companys normalised earnings per share must match or exceed the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three-year period following grant.
The base financial year for the purposes of measuring earnings per share growth will be the financial year prior to the grant date.
Normally, no part of the option may be exercised unless the performance target has been achieved and the vesting period of three years service has been attained.
b In the past Executive Directors and other senior executives received an award of shares in the Company equal in value to the participants annual cash bonus, pursuant to a Restricted Share Plan RSP.
The award of these shares is dependent upon performance in the relevant financial year.
There is a vesting period of three years service.
This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2004. c In September 2004, the Group established a Long-Term Incentive Plan LTIP.
The key features of the plan are that: Awards will be made to selected Executive Directors and other senior executives over shares in the Company: performance will be measured over a single period of three financial years: Awards will vest based on the Companys total shareholder return being the increase in share price and the value of reinvested dividends compared to a comparator group of companies, being the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index excluding investment trusts for initial awards: If the Companys total shareholder return is ranked in the upper quartile of the comparator group or higher, the full award will vest, reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance.
None of the award vests for below median performance: and Additionally, no awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Companys earnings per share growth matches or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three year period.
During the year, awards totalling 1,593,516 shares were made to participating executives under the LTIP.
At 30 April 2006, the total number of shares awarded and outstanding under the LTIP was 2,929,312 2005: 1,556,332. d The Company operates a Savings Related Option Scheme, which is an all-employee share scheme approved by the Inland Revenue.
The last grant under this Scheme matured in June 2005.

Explanation of the transition to IFRS These are the Groups first consolidated IFRS financial statements for a full financial year.
The accounting policies set out in note 1 have been applied in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2006, the comparative information presented in these financial statements for the year ended 30 April 2005 and in the preparation of an opening IFRS balance sheet at 1 May 2004 the Groups date of transition.
In preparing its opening IFRS balance sheet, the Group adjusted amounts reported previously in financial statements prepared in accordance with its previous basis of accounting UK GAAP.
An explanation of how the transition from UK GAAP to adopted IFRSs affected the Groups financial position, financial performance and cash ows is set out in the following tables and the notes that accompany the tables.
Explanation of the transition to IFRS continued Effect of the transition to IFRS on the consolidated income statement Year ended 30 April 2005 Effect of UK transition GAAP to IFRS IFRS Note m m m Revenue 1,624.9 1,624.9 Cost of sales e 1,195.4 0.2 1,195.2 Gross profit 429.5 0.2 429.7 Distribution expenses 183.1 183.1 Administrative expenses a, b, d 183.0 8.3 174.7 Operating profit 63.4 8.5 71.9 Net nancing costs g 11.9 0.2 12.1 Share of profit of associates a, g 5.6 1.1 4.5 profit before tax 57.1 7.2 64.3 Income tax expense c, d, e, g 17.6 1.4 16.2 profit for the period 39.5 8.6 48.1 Attributable to: DS Smith Plc shareholders 38.9 47.1 Minority interest 0.6 1.0 Basic earnings per share pence 10.1p 12.2p Diluted earnings per share pence 10.0p 12.1p Effect of the transition to IFRS on the consolidated statement of cash ows Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Groups cash management were classied as nancing cash ows under UK GAAP and are reclassied as cash and cash equivalents under adopted IFRSs.
There are no other material differences between the cash ow statement presented under adopted IFRSs and the cash ow statement presented under UK GAAP.
90 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2006 Notes to the Financial Statements continued 36.
Explanation of the transition to IFRS continued Notes to the statements of the effect of the transition to IFRS a Goodwill amortisation IFRS 3, Business Combinations, requires that goodwill be capitalised at cost and tested for impairment at least annually, with any impairment losses being recognised immediately in the income statement.
Goodwill amortised during the year ended 30 April 2005 under UK GAAP was 8.8m, which was written back under adopted IFRSs.
b Negative goodwill In accordance with IFRS 3, negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Accordingly, 0.2m of negative goodwill arising on the acquisition of BPB Recycling, within the UK Paper and Corrugated Packaging segment, in August 2004 was credited to the 2004 05 income statement.
As at 30 April 2005, under UK GAAP the Group had a carrying amount of 8.5m of negative goodwill which was credited to retained earnings under adopted IFRSs.
On 1 May 2004, the Group had a carrying amount of 8.8m of negative goodwill which had been credited to retained earnings.
The effect of the 2005 and 2004 adjustments was to increase intangible assets and investments in associates.
c Deferred tax Under adopted IFRSs, specically IAS 12, Income Taxes, deferred taxation is provided in full on all taxable temporary differences between the book carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
IAS 12 is generally more comprehensive in the requirement to recognise deferred tax than UK GAAP.
The Group has acquired land and buildings in past business combinations that have a depreciable tax base cost that is lower than their book amount.
A temporary difference arises in this case under adopted IFRSs and a deferred tax liability is established in purchase accounting, whereas under UK GAAP this was not the case.
The Group chose not to restate business combinations prior to the IFRS transition date 1 May 2004.
As a result of this, under the transitional requirements of IFRS 1, the deferred taxation liability on the land and buildings assets above was required to be recognised and adjusted through retained earnings rather than as an adjustment to capitalised goodwill.
The effect was to reduce equity at 30 April 2005 by 7.1m and 7.4m at 1 May 2004.
Any deferred tax raised will reverse through the consolidated income statement as the underlying book-to-tax temporary difference is amortised.
The net impact from the recognition of additional temporary differences on acquisitions was to increase profit after tax by 0.3m for the year ended 30 April 2005. d Share-Based payments The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.
IFRS 2, Share-Based Payment, requires that an expense for share options granted be recognised in the financial statements based on their fair value at the date of grant.
This expense is recognised over the vesting period of the options.
The Group measures this expense for options granted after 7 November 2002 and not yet vested at 1 May 2004, in accordance with the exemption permitted under IFRS 1.
The charge to the income statement for the year ended 30 April 2005 was 1.1m.
As these compensation plans are settled in equity, there was a nil effect on the balance sheet, other than 0.4m 1 May 2004: 0.1m deferred tax asset relating to these charges as at 30 April 2005. e Holiday pay and long-service awards Under IAS 19, Employee Benets, an accrual is recognised to take into account all short-term employee benets including paid absences for holiday and sickness.
Previously the Group did not accrue for long-service awards which were expensed only when incurred.
As at 30 April 2005, an additional 2.5m 1 May 2004: 2.7m was accrued for holiday pay and 0.3m 1 May 2004: 0.3m for longservice awards.
The related deferred tax asset was 0.7m 1 May 2004: 0.8m.
Operating costs for the year ended 30 April 2005 have been reduced by 0.1m, net of tax, for the reduction in this accrual.
f Joint venture Under UK GAAP, the Group used the equity method to account for its investment in joint ventures.
The Group will account for joint ventures by proportionate consolidation under IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures.
g Associates Under IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, the share of the associates results included in the Groups profit before tax is stated after interest and tax.
The share of operating profit shown under UK GAAP excluded the associates interest and tax, with these items being shown within the Groups interest and tax charges.
This change had the effect of reducing profit before tax by 0.9m, being the amount of the tax charges of the associates: this had no effect on the profit attributable to shareholders.
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2006 91 36.
Explanation of transition to IFRS continued h Proposed dividends Under IAS 10, Events after the Balance Sheet Date, dividends declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date.
There were 22.4m of proposed dividends provided for at 30 April 2005 1 May 2004: 21.7m, which under adopted IFRSs were written back to retained earnings.
i Minority interests Under UK GAAP, losses in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are attributed to the minority.
However, under IAS 27, Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, losses applicable to the minority in excess of the minoritys interest in the subsidiarys equity are allocated against the majority, except to the extent that the minority has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to cover the losses.
Accordingly, accumulated losses at 1 May 2004 of 0.5m attributable to the minority interest were reallocated to equity holders of DS Smith Plc.
Subsequent losses of 0.4m attributable to the minority under UK GAAP during 2004 05 were also reallocated to equity holders of DS Smith Plc.
In addition, further to the above and the Groups decision to take advantage of the exemption under IFRS 1 not to apply IFRS 3 to acquisitions before the transition balance sheet date, goodwill arising on acquisition of further shares of a subsidiary with a minority interest was reduced by 1.4m at 30 April 2005 1 May 2004: nil.
The combined effect of the above is to reduce retained earnings to equity holders of DS Smith Plc by 1.9m, to reduce goodwill by 1.4m and to increase minority interest by 0.5m at 30 April 2005. j Reclassications Computer software Under UK GAAP, all capitalised computer software has been included within tangible xed assets.
Under IAS 38, Intangible Assets, only computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is included as property, plant and equipment with other software being classied as an intangible asset.
Accordingly, a reclassication was made of 7.4m 1 May 2004: 7.2m between property, plant and equipment and intangible assets at 30 April 2005.
Spare parts IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment, requires that parts which can be used only in connection with an item of property, plant and equipment, should be accounted for as property, plant and equipment.
On 30 April 2005, 2.3m of spare parts was treated as inventory under UK GAAP.
This was reclassied as property, plant and equipment.
There was no reclassication made at 1 May 2004.
Employee benets Under UK GAAP, the Groups pension obligations were disclosed net of the related deferred tax asset.
Under adopted IFRSs, pension liabilities are required to be shown gross of the related deferred tax asset.
Accordingly, 34.5m of deferred tax assets were reclassied between employee benets and deferred tax assets at 30 April 2005 1 May 2004: 23.4m.
k Financial instruments The effect of the adoption of IAS 32 and 39 at 1 May 2005 is set out in note 17 on page 68.
