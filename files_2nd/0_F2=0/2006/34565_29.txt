Notes to the Company accounts 87 Capital & Regional Annual Report 2006 A Accounting policies Although the Group consolidated accounts are prepared under IFRS, the Capital & Regional plc Company accounts presented in this section are prepared under UK GAAP.
Following the issue of several UK accounting standards intended to converge certain aspects of UK GAAP with IFRS, the accounting policies relevant to the Company are included within those set out in the Group accounting policies note 1, except for investment in subsidiaries, as described in note C below.
The new UK accounting standards are: FRS 20: Share based payments FRS 21: Events after the balance sheet date FRS 23: The effects of changes in foreign exchange rates FRS 25: Financial instruments: disclosure and presentation FRS 26: Financial instruments: measurement The effect of FRS 21 on the comparative figures is to exclude the 2005 proposed final dividend from the balance sheet and income statement.
Consequently, in respect of the year ended 30 December 2005, retained earnings and equity shareholders funds are increased by 7.7 million.
Under FRS25 the debt and equity components of convertible instruments are separate.
Previously the nominal value of the CULS was held as a liability in the balance sheet.
At 30 December 2005, the effect on retained earnings was a reduction of 0.3 million and an increase in equity shareholders funds of 1.1 million.
The restatement effect is shown in note G below.
