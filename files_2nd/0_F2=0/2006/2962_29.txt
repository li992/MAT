SELECTED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL DATA UNAUDITED Our revenues from the sale of passenger tickets are seasonal.
Historically, demand for cruises has been the greatest during our third quarter, which includes the Northern Hemisphere summer months.
This higher demand during the third quarter results in higher net revenue yields and, accordingly, the largest share of our net income is earned during this period.
The seasonality of our results is increased due to ships being taken out of service for maintenance, which we typically schedule during non-peak demand periods.
Substantially all of Holland America Tours and Princess Tours revenues and net income are generated from May through September in conjunction with the Alaska cruise season.
123 R of $17 million, $11 million, $13 million and $16 million for the quarters ended February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30, 2006, respectively.
b Includes a $23 million expense related to the MNOPF contribution and a $22 million expense for a non-cruise investment write-down.
