INVESTMENTS Subsidiary and associated undertakings 000 Cost: At 1 May 2005 435,066 Additions 12 At 30 April 2006 435,078 Provision for impairment: At 1 May 2005 15,254 Charge for the year - At 30 April 2006 15,254 Net book value: At 30 April 2006 419,824 At 30 April 2005 419,812 A loan of 539,000 to a subsidiary undertaking is included in the investment in subsidiary and associated undertakings.
The remainder of the investment is held in ordinary shares.
During the year ended 30 April 2004 the trade and net assets of one of the Companys subsidiary undertakings were transferred to another subsidiary undertaking at their book value which was less than their fair value.
The cost of the Companys investment in the transferor subsidiary reflected the underlying fair value of its net assets and goodwill at the time of the acquisition.
As a result of this transfer, the value of the Companys investment in the transferor subsidiary fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Companys accounting records.
Schedule 4 to the Companies Act 1985 requires that the investment be written down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Companys profit and loss account.
However, as the fall in value in the transferor subsidiary undertaking was offset by an increase in the value of the investment in the transferee subsidiary, the Directors consider that, as there has been no overall loss to the Company, it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Companys profit and loss account for that year.
The effect of this departure was to increase the Companys profit for the financial year ended 30 April 2004 by 2,425,000 and to increase the value of investments in subsidiary undertakings in the holding companys balance sheet by the same amount.
The Group accounts are not affected by this transfer.
