9 Goodwill and intangible assets indefinite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are expected to generate net cash inows.
These are considered to have an indefinite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the level of marketing support.
Brands that are classied as indefinite have been in the market for many years, and the nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported by advertising and marketing spend.
Finite-lived intangible assets, which primarily comprise patented and non-patented technology, know-how, and software, are capitalised and amortised in operating profit on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected useful lives, none of which exceeds ten years.
The level of amortisation for nitelived intangible assets is not expected to change materially over the next five years.

There are no significant carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets that are allocated across multiple cash generating units CGUs.
Impairments charges in the year The impairments charged in 2006 principally relate to planned business disposals that will be completed during 2007.
In 2006, Slim Fast was fully integrated into The Americas business as part of the North American beverage operations.
As a result of the integration, Slim Fast is no longer evaluated on a stand-alone basis but as part of the North American beverage CGU.
The 2006 impairment review on this basis and on a stand-alone basis did not result in any impairments 2005: 363 million: 2004: 791 million.
significant CGUs The goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets predominantly Knorr and Hellmanns held in the global savoury and dressings CGU, comprising 11.6 billion 2005: 11.9 billion and 3.4 billion 2005: 3.6 billion respectively, are considered significant in comparison to the total carrying amounts of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at 31 December 2006.
No other CGUs are considered significant in this respect.
During 2006, we conducted an impairment review of the carrying value of these assets.
Value in use of the global savoury and dressings CGU has been calculated as the present value of projected future cash ows.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% was used.
The following key assumptions were used in the discounted cash ow projections for the savoury and dressings CGU: a longer-term sustainable growth rate of 3%, adjusted for market fade, used to determine an appropriate terminal value multiple: average near-term nominal growth for the major product groups within the CGU of 3%: and average operating margins for the major product groups within the CGU ranging from 16% to 19%.
The growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on past performance and our experience of growth rates and margins achievable in our key markets as a guide.
We believe that the assumptions used in estimating the future performance of the savoury and dressings CGU are consistent with past performance.
The projections covered a period of ten years as we believe this to be a suitable timescale over which to review and consider annual performance before applying a xed terminal value multiple to the final year cash ows of the detailed projection.
Stopping the detailed projections after five years and applying a terminal value multiple thereafter would not result in a value in use that would cause impairment.
The growth rates used to estimate future performance beyond the periods covered by our annual planning and strategic planning processes do not exceed the long-term average rates of growth for similar products.
We have performed sensitivity analysis around the base case assumptions and have concluded that no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount of the global savoury and dressings CGU to be less than the carrying amount.
