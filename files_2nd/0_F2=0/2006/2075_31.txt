c Valesul Aluminio SA is presented as held for sale following the completion of a divestment review by the Group.
Refer to note 14. d While BHP Billiton legally holds a 57.5 per cent interest in Minera Escondida Limitada, the entity is subject to effective joint control due to participant and management agreements which results in the operation of an Owners Council, whereby significant commercial and operational decisions are determined on aggregate voting interests of at least 75% of the total ownership interest.
Therefore the BHP Billiton Group does not have the ability to unilaterally control, and therefore consolidate, the investment in accordance with IAS 27 AASB 127 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements.
