RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS Defined Benefit Schemes The Group has two 2005 three funded final salary pension schemes which provide defined benefits based on final pensionable pay.
The schemes are subject to independent valuations at least every three years.
The future benefit obligations are valued by actuarial methods on the basis of an appropriate assessment of the relevant parameters.
On 1 February 2006, the third group scheme, Keadby Generation Limited KGL a group within the Electricity Supply Pension Scheme ESPS, which was acquired at July 2004 as part of the acquisition of the Fiddlers Ferry and Ferrybridge power stations, became part of the Southern Electric group of the ESPS.
This reduced the number of defined benefit schemes from three to two.
On 12 January 2005, the Group also acquired a part of the business of Alfred McAlpine referred to as Eastern Contracting.
The liabilities under the associated pension scheme and the agreed asset values were part of the valuation of the Southern Electric scheme from that point.
The Group also has an unapproved unfunded retirement benefit plan and a personal pension scheme.
The personal pension scheme is a money purchase scheme whereby the Group matches the members contributions up to a maximum of 6% of salary.
The scheme is managed by Friends Provident.
