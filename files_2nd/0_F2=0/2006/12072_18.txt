Restricted Share Plan RSP During the year, the Company established a Restricted Share Plan RSP for senior employees other than the directors of the Company.
Under the scheme, senior employees are granted shares in the Company over a restricted vesting period which may or may not be, at the direction of the Remuneration Committee of the Board of directors, subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions.
At present there are no performance conditions applying to this scheme nor is there currently any intention to introduce them in the future.
The fair value of the awards granted under the plan at various grant dates during the year is based on a weighted average quoted price of 278p over the period with an assumed vesting rate of 91% per annum over the three year vesting period.
The Company awarded 161,101 shares to participants in the scheme during the year and recognised a charge of US$79,000 in the current year income statement.
At 31 December 2006, there were still 161,101 share awards outstanding but not exercisable at this date.
The group has recognised a total charge of US$1,281,000 in the income statement during the year relating to the above employee share-based schemes note 4f.
