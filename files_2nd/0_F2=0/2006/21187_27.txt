Aviva plc Financial statements continued Annual Report and Accounts 2006 214 Financial statements of the Company continued Notes to the Company financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2006 A Change in accounting policy In August 2005, the IASB issued an amendment to IAS 39, Financial Guarantee Contracts, which requires financial guarantees issued to be recognised initially at their fair value, and subsequently measured at the higher of the expected liability or receivable under the guarantee and the amount initially recognised less any cumulative amortisation.
Whilst not material at the Company or consolidated Group level, the amendment affects the Companys subsidiaries in respect of intercompany guarantees given and taken in the ordinary course of business, where guarantee fees had not necessarily reflected the fair value to each party of the issued instrument.
This value must now be reflected in each entitys financial statements, and will result in additional accruals for fee income and prepayments for fees payable in the balance sheets of the affected companies, with movements in these values credited or charged to profit in the relevant income statements.
The amendment is effective for the year ended 31 December 2006 and the impact at a Company level was immaterial.
B Investments in subsidiaries i Movements in the Companys investments in its subsidiaries are as follows: 2006 2005 mm Fair value as at 1 January 22,919 19,538 Additions 1,562 2,973 Disposals 670 1,113 Movement in fair value 4,075 1,521 At 31 December 27,886 22,919 As explained in note 3 a iv of the consolidated financial statements, the Company raised 892 million, net of transaction costs, in July 2006 through the placing of new ordinary shares in connection with the acquisition of AmerUs Group Co. On 2 November 2006, the Company transferred this sum to AGH in return for the issue to it of further new shares in AGH for this amount, which is also included in Additions in the table above.
As part of the ongoing Group restructuring, the Company acquired all the shares in Norwich Union Limited from General Accident plc GA in December 2005.
The acquisition was at fair value, settled via an intercompany loan, and gave rise to a profit on disposal in GA.
The Company carries its investment in GA at its fair value less the balance on this loan.
In April 2006, GA declared a dividend of 6,380 million which has been settled against the loan.
This does not result in any further impairment of the Companys net investment in GA and therefore the dividend has not been reflected through the income statement.
On 31 July 2006, the Company transferred its entire shareholding in CGNU Holdings Australia Limited renamed Undershaft No 1 Limited on 12 July 2006 at its fair value to Norwich Union Holdings Limited since renamed Aviva Group Holdings Limited AGH.
This gave rise to a profit on disposal of 94 million.
The consideration of 670 million was satisfied by the issue of new shares in AGH to the Company for this amount, which is included in Additions in the table above.
At 31 December 2006, the Company has three wholly-owned subsidiaries, all incorporated in Great Britain.
These are General Accident plc, Norwich Union Limited and Aviva Group Holdings Limited.
Aviva Group Holdings Limited is an intermediate holding company, whilst General Accident plc and Norwich Union Limited no longer carry out this function.
The principal subsidiaries of the Aviva Group at 31 December 2006 are listed on pages 244 to 245.
C Operating expenses i Operating expenses comprise: 2006 2005 m m Staff costs and other employee related expenditure 87 62 Other operating costs 71 120 Net foreign exchange losses gains 43 22 At 31 December 201 160 ii Total staff costs were: 2006 2005 m m Wages and salaries 53 43 Social security costs 6 5 Post-retirement obligations Defined benefit schemes see iii below 6 7 Defined contribution schemes 2 Profit sharing and incentive plans 1 Equity compensation plans see iv below 17 6 Termination benefits 2 1 At 31 December 87 62 Overview Business review Governance Financial statements Other information Aviva plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 215 C Operating expenses continued iii Pension costs The Company is one of a number of UK companies being charged for its employees participating in the Aviva Staff Pension Scheme, and its contributions are affected by the financial position of the scheme.
There is no contractual agreement or policy for charging the net defined benefit cost for this scheme across the participating Group entities but, instead, this cost is recognised in the financial statements of the main UK employing company.
The Company therefore recognises a pension expense equal to its contributions payable in the year for its staff, together with the service cost of any unfunded benefits, within staff costs above.
Full disclosure on the Groups pension schemes is given in note 42. iv Equity compensation plans All transactions in the Groups equity compensation plans involve options and awards for ordinary shares of the Company.
Full disclosure of these plans is given in note 28.
The cost of such options and awards is borne by all participating businesses and, where relevant, the Company bears an appropriate charge.
As the majority of the charge to the Company relates to directors options and awards, for which full disclosure is made in the Directors remuneration report, no further disclosure is given here on the grounds of immateriality.

The placing structure utilised attracted merger relief under section 131 of the Companies Act 1985, resulting in a credit to the merger reserve of 871 million.
Subsequent internal transactions required to complete the placing structure have resulted in this part of the merger reserve being realised.
Consequently, a transfer of 871 million has been made from the merger reserve to retained earnings.
