Contingent liabilities 2006 2005 million million Contingent liabilities 20 20 Litigation and environmental liabilities Contingent liabilities relate mainly to obligations arising from legal proceedings and environmental remediation activities, which, in the opinion of the directors, are not expected to have a materially adverse effect on the Group.
The Group is engaged in a number of legal proceedings relating to patent and other claims under contracts.
The Group is vigorously defending these cases, the estimated cost of which is disclosed above, and the directors currently believe that the claims are unlikely to be settled for amounts resulting in material cash or other asset outflows.
The Group is also engaged in a number of remediation activities at various sites, the costs of which are fully provided for.
It is possible that the remediation works at those sites could take longer to complete than expected, that additional contamination could be discovered, or that the governmental agencies involved could change their policy and require remediation to a higher standard than required at present, the estimated costs of which is disclosed above.
The directors currently believe that the remediation works are unlikely to require expenditure resulting in material cash or other asset outflows other than in accordance with the provisions held.
Guarantees At 31 March 2006, the Group had provided third parties with a total of 118 million of guarantees, performance bonds and indemnities, the exercise of which is considered to be remote.
At 31 March 2006, the value of total collateral against these various guarantees was 41 million.
In addition, we estimate that 71 million of the guarantees had varying conditional and unconditional rights to call for cash collateral.
telent Bonding Limited, a Group subsidiary, has available to it a committed bonding facility for 35 million until November 2007.
Under the terms of the facility telent Bonding Limited provides 50% cash collateral to the bonding provider.
The provider has unconditional rights to call for the balance, up to 100% cash collateral, at any time.
A maturity profile of all bonds and guarantees outstanding is set out below: Bonds Bonds outstanding outstanding at 31 March at 31 March 2006 2005 million million Expiring 31 March 2006 or earlier 54 2007 93 57 2008 7 7 2009 2 Thereafter 12 9 No expiry date 4 10 118 137 35.
Post-retirement benefits During the period to 23 January 2006, the Group operated defined benefit pension plans in the UK, USA, Germany and Italy, and post-retirement benefit plans in the USA.
On 23 January 2006, the Group disposed of its Telecommunications Equipment and International Services businesses to Ericsson.
The impact of this was a 60 million settlement gain on the transfer of overseas pension plans to Ericsson, which was offset by a cost of 61 million on transferring the plans to Ericsson, and a 4 million curtailment gain on the G. E. C. 1972 Plan the UK Pension Plan.
The most significant plan remaining with the Group is the UK Pension Plan.
A full actuarial valuation for the UK Pension Plan was carried out as at 5 April 2005 and a valuation for accounting purposes was carried out as at 31 March 2006 by independent qualified actuaries.
For the US plans, full actuarial valuations were carried out at 1 January 2004 and 1 January 2005 and were updated as applicable to 31 March 2006 for accounting purposes by independent qualified actuaries.
For the German unfunded plans, valuations were carried out for accounting purposes at 31 March 2006 by independent qualified actuaries.
Both the US and German plans were split between Ericsson and telent as a result of the disposal.
This split was based on the number of active members whose employment was transferred to Ericsson.
For the Italian unfunded plan, a valuation was carried out for accounting purposes at 31 December 2005 by independent qualified actuaries, prior to the transfer of the entire plan to Ericsson on 23 January 2006.
The contributions made to the plans in the year totalled 202 million 2005: 17 million.
Benefit payments in the year totalled 5 million 2005: 9 million.
For the unfunded pension plans and the post-retirement medical plans, payments are made when the benefits are provided.
Company contributions to the UK Pension Plan were 8.20% of pensionable pay in the year to 31 March 2006, and will increase to 8.35% in the next financial year.
In addition, the Company will directly pay the costs of administration of the UK Pension Plan and the newly introduced Pension Protection Fund levy.
The Group also made a voluntary contribution of 185 million into the UK Pension Plan in March 2006 to reduce the plan deficit.
