Segment assets comprise all non-current and current assets as per the balance sheet but exclude deferred tax assets and cash and cash equivalents.
Segment liabilities include trade and other payables, provisions and post-employment obligations but exclude borrowings and taxation liabilities.
Cash and cash equivalents and borrowings are not allocated to specic segments as these resources are managed centrally and no business in any segment has sufficient autonomy to manage these resources.
Segment capital expenditure is the total cost incurred during the year to acquire segment assets that are expected to be used for more than one year.

The rationalisation of UK facilities generated a net surplus of 3 million which included land disposal surpluses amounting to 6 million.
Prior year actions include the impact of restructuring actions at GKN Driveline Torque Technology KK which involved announced headcount reductions 1 million, property impairments 4 million relating to site rationalisations and a pension settlement credit of 7 million arising from the negotiated withdrawal from a multi-employer dened benefit pension scheme.
The 2005 pension settlement credit arises from a provision originally established in the fair value acquisition balance sheet.
Other redundancy costs in 2005 amounted to 5 million.
iv Research and development expenditure in subsidiaries was 75 million 2005 88 million.
72 GKN plc Annual Report 2006 v Auditors remuneration The analysis of auditors remuneration is as follows: 2006 2005 m m Fees payable to  LLP for the Companys annual financial statements 0.5 0.5 Fees payable to  LLP and their associates for other services to the Group Audit of the Companys subsidiaries pursuant to legislation 2.8 2.9 Total audit fees 3.3 3.4 Other services pursuant to legislation 0.1 0.9 Tax services 0.6 0.7 Corporate finance transaction services 0.1 Other services 0.1 0.1 Total non-audit fees 0.9 1.7 Fees payable to  LLP and their associates in respect of associated pension schemes Audit Other services All fees payable to  LLP, the Companys auditors, include amounts in respect of expenses.
No amount included above includes the estimated value of benets in kind.
All fees payable to  LLP have been charged to the income statement except for those in relation to associated pension schemes, which are borne by the respective schemes, and 0.1 million in 2006 which has been capitalised as it relates to the Groups assessment of its current year acquisitions and is therefore a directly attributable expense of the acquisition.

Charges recognised in the year in respect of this programme amount to 63 million 2005 77 million which comprises asset impairment charges of 2 million 2005 36 million, redundancy costs, including pension past service charges and curtailment credits, of 35 million 2005 28 million net of post-employment curtailments, 5 million and other reorganisation costs of 26 million 2005 13 million.
Pension past service charges net of curtailment credits amount to 3 million in 2006.
An analysis by segment and description of the charges is set out below: 2006 2005 Asset impairments Reorganisation reversals Redundancy costs Total Total m m m m m Driveline 3211337 46 Powder Metallurgy 1 14 11 24 28 OffHighway 2 Corporate 2 2 1 2352663 77 Annual Report 2006 GKN plc 73 Notes to the financial statements continued 3 Operating profit continued Restructuring charges in Driveline in 2006 arise primarily from the continuation of the plant closures announced in North America and Western Europe in 2005, continued reductions in the level of xed cost headcount primarily in European plants and initial charges recognised on the announced cessation of the Driveshaft operations in a European Driveline plant.
Redundancy costs provided for represent charges for contractual severance and other employee related exit benets and post-employment augmentations and curtailments.
Reorganisation costs include charges in respect of onerous lease, property and other contracts, incremental costs borne by the Group as a consequence of dedicated restructuring and transition teams and equipment relocation costs attributable to the transfer of equipment between closing facilities and continuing operations and incremental premium freight and product homologation costs.
Asset impairment charges are in respect of the irrecoverable value of plant and machinery not transferable to other facilities or recoverable from disposal: write-downs of property, surplus to requirements as a consequence of the restructuring, to estimated realisable value and the impairment of dedicated consumable inventories that will not be utilised by the operation in the period up to closure and or cessation of operations.
Powder Metallurgy charges arise as a consequence of the Board approved closure of five plants.
Charges comprise the cost of redundancies, contractual severance payments and other employee related obligations where irrevocable external announcements had been made in the year.
Reorganisation costs include surplus property costs, incremental transition team costs and equipment relocation and maintenance charges attributable to transfers to continuing facilities.
As a consequence of detailed restructuring actions taken in 2006 asset impairments recognised in 2005 have been reversed as alternative productive use has been found for certain plant and equipment not originally envisaged or anticipated.
Charges in respect of the Corporate operations primarily represents onerous lease and other contract provisions recognised resulting from the announced closure of the Groups current London ofce and centralisation of headquarters operations in one principal facility.
The cash outow in 2006 in respect of the Groups strategic restructuring programme amounts to 57 million 2005 36 million.
In addition the Group has spent 1 million 2005 2 million on the final phases of restructuring programmes commenced prior to 2004 and which were disclosed as exceptional items under UK GAAP.
No charges and or credits were recognised in the 2006 and 2005 income statement in respect of these historical programmes, and no material provisions remain unutilised as at 31 December 2006.
2005 restructuring charges comprise asset impairments 36 million, redundancy charges 28 million and reorganisation costs 13 million.
The analysis of 2005 restructuring by segment is also set out in note 2.
Other impairments In addition to impairment charges borne as a consequence of strategic restructuring activities, a 11 million 2005 11 million impairment charge has arisen in 2006 relating to the write down of goodwill at a Driveline business where, as a consequence of current and future trading performance and projections specic to a customer relationship, sufficient doubt exists over the recoverability.
The impairment review was carried out with reference to both value in use and fair value recoverabilities.
Further detail regarding the goodwill impairment of 11 million 2005 11 million is given in note 10.
The remaining 10 million impairment in 2005 related to property, plant and equipment in the UK cylinder liner business within the Other Automotive segment where, during 2005, a decision was made to transfer certain production to a new Chinese facility.
This fact and continued declining profitability led to the significant impairment charge.
c Amortisation of non-operating intangible assets arising on business combinations In establishing the fair value of assets and liabilities arising on business combinations the Group identies the fair values attributable to intangible assets.
The intangible assets recognised include operating intangibles, predominantly computer software, and non-operating intangibles being the value in respect of brands and trademarks, intellectual property rights, customer contracts and relationships and proprietary technology rights and know-how.
All intangibles recognised on business combinations are amortised over their expected useful economic lives.
Details of the lives used are set out in the Groups accounting policies and note 10 to these financial statements.
The amortisation of non-operating intangibles is separately identied as a component of operating profit on the face of the income statement.
The analysis below sets out the amortisation charge in the period by category of non-operating intangible asset.

At this point the Groups control of and active participation in the Fujiwa business ceased.
The net cash inow arising on disposal is set out below: m Net assets disposed 19 Minority interests 8 Cumulative translation adjustment 1 Surplus arising on disposal 5 Consideration receivable net of attributable expenses 15 In the period to disposal Fujiwa contributed 5 million 2005 34 million to Group sales, 1 million 2005 4 million to Group trading profit and nil million 2005 5 million to cash generated from operations.
The Other profit recognised in 2005 reects the cash receipt in respect of a contingent earn out arrangement on the 2004 disposal of an Aerospace business.
e Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments IAS 39 requires derivative financial instruments to be valued at the date of the balance sheet and any difference between that value and the intrinsic value of the instrument to be reected in the balance sheet as an asset or liability.
Any subsequent change in value is reected in the income statement unless hedge accounting is achieved.
Such movements do not affect cash ow or the economic substance of the underlying transaction.
In 2006 the Group used transactional hedge accounting in a limited number of instances.
The Group did not attempt to achieve transactional hedge accounting in 2005.
As a consequence, and to assist year-on-year comparison, the change in value continues to be identied as a separate element of operating profit.
Details of the charges and credits to 2006 operating profit are set out in note 23.

This requires an estimation of the current tax liability together with an assessment of the temporary differences which arise as a consequence of different accounting and tax treatments.
These temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities which are measured using substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply when the temporary differences reverse.
Recognition of deferred tax assets, and hence credits to the income statement are based on forecast future taxable income and therefore involves judgement regarding future financial performance of particular legal entities or tax groups in which the deferred tax assets are recognised.
The Group is subject to many tax jurisdictions and rules as a consequence of its global reach, and therefore is subject to tax audits, which by their nature are often complex and can require several years to conclude.
Management judgement is therefore required to determine the total provision for income tax.
Amounts set aside and released in any period are based on management judgement and interpretation of country specic tax law and the likelihood of crystallisation and settlement.
However, as amounts set aside in any period could differ from actual tax liabilities incurred, adjustments are required in subsequent periods which may have a material impact on the Groups income statement and or cash tax payment.
Payments in respect of tax liabilities for an accounting period result from payments on account and on the final resolution of open items with tax authorities.
As a result, there can be substantial differences between the charge in the income statement and tax cash payments.
Tax benets are not recognised unless it is probable that the tax positions are sustainable.
Interest on tax liabilities is provided for in the tax charge.
Details of the effective tax rate for the Group and the underlying events and transactions affecting this and the tax charge are given in the business review on page 13.

Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share are calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The Company has only one category of dilutive potential ordinary shares: share options.
The calculation is performed for the share options to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

The amount outstanding at 31 December 2006 in respect of annual short-term variable remuneration was 2 million 2005 1 million.
Post-employment benets represent the charge to trading profit under IAS 19 attributable to key management arising in the year and the attributable cost of post-employment medical benets.
Termination benets include redundancy, pension augmentations and ex gratia payments arising in connection with loss of ofce and termination of employment with the Group.
Share-based payments represents the annual charge attributable to key management in respect of their participation in the Groups share-based remuneration arrangements: details of the nature of these arrangements are set out in note 9 and in the remuneration report.

9 Share-based payments The Group has granted options over shares to employees for a number of years under different schemes.
Where grants were made after 7 November 2002 they have been accounted for as required by IFRS 2 Share-based payments.
As permitted by the transitional arrangements of that standard, awards made before that date have not been so accounted.
All options have been valued at the date of grant by an independent third party using a Monte Carlo model which uses the same principle as a binomial model.
Details of awards made since 7 November 2002 are: a Employee Sharesave Scheme In September 2003 the Company awarded options to UK employees under an approved Sharesave scheme the terms of which were that the employee entered into regular savings commitment up to a maximum of 250 per month for a three year period.
The cumulative savings were then used to acquire options over a number of shares at a 10% discount to market price at the date of grant.
There were no performance conditions but, in general, the employee must remain in employment for the three year period.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 229p, volatility 38%, expected dividend yield 4.3%, risk free interest rate 4.49% and a term of 3.25 years.
There have been no further awards since September 2003. b Executive Share Option Schemes ESOS Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004, April 2005 and April 2006 under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes options were granted with a xed exercise price equal to the market price at the date of grant and subject to meeting performance conditions over a three year period.
In the case of the 2001 scheme, the performance condition was based on earnings per share EPS growth whilst under the 2004 scheme the condition is based on Total Shareholder Return TSR compared with that of comparator companies.
Under the 2001 scheme only, where the performance condition is not satisfied in full after the first three years, retesting is carried out each year up to six years from the date of grant.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price 163p to 334.05p, volatility 32% to 38%, expected dividend yield 3.7% to 6.2%, risk free interest rate 4.28% to 4.92% and expected terms of 6.4 years to 6.7 years.
c Long Term Incentive Plans LTIP Awards were made to Directors and certain senior employees in March 2003 under the 2001 scheme and in September 2004 and April 2006 under the 2004 scheme.
In April 2005 awards were made to Directors under the 2004 scheme.
Under both schemes, options were granted subject to TSR performance over a three year period compared with a comparator group.
There is no retest facility under either scheme.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility 23% to 39%, expected dividend yield 3.7% to 6.2%, risk free interest rate 4.05% to 4.94% and a term of 3 years to 4 years 9.5 months.
Further details of both ESOS and LTIP schemes are given in the remuneration report on pages 54 and 55.
Annual Report 2006 GKN plc 79 Notes to the financial statements continued 9 Share-based payments continued d Bonus Co-Investment Plan Under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan, certain senior employees excluding Directors are entitled to use up to 10% of their gross short-term annual bonus potential to purchase shares in the Company at market price.
Provided they remain in employment for three years and the shares are retained for that period the Company matches those shares.
For shares purchased by employees in 2004 the match was on a two for one basis and in 2005 was two and a half for one.
In addition, in 2005 there was a further one for one match if certain profit targets are achieved.
No entitlements under the Bonus Co-Investment Plan arose in 2006.
All shares under the scheme are purchased in the open market.
Inputs to the valuation model were: option price nil, volatility, where applicable, 37%, expected dividend yield 4.9% to 5.4%, risk free interest rate, where applicable, 4.94% and a term of 3 years.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over a period commensurate with the term of the awards.
The risk free interest rate is the rate obtainable from government securities over the expected life of the equity incentive.
The total charge for the year relating to share-based payment plans was 5 million 2005 1 million all of which related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
After deferred tax, the total charge was 5 million 2005 1 million.
Liabilities in respect of share-based payments were not material at either 31 December 2006 or 31 December 2005.
There were no vested rights to cash or other assets at either 31 December 2006 or 31 December 2005.

Details of the intangible assets considered and arising on the current year business combinations is set out in note 28 to these financial statements.
The following useful lives have been determined for Other intangible assets: Years Operating intangibles Computer software 3 to 5 Non-recurring design and development costs in Aerospace businesses 3 to 15 Non-operating intangibles Brands trademarks 30 to 50 Intellectual property rights arising on business combinations 5 to 10 Customer contracts and relationships 5 to 15 Proprietary technology and know-how 7 to 10 The net book value of Other intangible assets includes non-recurring costs consisting of design and development on major aerospace contracts of 50 million 2005 33 million, computer software 17 million 2005 17 million, intellectual property rights arising from business combinations of 3 million 2005 4 million, brands trademarks 3 million 2005 nil, customer and contractual relationships 30 million 2005 nil and proprietary technology and know-how 7 million 2005 nil.
Intangible assets acquired in relation to production order backlog are included within customer contracts and relationships.
No individual Other intangible asset is material to the Group.
Computer software under finance leases amounts to 1 million 2005 1 million.
Impairment During the year, all goodwill was tested for impairment.
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of the assets of a business or cash generating unit CGU to their recoverable amount.
Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an impairment results.
Following the impairment tests, a goodwill impairment of 11 million 2005 11 million was recognised within operating profit.
This charge relates to goodwill directly identiable with cash ows arising within the Driveline segment in the Asia Pacic region attributable to a specic customer relationship.
In this instance the current and forecast performance is lower than previously expected.
The pre-tax discount rate used for this impairment review was 9.0% 2005 8.5%.
For the purposes of carrying out impairment tests, the Groups total goodwill has been allocated to a number of CGUs and each of these CGUs has been separately assessed and tested.
The allocation of goodwill by business segment is set out in note 2 as well as below.
The size of a CGU varies but is never larger than a primary or secondary reportable segment.
In some cases, the CGU is an individual subsidiary or operation.
The only amount of goodwill allocated to an individual CGU which is significant to total Group goodwill is that attributable to a US Aerospace business of 68 million 2005 78 million.
All of the recoverable amounts were measured based on value in use except for current year acquisitions where market values have been used.
Detailed forecasts for the next five years have been used in the majority of impairment tests except where a longer-term more detailed forecast is available and appropriate.
These forecasts are based on approved budgets and represent a best estimate of future performance.
A number of key assumptions have been made as a basis for the impairment tests.
In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reecting past experience and are consistent with relevant external sources of information and these are set out below.
Where a reasonably possible change to an assumption would lead to an impairment, a sensitivity analysis has been provided which quanties the amount of change required for an impairment to result.
Annual Report 2006 GKN plc 81 Notes to the financial statements continued 10 Intangible assets continued Total Group Discount rates A relative risk adjustment or beta has been applied to discount rates to reect the risk inherent in specic CGUs.
In determining the risk adjusted discount rate, management have applied an adjustment for risk of such companies relative to all other sectors on average, determined using an average of the betas of comparable listed companies.
Except for operations in Brazil and India, where rates of 21.75% and 15.5% respectively have been factored into impairment models, the risk adjusted pre-tax discount range of rates set out below have been used for impairment testing.
The range of rates reects the mix of currencies within CGUs within the segments.
Driveline 9.0% to 14.25% Powder Metallurgy 9.50% to 12.50% OffHighway 10.75% to 12.50% Aerospace 9.25% to 12.25% Long-term growth rates To forecast beyond the five years covered by detailed forecasts, a long-term average growth rate has been used.
In each case, this is not greater than the published Oxford Economic Forcast average growth rate in gross domestic product for the next five year period in the territory or territories where the CGU is primarily based.
This results in a range of real growth rates from 2.4% 2005 1.1% for Japan, to 7.9% 2005 6.0% for India, with most other countries between 2.0% and 4.0% in both years.
Nominal growth rates used in the calculations ranged from 2.8% to 13.6%.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis In order to gauge sensitivity to likely and potential changes in discount rates and long-term growth rates the impact of a 1% increase and or decrease in each rate in isolation was reviewed.
In no instance does such a change result in an impairment in segmental goodwill balances which as at 31 December 2006 were Driveline 62 million, Powder Metallurgy 24 million, OffHighway 35 million and Aerospace 124 million.
Driveline In determining the recoverable amount of Driveline CGUs, it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate future cash ows.
The main assumptions include discount rates, long-term growth rates, future sales prices and volumes with reference to specic customer relationships and product lines, a realistic estimate of new business, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise benets from annual productivity improvements.
Assumptions have also been made regarding input costs, including steel prices.
It is not considered that a reasonably possible change in any of these assumptions would generate a different impairment test outcome to the one included in this annual report.
Aerospace In addition to the discount rate and long-term growth rate, the key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount of Aerospace CGUs were specic volumes on certain US military and civil programmes, the achievement of forecast selling prices, the cost structure of each CGU and the ability to realise planned productivity improvements.
Other segments For the remaining impairment tests, key assumptions related to sales volumes and prices, raw material input costs and achieving benets from annual productivity improvements.

This corporation operates under a proxy agreement with the United States Department of Defense developing high technology, classied products for the Joint Strike Fighter.
The agreement currently places significant restrictions on the Groups management and control of the business for the life of the contract so that, in accordance with IAS 27, it has been excluded from the consolidation and treated as an investment.
The investment, which is fully provided, is stated at cost less provision for diminution.
At 31 December 2006, the excluded net liabilities were 4 million 2005 3 million and the operating loss for the year then ended was 1 million 2005 1 million.
During the year, the Group provided engineering and design services to GKN Aerospace Services Structures Corp. which amounted to less than 1 million 2005 1 million.

For bank and other loans carrying xed rates of interest included within long-term borrowings, the repayments which the Group is committed to make have been discounted at the relevant interest rates applicable at 31 December 2006.
Bonds included within long-term borrowings have been valued using quoted closing market values.
22 Financial risk management The Groups multinational operations and debt nancing expose it to a variety of financial risks that include the effects of changes in debt market prices, foreign exchange rates, credit risks, liquidity and interest rates.
The Group has in place risk management policies that seek to limit the adverse effects on the financial performance of the Group by using various instruments and techniques including foreign currency financial instruments, debt and other interest rate derivatives.
Risk management policies have been set by the Board and applied by the Group and are implemented by the central Treasury Department that receives regular reports from all the operating companies to enable prompt identication of financial risks so that appropriate actions may be taken.
The Treasury Department has a policy and procedures manual that sets out specic guidelines to manage foreign exchange risks, interest rate risk, credit risk and the use of financial instruments to manage these.
a Foreign exchange risk The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases by operating subsidiaries in currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency.
Under the Groups foreign exchange policy, such transaction exposures are hedged once they are known, mainly through the use of forward foreign exchange contracts.
The mark to market maturity prole of forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2006 is less than one year 12 million 2005 5 million, between one and five years 13 million 2005 9 million and over five years 2 million 2005 1 million.
The Group has a significant investment in overseas operations, particularly in continental Europe and the Americas.
As a result, the sterling value of the Groups balance sheet can be affected by movements in exchange rates.
The Group therefore seeks to mitigate the effect of these translational currency exposures by matching the net investment in overseas operations with borrowings denominated in their functional currencies, except where significant adverse interest differentials or other factors would render the cost of such hedging activity uneconomic.
This is achieved by borrowing either directly in either the local domestic or euro-currency markets, or indirectly through the use of rolling annual forward foreign exchange contracts.
Borrowings created through the use of such contracts amounted to 699 million at 31 December 2006 2005 631 million.
88 GKN plc Annual Report 2006 b Interest rate risk The Group operates an interest rate policy designed to optimise interest cost and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
This policy is achieved by maintaining a target range of xed and oating rate debt for discrete annual periods, over a dened time horizon.
This is achieved partly through the xed rate character of the underlying debt instrument, and partly through the use of straightforward derivatives forward rate agreements.
The Groups normal policy is to require interest rates to be xed for 30% to 70% of the level of underlying borrowings forecast to arise over a 12 month horizon.
However, this policy was suspended in December 2004 as it was deemed inappropriate given the absence of oating rate bank debt following the receipt of the sale proceeds of GKNs share in AgustaWestland.
At 31 December 2006 91% 2005 89% of the Groups gross borrowings were subject to xed interest rates.
The Group continues to be partly funded by xed rate borrowings 701 million that are exposed to fair value interest rate risk.
As at 31 December 2006 188 million 2005 576 million was on deposit with various banks and in money market funds of which 163 million 2005 542 million was on deposit in the UK.
A 1% change in interest rates would have a 2 million impact on profit before tax.
c Credit risk Financial The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-performance by counterparties to financial instruments.
Credit risk is mitigated by the Groups policy of only selecting counterparties with a strong investment graded long-term credit rating, normally at least AA or equivalent, and assigning financial limits to individual counterparties.
The maximum exposure with a single bank for deposits is 40 million, whilst the maximum mark to market exposure for forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2006 to a single bank was 6 million 2005 2 million.
Operational As tier one suppliers to both automotive and aerospace manufacturers the Group may have substantial amounts outstanding with a single customer at any one time.
There are many advantages in these relationships and the credit risk is managed at a number of levels.
Debtor days and overdue accounts are reported to divisional management who co-ordinate any action required, and overall divisional performance is regularly reviewed by the Groups Executive Committee.
As at 31 December 2006 no individual outstanding balance exceeded 1% of sales.
d Liquidity risk The Group actively maintains committed facilities that are designed to ensure the Group has sufficient available funds for operations and planned expansions.
Committed bank facilities of 350 million expire in July 2010 and were undrawn at the year end.
23 Derivative financial instruments This note should be read in conjunction with note 22 Financial risk management and the accounting policies.
2006 2005 Amounts included in operating profit comprise: m m Forward currency and commodity contracts 38 42 Embedded derivatives 5 9 33 33 2006 2005 Assets Liabilities Assets Liabilities Amounts included in the balance sheet comprise: m m m m Forward currency and commodity contracts 29 2 11 23 Embedded derivatives 2 7 1 1 Net investment hedges 1 2 10 32 11 12 34 Amounts in respect of forward currency contracts include all contracts irrespective of whether transactional hedge accounting applies.
In 2006 the Group adopted transactional hedge accounting in a limited number of cases.
In 2005 the Group did not seek to adopt transactional hedge accounting.
The amounts in respect of embedded derivatives primarily represent the movement between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2006 or date of maturity in the value of the embedded derivatives in commercial contracts between European Aerospace subsidiaries and customers and suppliers outside the USA which are denominated in US dollars, where the dollar is not routinely used, as dened by IAS 39, in such contractual arrangements.
Forward exchange contracts and currency swaps are marked to market using published prices.

Amounts are only set aside when irrevocable commitments exist at the balance sheet date and these invariably reect actual or constructive contractual arrangements which indicates the amount and most likely timing of ows.
Warranty Provisions set aside for warranty exposures either relate to monies provided systematically based on historical experience under contractual warranty obligations attaching to the supply of goods or specic provisions created in respect of individual customer issues undergoing commercial resolution and negotiation.
Amounts set aside represent managements best estimates of the likely settlement and the timing of any resolution with the relevant customer.
Legal and environmental Legal provisions amounting to 8 million 2005 11 million relate to management estimates of amounts required to settle or remove litigation actions that have arisen in the normal course of business.
Further details are not provided to avoid the potential of seriously prejudicing the Groups stance in law.
Amounts unused and reversed only arise when the matter is formally settled or when a material change in the litigation action occurs where legal advice confirms lower amounts need to be retained to cover the exposure.
As a consequence of primarily legacy activities, a small number of sites in the Group are subject to environmental remediation actions, which in all cases are either agreed formally with relevant local and national authorities and agencies or represent managements view of the likely outcome having taken appropriate expert advice and following consultation with appropriate authorities and agencies.
Amounts charged and carried reect the current best estimates of the likely cost of remediation and inherent timings.
Other Other provisions include amounts set aside in terms of insurance provisions held within the Groups captive insurance company 10 million 2005 9 million, provisions held in respect of onerous loss making contracts 9 million 2005 14 million, and long service and non-pension benefit employee obligations arising primarily in the Groups continental European subsidiaries 12 million 2005 11 million.
Insurance provisions and charges are established in accordance with external insurance and actuarial advice.
The onerous loss making contract provisions relate to specic non-cancellable contractual commitments where it is anticipated that unavoidable net operating losses will arise.

Annual Report 2006 GKN plc 93 Notes to the financial statements continued 28 Acquisitions 2006 Acquisitions During 2006 the Group has completed five acquisitions as detailed below: a Acquisition on 14 September of the trade and assets of Stellex Aerostructures Stellex, a manufacturer of aerospace titanium structures and industrial hinges based in the United States of America, for a fair value consideration of 93 million.
b Acquisition on 2 August of Rockford Powertrain Rockford, a US off-highway business supplying high speed driveshafts for application in the construction and mining industries, for a fair value consideration of 29 million.
c Acquisition on 16 November of the trade and assets of Liuzhou Steel Rim Factory Liuzhou, a Chinese manufacturer of wheels for agricultural and construction equipment, forklift trucks and harbour cranes, for a fair value consideration of 6 million.
d Acquisitions on 2 January 2006 and 1 June 2006 respectively of the trade and assets of Cramer Kupplung GmbH, a German manufacturer and distributor of off-highway hitches, and the trade and assets of Hytecomp AB, a Swedish distributor of off-highway hydraulic valves.
The combined fair value consideration of these two minor acquisitions was 2 million.
All transactions have been accounted for by the purchase method of accounting.
Fair values on all acquisitions in 2006 remain provisional except for those in relation to Cramer Kupplung GmbH.

Whilst IPRD, non-compete covenants, marketing agreements and distributor relationships were identied, the insignicance of these intangibles to the Stellex business and immaterial values meant no fair values were ascribed or recognised.
Stellex had three trade names, only one of which was deemed to have any measurable value.
The Bandy name is well recognised in its industry, and its value was established using a Relief from Royalty RFR methodology, which values the trade name based on projected cash ows attributable to the trade name, an assumed royalty rate that would be charged if the name were subject to licence within a comparable trade situation and an appropriate discount rate reecting inherent risk in the projected cash ows.
The value determined was less than 1 million but it has been recognised within the Stellex financial returns consolidated in the Groups 2006 Annual Report.
Stellex is a recognised market leader in machining large, complex titanium structures.
Notably the company has a unique blend of five axis exotic metal and aluminium machining, proprietary tooling, assembly, control systems and management expertise.
These capabilities are based on know-how which manifests itself in developed proprietary cutter compensation technology and unique cutter geometry and grinding techniques.
The proprietary technology has been valued using a RFR methodology.
The cash ow forecasts supporting this valuation reect the future sales to be generated in conjunction with the technology.
The fair value attributed to proprietary technology represents the theoretical costs avoided by Stellex from not having to pay a licence fee for the technology.
The royalty rate used in the valuation was 2%, which was based on a review of licence agreements for comparable technologies in similar industrial segments.
An after tax discount rate of 13.5% was applied to the forecast cash ows, a rate that reects the higher inherent risk of intangible cash ows compared to the weighted average cost of capital of the Stellex acquisition.
94 GKN plc Annual Report 2006 The intangible asset inherent in Stellexs contractual position and its customer relationships were both valued using an Excess Earnings Method EEM.
This methodology places a value on the intangible as a function of a managements estimate of the attrition rate on the expected cash ows arising from the contracts and forecast cash ows likely to accrue to Stellex from its customer base: b expected cash ows arising from the intangibles c discount rate reective of the risks inherent in the ows and d an asset charge attributable to operating assets needed to generate the cash ows.
The cash ows attributable to customer relationships include an annual attrition rate of 5% to reect expected decay in future revenues.
An after tax discount rate of 13.5% was applied to the forecast cash ows arising from both categories of intangible.
The valuation of all intangibles also reects the tax benefit of amortisation, which in the context of Stellex has meant a benefit assessed with reference to US tax laws.
According to US tax law an intangible may be rateably amortised over 15 years regardless of its actual useful life, as such there is a tax benefit to an acquirer and hence values attributable to the intangible assets have been recognised.
This value amounts to 5 million across all the intangibles recognised.
The fair value of customer and contractual relationships recognised was 22 million and the fair value of titanium cutter technology and know-how was 4 million.
Fair value adjustments on tangible xed assets represent a net uplift on plant and equipment to fair values following an external third party appraisal.
The uplift primarily represents the restoration of asset values previously written off by Stellex when it was in severe financial difficulty.
Stellex operates from leased facilities where the rentals are reective of current market values and hence no fair value is attributable to Stellexs interest in these leases.
Inventories acquired have been fair valued at current replacement cost for raw materials and selling price, adjusted for costs of disposal and a selling margin, for nished goods and work-in-progress.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Stellex is attributable to the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination with the Groups existing US Aerostructures business, the value of the embedded workforce, the value of a geographically significant player in the US commercial civil titanium aerostructures market and the ownership and control of a leading business in an industry with substantial barriers to entry.
Stellex contributed 21 million to sales and 2 million to the Groups trading profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Stellex had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the period would have increased by 50 million and Group trading profit would have increased by 10 million.

IPRD, non-compete covenants, marketing and distributor agreements and customer contracts were deemed to have no significant or measurable value.
The intangibles recognised and measured were trade names, proprietary technology and customer relationships.
The valuation methodologies described above were also those used in the Rockford assessment.
The trade names recognised relate to the Rockford and Mechanics trade names both of which are well known in the industrial segment within which Rockford operates and are believed to represent a high quality threshold in the industry.
The royalty rate used in the valuation of the Rockford trade name was 1% and 2% in respect of the Mechanics trade name.
The proprietary technology valued represents the value of Rockfords patented technology covering hydro-dynamic and controlled slip clutch technology.
An attributable royalty rate of 4% has been used in the valuation and a discount rate of 14%.
Whilst the existence of formal contracts is minimal within the Rockford business, its long-standing customer relationships have been valued incorporating an attrition rate of 10%, and a discount rate of 14%.
The value of tax amortisation benefit recognised on the Rockford intangibles amounted to 3 million.
Intangible xed assets acquired include the value of the Rockford and Mechanics trade names, 3 million, the value of customer relationships, 12 million and the value of patented proprietary technology, 3 million.
Fair value adjustments on tangible xed assets represent the uplift to fair value on plant and equipment arising from a review of market values and an assessment of the depreciated replacement of cost of the plant and equipment.
Rockford operates from a leased facility where the rentals are reective of current market values hence there is no fair value inherent in the lease.
Other inventory adjustments include the restatement of acquired inventory onto a FIFO basis of valuation.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Rockford is attributable to the value of the embedded workforce and a barrier to entry premium.
Rockford contributed 15 million to sales and 3 million to the Groups trading profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of Rockford had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the period would have increased by 18 million and Group trading profit would have increased by 3 million.
Net cash outow arising on acquisition m Cash consideration and directly attributable costs 29 Cash and cash equivalents acquired 1 28 In the post-acquisition period Rockford Powertrain contributed 2 million to cash generated from operations and absorbed nil million in investing activities.
Other 2006 acquisitions m Provisional fair value of net assets acquired 6 Goodwill arising on acquisition 2 Fair value of consideration including directly attributable costs 8 1 million of the Liuzhou consideration included above is deferred dependent primarily on the nalisation of completion accounts.
The book value of net assets acquired prior to the acquisition amounted to 6 million.
Currently the fair value of intangibles acquired remains under investigation and therefore may be subsumed in the goodwill arising on acquisition currently reported.
The post-acquisition contribution towards Group sales and trading profit of the other 2006 acquisitions was not material.
The estimated impact of these acquisitions on 2006 Group results, if they had been completed on 1 January 2006, would not have been material.
Prior year acquisitions Further fair value adjustments made in 2006 in connection with 2005 acquisitions were not material and hence 2005 comparatives have not been restated.

A number of retirement plans are operated which provide certain employees with post-employment medical benets.
Pensions In the UK, pension arrangements are made through an externally funded dened benefit scheme.
In the USA and the Rest of the World there are a number of externally funded dened benefit schemes, while in certain companies in Europe funds are retained within the business to provide for post-employment obligations.
a Dened benefit schemes measurement and assumptions Independent actuarial valuations of all dened benefit scheme assets and liabilities were carried out at 31 December 2006.
The present value of the dened benefit obligation, the related current service cost and the past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
Annual Report 2006 GKN plc 97 Notes to the financial statements continued 30 Post-employment obligations continued Key assumptions were: UK Americas Europe ROW %%%% 2006 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.1 3.5 2.50 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 3.2 2.0 1.75 n a Discount rate 5.1 5.9 4.70 2.5 Ination assumption 3.1 2.5 1.75 1.0 Rate of increases in medical costs: initial long-term 8.0 4.5 10.0 5.0 n a n a 2005 Rate of increase in pensionable salaries 4.3 3.5 2.5 2.0 Rate of increase in payment and deferred pensions 2.9 2.0 1.5 n a Discount rate 4.75 5.50 4.25 2.25 Ination assumption 2.8 2.5 1.5 1.0 Rate of increases in medical costs: initial long-term 9.5 4.3 10.0 5.0 n a n a The underlying mortality assumptions for the major schemes are as follows: United Kingdom Such is the size and prole of the UK scheme that data in the schemes mortality experience is collected and reviewed annually.
Mortality assumptions are based on PA92 year of birth tables with a three year age adjustment to reect actual scheme experience.
At a recent review, the rate of improvement in longevity was strengthened to a point beyond short cohort.
The key current year mortality assumptions for the scheme are that a male aged 65 lives for a further 18.5 years, whilst a male aged 40 is expected to live a further 20 years after retiring at 65.
The impact of this change in assumptions has increased the scheme deficit by 38 million.
Overseas In the USA, RP-2000 tables scaled to 2006 continued to be used whilst in Germany the RT2005-G tables were again used.
In the USA the longevity assumption for a male aged 65 is that he lives a further 18.1 years whilst in Germany for a further 17.7 years.
The longevity assumption for a USA male currently aged 40 is that he also lives for a further 18.1 years once attaining 65 years, with the German equivalent assumption being 17.7 years.
These assumptions are based solely on the prescribed tables not on actual GKN experience.
Assumption sensitivity analysis The impact of a one percentage point movement in the primary assumptions on the dened benefit net obligations as at 31 December 2006 is set out below: UK Americas Europe ROW m m m m Discount rate 1% 282 36 35 2 Discount rate 1% 382 45 44 2 Rate of ination 1% 276 26 Rate of ination 1% 280 27 Rate of increase in medical costs 1% 2 9 Rate of increase in medical costs 1% 2 7 A one percentage point increase in the assumption on healthcare benets would increase the total service and interest cost by 1 million 2005 1 million and the liability by 11 million 2005 13 million.
A one per cent decrease in the assumption on healthcare benets would reduce the total service and interest cost by nil 2005 1 million and the liability by 9 million 2005 10 million.

The settlement curtailment credit of 1 million arises from further structural change to retiree medical benefit arrangements in the United States whilst the charge of 4 million largely represents the cost of downsizing two UK businesses in the Automotive portfolio.
The prior year 15 million settlement curtailment credit arose from the closure of a Driveline facility in Europe 5 million, the exit from a multi-employer dened benefit scheme in Japan 7 million and the structural changes to retiree medical benefit arrangements in the United States of America 3 million.

In addition a Group subsidiary owed nil 2005 1 million to a joint venture in respect of a short-term nancing facility bearing interest at LIBOR less 0.125% see note 17.
35 Post-balance sheet events In January 2007 the Group announced its intention to completely cease its UK cylinder liner manufacturing operations which constitutes a major proportion of the Groups Other Automotive segment.
This decision will result in job losses in the region of 400 and result in a reported loss for 2007 in the region of 10 million.
When operations cease in 2007, which is forecast, the results of the business will be disclosed and reported separately.
In February 2007 Powder Metallurgy and Driveline announced the final restructuring actions of the Groups strategic restructuring programme.
These announcements will result in the closure of a further North American facility and a headcount reduction in the region of 600 employees.
The 2007 cost of these actions and the remaining charges on the overall programme is estimated at 37 million.
