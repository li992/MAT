The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note 2 above.
The group accounts for inter-segment sales as if the sales were to third parties, that is, at current market prices.
The group evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on this evaluation.
The groups secondary segment reporting format is geographical.
Geographical segments are based on the location of the groups assets.
Sales to external customers disclosed in geographical segments are based on the geographical location of its customers.

Equity-settled transactions On 29 April 2005 the Company introduced a Long Term Incentive Plan LTIP for senior employees including directors.
Under the scheme rules, participatory interests in ordinary shares are granted to eligible employees.
Unless varied by the Trustees of the scheme, 25% of the participatory interests in ordinary shares granted vest on award date with the balance vesting equally over the following three years, provided the recipients remain employees of the group.
The scheme rules also stipulate participatory interests in ordinary shares will vest immediately on the occurrence of certain events, including the admission of the Companys shares to the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange.
In 2005, 53,000 participatory interests in US$1.00 ordinary shares were granted under the LTIP scheme rules.
The fair value of the interests granted, as determined using a net asset based formula, was US$897,000 or US$16.93 per US$1.00 ordinary share.
As a result of the Companys listing on the London Stock Exchange on 7 October 2005, as governed by the LTIP scheme rules, all then unvested awards of participatory interests in ordinary shares vested immediately.
Consequently, the group recognised a total expense of US$897,000 during 2005 in relation to these equitysettled transactions.

The offer to purchase participatory interests in ordinary shares was extended through the Petrofac Limited Executive Share Scheme ESS, which is administered by Petrofac ESOP.
The rules of the ESS, unless varied by the Trustee, required a down-payment on acquisition of participatory interests with the balance structured as an interest bearing shareholder loan note, payable over three years.
Shareholder loan notes bear interest at rates between 3.5% and 3.8% 2005: between 3.4% and 4.5% dependent on the year of issue.
64 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2006 A ordinary shares During 2005, the conditions allowing the Company to call upon 3i Group plc to convert its unsecured variable rate loan notes to equity as A ordinary shares were satisfied.
Under IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, the Company classied the A ordinary shares as a financial liability, as the then Articles of Association of the Company provided the shares with priority of dividends, including the right to an annual 5% xed dividend.
The finance cost of US$556,000 in 2005 reects the 5% dividend accruing on the A ordinary shares between the date of issue on 21 June 2005 and the date the A ordinary shares were reclassied as ordinary shares on listing of the Company on the London Stock Exchange.

12 Goodwill A summary of the movements in goodwill is presented below: 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 At 1 January 49,183 49,653 Acquisitions during the year note 11 668 5,405 Exchange difference 6,881 5,875 At 31 December 56,732 49,183 Goodwill acquired through business combinations has been allocated to three groups of cash-generating units, which are reportable segments, for impairment testing as follows: Facilities Management comprising Petrofac Facilities Management and Plant Asset Management Training comprising Petrofac Training, Chrysalis Learning, Rubicon Response and PPS Process Control & Instrumentation Resources comprising Petrofac Resources International Limited These represent the lowest level within the group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes.
Facilities Management and Training cash-generating units The recoverable amounts for the Facilities Management and Training units have been determined based on value in use calculations, using discounted pre-tax cash ow projections.
Management has adopted a ten year projection period to assess each units value in use as it considers the life of the goodwill for both the Facilities Management and Training cash-generating units to signicantly exceed the five year impairment test period referred to in IAS 36.
The cash ow projections are based on financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five year period, extrapolated, thereafter at a growth rate of 5% per annum.
Management considers this is a conservative long-term growth rate relative to both the economic outlook for the units in their respective markets within the oil & gas industry and the growth rates experienced in the recent past by each unit.
70 Petrofac Annual report and accounts 2006 Resources cash-generating units The recoverable amount of the Resources unit is also determined on a value in use calculation using discounted pre-tax cash ow projections based on financial budgets and economic parameters for the unit approved by senior management and covering a five year period, as recommended under IAS 36.
Carrying amount of goodwill allocated to each group of cash-generating units 2006 2005 US$000 US$000 Facilities Management unit 30,091 26,117 Training unit 24,424 20,849 Resources unit 2,217 2,217 At 31 December 56,732 49,183 Key assumptions used in value in use calculations The calculation of value in use for both the Facilities Management and Training units is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Market share Growth rate Net profit margins Discount rate Market share: The assumption relating to market share for the Facilities Management unit is based on the unit re-securing those existing customer contracts in the UK which are due to expire during the projection period: for the Training unit, the key assumptions relate to managements assessment of maintaining the units market share in the UK and developing further the business in international markets.
Growth rate: estimates are based on managements assessment of market share having regard to macro-economic factors and the growth rates experienced in the recent past by each unit.
A growth rate of 5% per annum has been applied for the remaining five years of the ten year projection period.
Net profit margins: estimates are based on managements assumption of achieving a level of performance at least in line with the recent past performance of each of the units.
Discount rate: management has used a pre-tax discount rate of 8.0% 2005: 9.1% per annum which is derived from the estimated weighted average cost of capital of the group.
This discount rate has been calculated using an estimated risk free rate of return adjusted for the groups estimated equity market risk premium and the groups cost of debt.
The calculation of value in use for the Resources unit is most sensitive to the following assumptions: Financial returns Discount rate Oil prices Financial returns: estimates are based on the unit achieving returns on existing investments comprising both those that are currently cash owing and those which are in development and which may therefore be consuming cash at least in line with current forecast income and cost budgets during the planning period.
Discount rate: management has used an estimate of the pre-tax weighted average cost of capital of the group plus a risk premium to reect the particular risk characteristics of each individual investment.
The discount rates range between 10% and 15% 2005: 9.9% and 17.0%.
Oil prices: management has used a prudent oil price assumption of US$40 per barrel for the impairment testing of its individual oil & gas investments.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions With regard to the assessment of value in use of the cash generating units, management believes that no reasonably possible changes in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the relevant unit to exceed its recoverable amount, after giving due consideration to the macro-economic outlook for the oil & gas industry and the commercial arrangements with customers underpinning the cash ow forecasts for each of the units.

The Company also granted an option to 3i to acquire shares representing 13.0% of the Companys share capital, as so enlarged the Option Shares, subject to adjustment to 20.0% in the event of the 3i variable rate unsecured loan notes remaining unpaid.
On 21 October 2004, this option was amended, providing 3i with a revised right to acquire shares representing 16.2% of the Companys share capital, as so enlarged, subject to adjustment to 23.2% in the event of the 3i variable rate unsecured loan notes remaining unpaid.
The option was exercisable by 3i at any time until 30 June 2009 and by the Company upon the fullment of certain conditions.
During the year, the conditions allowing the Company to call upon 3i to subscribe for the Options Shares were satisfied and, on 21 June 2005, the aggregate subscription amount was satisfied by the cancellation of the loan notes and the issue of 1,397,557 A ordinary shares to 3i.
In addition, and as part of the consideration for the Option Shares, the one B ordinary share held by 3i was converted to a deferred ordinary share Class B.
This deferred ordinary share had no right to receive notice of general meetings of the Company or rights to attend or vote at general meetings and on 7 October 2005 was redeemed at its nominal value.

22 Treasury shares During the year, the Company acquired 1,460,135 of its own shares at a cost of US$8,127,000 for the purpose of making awards under its employee share schemes and these shares are held by the Petrofac Employee benefit Trust and classied for balance sheet purposes as treasury shares within equity.
23 Share-based payment plans On 13 September 2005, the Company established three share schemes for the benefit of employees of the group, being a Performance Share Plan, a Deferred Bonus Share Plan and an approved Share Incentive Plan.
A further share scheme, the Restricted Share Plan, was established during the year.
All of these share schemes are equity settled award schemes.
These share schemes are described below.
Further details of the schemes can be found in the directors remuneration report on pages 41 to 42.
Performance Share Plan PSP Under the Performance Share Plan of the Company, share awards are granted to executive directors and a restricted number of other senior executives of the group.
The shares cliff vest at the end of three years subject to continued employment from the date of the award and on achieving certain pre-dened non-market and market based performance conditions.
The non-market based condition, representing 50% of the total Performance Share Plan, is subject to achieving between 15% and 25% earnings per share EPS growth targets over a three year period.
The fair value of the equity-settled award relating to the EPS part of the scheme was estimated based on the quoted closing market price of 353p per Company share at the date of grant with an assumed vesting rate of 97% per annum subsequently trued up for the year ending 31 December 2006 to 100% based on the actual leaver rate during the period from award date to year end over the three year vesting period of the plan.
The remaining 50% market performance based part of these awards is dependent on the total shareholder return TSR of the group compared to an index composed of selected relevant companies.
The shares vesting under this portion of the award were fair valued at 234p per share by an independent valuer using a Monte Carlo simulation model taking into account the terms and conditions of the plan rules and using the following assumptions at the date of grant: Expected share price volatility 28.0% based on median of comparator groups three year volatilities Share price correlation with comparator group 10.0% Risk-free interest rate 4.6% Expected life of share award three years The number of ordinary shares awarded in the year in relation to PSP was 431,194 and all of these awards were still outstanding but not exercisable at 31 December 2006.
The charge recognised in the current year amounted to US$536,000.
Deferred Bonus Share Plan DBSP Executive directors and selected employees are eligible to participate under this scheme.
Participants may be invited to elect or in some cases, be required, to receive a proportion of any bonus in ordinary shares of the Company Invested Awards.
Following such award, the Company will generally grant the participant an additional award over a number of shares bearing a specified ratio to the number of his or her invested shares Matching Shares.
The awards vest over a period of three years from the grant date provided that the participant does not leave the groups employment, subject to a limited number of exceptions.
The invested awards are fully recognised as an expense in the period to which the bonuses relate.
At the year end the values of the bonuses settled by shares cannot be determined until all employees have confirmed the voluntary portion of their bonus they wish to be settled by shares rather than cash and until the Remuneration Committee has approved the mandatory portion of the employee bonuses to be settled in shares.
Once the voluntary and mandatory portions of the bonus to be settled in shares is determined, the final bonus liability to be settled in shares is transferred to the reserve for share-based payments.
The costs relating to the matching shares are recognised over the three year vesting period.
The fair value of the equity-settled matching shares granted during the year in respect of the plan was estimated based on the quoted closing market price of 353p per Company share at the date of grant with an assumed vesting rate of 97% per annum subsequently trued up at 31 December 2006 to 93% based on the actual leaver rate during the period from award date to year end over the three year vesting period of the plan.
During the year 597,167 shares as invested awards and 548,214 matching shares were granted to the participants in the scheme and 1,104,503 of these share awards were outstanding but not exercisable at 31 December 2006.
The charge recognised in the year in relation to matching share awards amounted to US$666,000.
Share Incentive Plan SIP All UK employees, including UK resident directors, are eligible to participate in the scheme.
Employees may invest up to GBP1,500 per tax year of gross salary or, if less, 10% of salary to purchase ordinary shares in the Company.
There is no holding period for these shares.
