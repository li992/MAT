Employer Black-Scholes model, depending upon the characteristics of the scheme concerned.
contributions and bene t payments in 2007 are expected to be 50.0 million.
The assumptions underlying the Black-Scholes model are detailed in note 27, including details of assumed dividend yields.
Market price on any given day is obtained from external, publicly available sources.
Market Non-market conditions Most share-based plans are subject to non-market performance conditions, such as margin or growth targets, as well as continued employment.
The Renewed LEAP scheme is subject to a number of performance conditions, including TSR, a marketbased condition.
For schemes without market-based performance conditions, the valuation methodology above is applied and, at each year end, the relevant accrual for each grant is revised, if appropriate, to take account of any changes in estimate of the likely number of shares expected to vest.
For schemes with market-based performance conditions, the probability of satisfying these conditions is assessed at grant date through a statistical model such as the Monte Carlo Model and applied to the fair value.
This initial valuation remains xed throughout the life of the relevant plan, irrespective of the actual outcome in terms of performance.
Where a lapse occurs due to cessation of employment, the cumulative charge taken to date is reversed.
