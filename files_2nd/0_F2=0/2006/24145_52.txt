The fair value of shares and other variable yield securities and of derivative financial instruments, are estimated using pricing models or discounted cash flow techniques.
Where pricing models are used, inputs are based on market related data at the balance sheet date.

For units in unit trusts and shares in open-ended investment companies, fair value is by reference to published bid-values.

The total amount of the change in fair value of investments estimated using a valuation technique that is recognised in the income statement during the year is a charge of 98m 2005: credit of 143m.
