Under current tax legislation, unrelieved tax losses and deductible temporary differences may be carried forward for relief against future tax liabilities.
Deferred tax assets have not been recognised in respect of the following items: Group Group 2006 2005 m m Deductible temporary differences 13.0 13.2 Tax losses 6.3 11.6 19.3 24.8 The probability of any realisation of unrelieved tax losses is, in all cases, based on the groups prudent assessment of the future profitability of the company concerned, supported by revenue and cost budgets approved by the groups directors, and is reviewed on an ongoing basis.
The group has not recognised a deferred tax liability for the withholding tax and other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the earnings are continually reinvested, and as a result no tax is expected to be paid in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted tax of 1.1m at 25 February 2006 2005: 0.9m would be payable.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Risk exposures Exposure to debt market prices, credit, interest rate, exchange and liquidity risks arises in the normal course of the groups business.
The board approves treasury policies, with members of the senior management team directly controlling day-to-day operations.
The group uses derivatives only to manage its foreign exchange risks arising from underlying business activities.
No transactions of a speculative nature are undertaken.
Debt market prices The group has no significant risk to debt market prices.
Credit risk The group has no significant concentrations of credit risk.
It has policies in place to ensure that wholesale sales of products are made to customers with an appropriate credit history.
Sales to retail customers are made in cash or via major credit cards.
Derivative counterparties and cash transactions are limited to high-credit-quality financial institutions.
The group has policies that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution.
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk The groups interest-rate risk arises from borrowings.
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the group to cash flow interest-rate risk.
Borrowings at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest-rate risk.
The groups objective is to minimise the cost of borrowing by matching the maturity dates of loans to the seasonal requirements of the business.
Interest payable on borrowings other than finance leases is fixed for periods of up to six months, as set out in note 21.
Foreign exchange risk The group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily with respect to the Euro, the US dollar, the Singapore dollar and the Hong Kong dollar.
Foreign exchange risk arises from future commercial transactions, recognised assets and liabilities and net investments in foreign operations.
The group hedges the effects of changes in exchange rates either on balances payable to its subsidiaries that is not expected to be settled in the foreseeable future or on balances receivable from its subsidiaries that may or may not be capitalised in the foreseeable future.
In addition, to manage the foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions and recognised assets and liabilities, the group manages the position in each foreign currency by using external forward currency contracts, which are designated as hedges of foreign exchange risk on specific assets, liabilities or future transactions on a gross basis.
The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 71 Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 25.
FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED The groups currency risk management policy is to hedge on a monthly basis to cover receipts and payments expected to occur in nine months time using basic forward exchange contracts only.
Each hedging instrument is designated as such and is documented in accordance with the requirements of IAS 39:88.
The hedging instruments do not hedge all gross receipts.
The fair value of hedging contracts held to hedge foreign exchange risk at the balance sheet date is 0.1m 2005 0.2m.
The group has certain investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation risk.
Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the groups foreign operations is managed primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies.
Liquidity risk The groups objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding through medium term facilities and flexibility through short term local overdrafts.
The main facility is an 130.0 million multi-currency revolving credit agreement which runs until December 2009.
In addition, there are a number of smaller short term facilities to support local requirements, including overdraft facilities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.
Total available facilities at 25 February 2006 were 134.7 m 2005 130.0 m, of which 50.8 m 2005 40.3m was drawn down.
Fair value estimation The following summarises the methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments.
Derivatives Forward exchange contracts are generally valued by deducting the current spot rate from the contractual forward price.
Where significant the discounted contractual forward price is used, based on market discount rates for a similar instrument at the balance sheet date.
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings Fair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest case flows.
Finance lease liabilities The fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements.
The estimated fair values reflect change in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables payables For receivables and payables with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect their fair value.
All other receivables and payables are discounted to determine the fair value.
EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity shareholders of the company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding ordinary shares purchased by the company and held as employee share option trust shares Note 17.
2006 2005 m m Profit attributable to equity shareholders of the company 28.6 28.5 Number in millions Number in millions Weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 210.5 206.6 Basic earnings per share pence per share 13.6 13.8 Diluted Diluted earnings per share is calculated adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Dilutive potential ordinary shares arise from share options.
For these, a calculation is done to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options.
The number of shares calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS Notes to the reconciliation of equity a Reconciliations and explanatory notes on how the transition to IFRS has effected profit and net assets previously reported under UK generally accepted accounting principles are given below: IFRS 3 Business Combinations As at the transition date, amortisation of goodwill on a straight-line basis ceased and accumulated amortisation and impairment losses recognised to that date were netted against the goodwills original cost.
From the date of transition, goodwill is tested annually for impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill balances were reviewed for impairment as at 28 February 2004 and 26 February 2005 and no adjustments were identified.
In the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005 the non-amortisation of goodwill has resulted in an increase in profit before tax of 3.8 million.
There was no resulting tax impact.
IAS 21 Foreign Exchange Under IAS 21, exchange differences resulting from the translation of the opening net investment in foreign operations that arise after the transition date are recognised as a separate component of equity, rather than within retained earnings as under UK GAAP.
In addition, when a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences accumulated since the transition date are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Under UK GAAP such exchange differences are not re-cycled from retained earnings through the profit and loss account on the disposal of a foreign operation.
For the parent company accounts net investment hedging is not allowed under IFRS.
Therefore investments have been restated to historical cost and the foreign exchange on retranslation of foreign currency loans has been taken to the income statement.
IAS 17 Leased Assets Under IAS 17, lease agreements for land and buildings are treated as finance leases where the lease term approximates to the useful life of the building and where the present value of the minimum lease payments, excluding payments for land, approximates to the fair value of the leased assets at inception.
Following a review of the groups building leases, a number of leases have been reclassified from operating to finance leases and have been brought on to the balance sheet.
This has led to an increase of 9.4 million in fixed assets as at 26 February 2005, with a corresponding increase in finance lease liabilities.
The main impact to the income statement is that operating lease rentals under UK GAAP has been replaced by depreciation and an interest expense under IFRS.
Over the period of the lease, the total impact on the income statement has been the same.
However, under IFRS more of the total expense has been recognised earlier in the term of the lease and the majority of the expense has been classified under finance costs rather than operating costs.
The pre-tax impact on the income statement for the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005 is not material, although there is a 1.7 million reclassification of cost from operating profit to interest expense as a result of this change in accounting policy.
IAS 38 Intangible Assets Under UK GAAP, items such as software development and website development costs are included within tangible fixed assets.
IAS 38 requires these assets to be disclosed under intangible assets.
Consequently, a reclassification has been performed on the restatement of the groups balance sheet to IFRS.
The amount reclassified as at 26 February 2005 is 9.8 million.
There is no impact on the income statement as a result of this reclassification.
IAS 32 and 39 Financial Instruments Under IAS 32 a liability has been recognised in respect of the option for the owners of the minority interest in Mighty Ocean Limited to sell their 25% interest in Mighty Ocean Limited to the group.
IAS 39 has a number of implications on the restatement of the groups financial statements: Deferred consideration receivable Under UK GAAP, deferred consideration is recorded at the gross amount due.
Under IAS 39, such receivables are recorded at their discounted value, with the difference being recorded as interest receivable over the period that the consideration is due.
As at 26 February 2005, this adjustment has resulted in a reduction in receivables due after more than one year of 0.7 million.
The effect on the income statement for the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005 is an increase in pre-tax profit of 0.2 million.
Hedging instruments Under UK GAAP, gains and losses on hedges on long-term amounts due from or to foreign subsidiaries are taken to the profit and loss account.
In addition, gains and losses on hedges of future transactions denominated in foreign currency are deferred until the period in which the hedged transaction occurs, at which point they are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Under IFRS, gains and losses on hedges of future transactions are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity to the extent that the hedges are deemed to be effective in the group and company accounts: the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement.
This applies from 1 January 2005 for hedges of future transactions denominated in currency, as prior to this date the group did not meet the criteria for hedge accounting under IAS 39, and at 26 February 2005 this resulted in a reduction in pre-tax profit of 1.1 million.
76 The Body Shop International PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2006 30.
FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS CONTINUED IFRS 2 Share Based Payments The main impact on the group of IFRS 2 is an expense charge to the income statement in respect of employee and directors share options.
Under UK GAAP, there is no comparable charge.
The expense is calculated based on the fair value of the share options at the date of grant and is spread over the vesting period of the option scheme, adjusted for expected levels of vesting.
The Black-Scholes model has been used to calculate the fair value of the share options at the date of grant.
To improve comparability, the group has applied IFRS 2 to all share options that had not vested as at 29 February 2004, rather than just to those granted post 1 November 2002 as permitted by the standard.
The fair value of share options granted prior to 1 November 2002 was published on the groups website on 15 August 2005.
For the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005, the impact of IFRS 2 was a 1.4 million reduction in pre-tax profit.
This is offset by a deferred tax credit of 0.2 million.
The total deferred tax credit is based on the difference between the market value of the share options at the balance sheet date and the option exercise price.
Of this amount, the deferred tax relating to the difference between the share option charge and the BlackScholes charge is taken to the income statement, with the remainder being credited directly to equity.
As at 26 February 2005, the total amount recognised with respect to deferred tax on share options was 4.1 million.
IAS 12 Income Taxes Current taxes are accounted for under IFRS under the same basis as UK GAAP.
Deferred tax under UK GAAP is recognised on all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date.
The exception is the recognition of deferred tax assets, which is limited to the extent that the group anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb the reversal of the underlying timing differences.
Under IFRS, deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from the differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and their corresponding tax basis.
Deferred tax is not recognised on temporary differences arising from goodwill or from the initial recognition other than in a business combination of other assets and liabilities in a transaction where there is no effect on either the tax or accounting profit.
The change to the balance sheet liability method of accounting for deferred tax results in the following changes to the tax charge: 29 Feb 04 26 Feb 05 26 Feb 05 26 Feb 05 Net assets P&L Reserves Net assets m m m m Impact of IAS 12 0.2 0.2 Tax effect of accounting changes 2.6 0.5 3.0 6.1 Total tax impact 2.8 0.3 3.0 6.1 The most significant elements of the change in the tax charge as a result of the transition to IFRS relates to the recognition of deferred tax on sharebased payments and on hedging gains or losses under IAS 39.
IAS 10 Dividends Under UK GAAP, dividends were recognised in the profit and loss account in the period to which they relate.
Under IFRS, dividends are only recognised in the period to which they relate if they have been approved prior to year end.
If they are not approved until after the balance sheet date, they are recognised in the following accounting period.
As a result the final dividend for the 52 weeks ended 28 February 2004 of 7.7 million, which was not declared until after the balance sheet date, has been reversed in the transition balance sheet and charged to equity in the balance sheet as at 26 February 2005.
Similarly, the final dividend for the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005 of 7.9 million has been charged to equity in the 52 weeks to 25 February 2006.
IAS 37 Provisions Previously, provisions in the balance sheet were not discounted.
Under IFRS, provisions are carried at a discounted value that reflects an appropriate pre-tax discount rate applied to expected future cash flows.
Other Adjustments Other adjustments include the recognition of a vacation accrual under IAS 19, the impact of which was not material on either the transition balance sheet or the 52 weeks to 26 February 2005.

FIRST TIME ADOPTION OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS IFRS CONTINUED g In summary, the impact of adopting IFRS on the accounts for the 52 weeks ended 26 February 2005 is as follows: Impact on income statement m Profit as per UK GAAP 27.3 Goodwill amortisation 3.8 Share-based payments 1.4 Financial instruments 0.9 Leases 0.1 Other 0.2 Increase in profit before tax 1.2 Taxation 0.3 Increase in profit after tax 1.5 Profit as per IFRS 28.8 Impact on net assets m Dividends 7.9 Taxation 6.1 Goodwill amortisation 3.8 Leases 5.7 Financial instruments 6.1 Increase in net assets 6.0 Impact on cash flow Under IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements, the definition of cash is extended to cash and cash equivalents which includes movements on short term deposits.
The presentation of the cash flow statement has therefore changed to include these cash equivalents.
Other than this disclosure change, there is no impact on reported cash flows as a result of the transition to IFRS.
