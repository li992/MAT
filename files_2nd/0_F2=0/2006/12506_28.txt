80 Premier Foods plc Annual Report and Accounts 2006 Notes to the financial statements continued Diluted earnings per share Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.
The only dilutive potential ordinary shares of the Company are savings related share options.
A calculation is performed to determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value determined as the average annual market share price of the Companys shares based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to the outstanding share options.
There was an issue of 247,848,157 ordinary shares on 14 August as part of a rights issue fully paid on 8 September 2006.
These have been included in determining the weighted average for the current year.
The number of shares used to calculate ordinary earnings per share is compared below with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.
No adjustment is made to earnings in calculating diluted earnings per share.
