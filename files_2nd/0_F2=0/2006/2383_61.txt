44 Share-based payments continued The group used a Monte Carlo simulation to fair value the TSR element of the 2006 and 2005 MTPP and EDIP plans.
In accordance with the rules of the plans the model simulates BPs TSR and compares it against our principal strategic competitors over the three-year period of the plans.
The model takes into account the historic dividends, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the TSR element.
In accordance with the rules of the plan, the model simulates BPs SHRAM and compares it with the comparator companies all companies in the FTSE All World Oil & Gas Index over the three-year period of the plan.
The SHRAMs of the comparator companies have been determined from market data over the preceding three-year period.
The model takes into account the historic dividend yields, share price volatilities and covariances of BP and each comparator company to produce a predicted distribution of relative share performance.
This is applied to the reward criteria to give an expected value of the SHRAM element.
Accounting expense does not necessarily represent the actual value of share-based payments made to recipients which are determined by the Remuneration Committee according to established criteria.
