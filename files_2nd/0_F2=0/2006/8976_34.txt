r FINANCIAL INSTRuMENTS i Recognition The Group recognises financial assets and liabilities on its balance sheet when, and only when, it becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
ii Measurement When financial assets and liabilities are initially recognised, they are measured at fair value being the consideration given or received plus, in the case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Any gain or loss at initial recognition is recognised in the current periods income statement.
In determining estimated fair value, investments are valued at quoted bid prices.
When quoted prices on an active market are not available, fair value is determined by reference to price quotations for similar instruments traded.
The Group classifies investments depending upon the intent of management at the time of the purchase.
Investments with fixed maturities and fixed or determinable payments that management has both the positive intent, and the ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity.
Assets held for trading are financial assets held for short term trading purposes, and are measured at fair value through profit or loss.
Loans and receivables are loans and receivables created by the Group providing money to a debtor.
Loans and receivables comprise loans and advances other than purchased loans.
Held-to-maturity investments and originated loans and receivables are initially recognised in accordance with the policy stated above and subsequently re-measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Allowance for impairment is estimated on a case-by-case basis.
Commodity futures are initially recognised at fair value.
Any gains and losses arising from changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement in the period in which they occur.
iii Derecognition A financial asset is derecognised when the Group loses control over the contractual rights that comprise that asset.
This occurs when the rights are realised, expire or are surrendered.
A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished.
Held-to-maturity instruments and originated loans and receivables are derecognised on the date they are transferred by the Group.
4. segmeNt iNfOrmatiON A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products or services in a particular business sector business segment, or in providing products or services within a particular economic environment geographical segment, which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those of other segments.
Segment information is presented in respect of the Groups primary basis of segmentation in business segments, which are based on the Groups management and internal reporting structures.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis.
Unallocated items comprise corporate head office assets and liabilities, borrowings, income taxes payable, deferred taxes and dividends payable receivable.
The Groups principal operations are based in Kazakhstan, with MKM, a subsidiary of Kazakhmys LLC, being based in Germany.
The Groups activities principally relate to: Kazakh mining operations which involve the production and sale of: Copper cathodes and copper rod Zinc metal and zinc metal in concentrate Gold and silver Other by-product metals lead, rhenium and selenium.
F I N A N C I A L S TAT E M E N T S K A Z AK HM YS PLC 89 ANNUAL REPORT 2 0 0 6 4. segmeNt iNfOrmatiON continued Segmental information is also provided in respect of revenues, by destination and by product.
Segmental information relating to employees is provided in note 8. a buSINESS SEGMENTS The Kazakh Mining business, which involves the processing and sale of copper and other metals, is managed as one business segment.
The products are subject to the same risks and returns, exhibit similar long-term financial performance and are sold through the same distribution channels.
The Group processes substantially all the copper ore it produces and utilises most of the copper concentrate it processes.
The Group has a number of activities that exist solely to support the mining operations including power generation, coal mining and transportation.
These other activities generate less than 10% of total revenues both external and internal and the related assets are less than 10% of total assets.
The UK operation consists of two functions: A trading function responsible for the purchases of products from the Kazakh Mining operations, application of an appropriate mark-up and then onward sale to third parties.
For the purposes of business segmental reporting, the trading function is regarded as a sales function on behalf of the Kazakh Mining business and consequently the assets and liabilities related to those trading operations, i. e. trade creditors and trade receivables, are included within the Kazakh Mining business segment.
The expenses, assets and liabilities of the corporate head office function are disclosed separately as unallocated items.
The price at which sales are made to the Company by Kazakhmys LLC is based on the prevailing price of commodities as determined by the LME.
At the end of 2004, the Group acquired MKM which operates in Germany, where it manufactures copper and copper alloy semifinished products.
MKM faces different risks to the Groups Kazakh Mining business and, therefore, from 1 January 2005 the Group has operated two distinct business segments.
Segmental information in respect of these two business segments for the years ended 31 December 2006 and 2005 is presented below.
