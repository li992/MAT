Notes to the Summary Financial Statement continued 3 Impairment losses The carrying value of goodwill of the Groups mobile operations in Germany, Italy and Sweden was impaired in the year ended 31 March 2006 by 19,400 million, 3,600 million and 515 million respectively due to the Group having revised its view of medium to longer term prospects for these businesses given certain developments in the current market environment.
The German market has seen recent intensification in price competition, principally from new market entrants, together with high levels of penetration and continued regulated reductions in incoming call rates.
In Italy, competitive pressures are increasing with the mobile network operators competing aggressively on subsidies and, increasingly, on price.
The impairment of the carrying value of goodwill in relation to Vodafone Sweden of 515 million in the year to 31 March 2006 2005: 475 million resulted from fierce competition in the Swedish market combined with onerous 3G licence obligations.
On 5 January 2006, the Group completed the sale of its 100% interest in Vodafone Sweden for net cash proceeds, after assumption of net debt by the purchaser, of 953 million 653 million.
