4 Segment information The Group is managed in six reporting segments, differentiated by business: primarily by the nature of products manufactured in each, together with a segment for discontinued operations.
Discontinued includes Uniqema, which was divested in September 2006 and Quest, the disposal of which was announced in November 2006.
An explanation of the basis on which operations are classified as discontinued is set out in note 1.
During the year, the Group changed its reporting segments.
The National Starch business, previously reported as one segment, is now reported as four segments: Adhesives, Specialty Starches, Specialty Polymers and Electronic Materials.
This change reflects a move to global business units during 2006.
Information is also provided for the entirety of the National Starch business as it is an important part of the organisation.
Current and prior year segment information has been updated for the change.
The major products of each business segment are as follows: Business segments Products Continuing operations Paints decorative paint and packaging coatings for food and beverage cans Adhesives industrial adhesives, including waterborne, hot melt and pressure sensitive adhesives and process lubricants Specialty Starches specialty food and industrial starches Specialty Polymers redispersible powder polymers, rheology modifiers and other specialty polymers for water treatment and personal care Electronic Materials adhesives, encapsulants and specialty coatings Regional and Industrial polyester staple fibre, pure terephthalic acid, soda ash, seeds, pharmaceuticals, sulphur-related products and wine chemicals Discontinued operations Quest flavours, fragrance products and fragrance ingredients Uniqema oleochemicals process intermediates, polymers, base stocks and additives for lubricants, personal care, performance specialties for the manufacture of agrochemicals and coatings, oilfield chemicals, textile auxiliaries, spin finish, polymer additives and specialty cleaning Disposal announced in November 2006.
