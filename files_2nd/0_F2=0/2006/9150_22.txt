A tax credit of 68.8m has been recognised in the income statement relating to exceptional items, of which 40.1m is credited against the current year tax charge in relation to the 215.4m net exceptional charge, with the remaining 28.7m credited in respect of prior periods, relating to tax previously provided on exceptional items which is no longer required.
Kingfisher paid 137.5m 98.5m tax to the French tax authorities in the year ended 31 January 2004 as a consequence of the Kesa Electricals demerger and recorded this as an exceptional tax charge.
Proceedings for the recovery of this tax have been initiated and although this may take several years to be resolved, Kingfisher believes that the risk of ultimately being liable for this amount is low.
No asset has been recognised in these accounts as the recovery of this amount is not sufficiently certain at this time.
In certain circumstances, it is possible that the conditions of the UK and French tax clearances for the demerger of Kesa Electricals in the year to 31 January 2004 could be breached.
Whilst the consequences of such a breach could be significant, the Group actively monitors compliance with these conditions and believes that the likelihood of any breach is remote.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximate their fair value.
In addition, concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited, due to the Groups customer base being large and unrelated, and therefore no further credit risk provision is required in excess of the normal provision for doubtful receivables.
The Directors consider that the fair value of non-current trade and other receivables approximates the value at which they are shown above.

Consequently there is also an increase in overdraft balances note 21.
Of the total deposits listed above, there are cash deposits of 22.8m 2005: 67.5m, comprising money market deposits, attracting interest rates based on LIBOR or equivalent market rates, fixed for periods of up to three months.
The carrying amounts of these assets approximate to their fair values.
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise the following at 28 January 2006: millions 2006 2005 Cash at bank and in hand 211.3 94.6 Short-term deposits 22.8 67.5 Bank overdrafts note 21 120.4 56.2 113.7 105.9 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 67 21 Borrowings and other financial liabilities millions 2006 2005 Current Bank loans 222.7 124.1 Bank overdrafts 120.4 56.2 Obligations under finance leases 3.7 4.6 346.8 184.9 Non-current Bank loans 63.5 9.4 Medium Term Notes 1,123.8 738.9 Obligations under finance leases 68.2 70.0 1,255.5 818.3 Total borrowings 1,602.3 1,003.2 Bank loans and overdrafts Current bank loans mature within the next 12 months and overdrafts are repayable on demand.
Both bank loans and overdrafts are arranged at floating rates of interest and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Non-current bank loans consist of a 50m term loan maturing in February 2009, which bears an interest rate based on LIBOR fixed for periods up to six months.
The remaining bank loans are arranged at fixed rates of interest which have an average maturity of two years and an Effective Interest Rate of 5.0%.
The fixed rate loans expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
Within borrowings, an amount of nil 2005: nil is secured over property, stock and other assets.

Medium Term Notes which have been swapped to floating interest rates are repriced on a quarterly basis.
The Group issued a 550m MTN during the year 2005: nil.
No MTNs were repaid during the year 2005: nil.
Finance lease commitments The Group leases certain of its buildings and fixtures and equipment under finance leases.
The average lease term maturity for buildings is 18 years and for fixtures and equipment is three years.
Building leases include a clause to enable upward revision of the rental charge to prevailing market conditions.
The Group has finance leases for various items of property, plant and equipment.
Future minimum lease payments under finance leases, together with the present value of minimum lease payments, are as follows: 2006 2005 Present value Minimum Present value Minimum millions of payments payments of payments payments Within one year 3.7 9.0 4.6 9.4 After one year but not more than five years 23.9 49.2 22.2 42.4 Over five years 44.3 71.3 47.8 82.0 Total minimum lease payments 71.9 129.5 74.6 133.8 Less amounts representing finance charges 57.6 59.2 Present value of minimum lease payments 71.9 74.6 The interest rate inherent in the finance leases is fixed at the contract date for all of the lease term and therefore exposes the Group to fair value interest rate risk.
The Effective Interest Rate on the Groups finance leases is 8.7%.
68 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 21 Borrowings and other financial liabilities continued Fair value of borrowings The Directors estimate the fair value of the Groups current bank loans and overdrafts and obligations under finance leases approximate to their carrying value.
Where available, market values have been used to determine the fair value of non-current borrowings.
Where market values are not available, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest and exchange rates.

This facility is available to be drawn to support the general corporate purposes of the Group including working capital requirements.
Since the year end, Kingfisher has entered into a new committed bank revolving credit facility totalling 300m.
This facility matures in March 2007, but Kingfisher has an option to extend it for a further 12 months.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 69 24 Derivative financial instruments The Group uses interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives to hedge the risk arising from raising finance, the purchase of inventory in foreign currency and net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
Fair value of derivative financial instruments The fair value of derivative financial instruments is calculated by discounting the future cash flows arising from the instrument using market rates.
At the balance sheet date the fair values were: 2006 millions Assets Liabilities Current a Cash flow hedges 2.6 0.5 b Non-designated hedges 0.1 3.8 Total current derivative financial instruments 2.7 4.3 Non-current c Net investment hedges 4.7 1.8 d Fair value hedges 27.2 3.8 Total non-current derivative financial instruments 31.9 5.6 Total derivative financial instruments 34.6 9.9 1 Foreign currency cash flow risk arises from the purchase of inventory in foreign currencies.
This risk is hedged using forward foreign exchange contracts to match committed and a proportion of forecast inventory purchases arising in the next 12 months.
At 28 January 2006 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 128.0m and the net fair value gains and losses on open forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge the foreign currency risk of anticipated future purchases i. e. cash flow hedges will be transferred to the income statement when the inventory is sold within the next 12 months, based on average stock turn.
Amounts of 3.2m and 2.7 m have been transferred to the income statement and inventories respectively, for contracts which matured during the period see note 30.
2 The Group has entered into certain derivatives to provide a hedge of fluctuations in the income statement arising from balance sheet positions.
At 28 January 2006 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 412.4m.
These have not been hedge accounted, since the fair value movements of the derivative in the income statement offset the retranslation of the balance sheet position.
These include a forward foreign exchange contract hedging part of the funding of the Groups overseas operations and a cross-currency foreign exchange swap converting a euro-denominated debt into a Sterling liability.
3 The Group has entered into forward foreign exchange contracts and cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge part of the currency exposure arising from its overseas investments.
At 28 January 2006 the Sterling equivalent notional amount of such contracts was 308.5m.
4 The Group is exposed to interest rate risk.
Interest rate swap contracts have been transacted which convert fixed rate debt issued under the Groups MTN programme to a floating rate liability see note 21.
The UK GAAP fair value comparative information is provided in note 21.
The Group has reviewed all contracts for embedded derivatives which are required to be accounted for separately if they do not meet certain criteria.
The Group does not have any embedded derivatives which are not closely related to the host contract and therefore there is no requirement to bring them on to the balance sheet at fair value.
UK GAAP comparatives In accordance with IFRS 1 paragraph 36A, the Group has deferred the implementation of the standards IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement until the financial year ended 28 January 2006.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of 4.5m 2005: 3.3m of such losses.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining 74.6m 2005: 35.9m due to the unpredictability of future profit streams.
Included in unrecognised tax losses are tax losses arising in China and South Korea of 53.2m 2005: 16.1m which can only be carried forward in the next one to five years and tax losses arising in Spain of 13.2m 2005: 11.1m which can only be carried forward for up to 15 years.
Other losses may be carried forward indefinitely.
No deferred tax is recognised on the unremitted earnings of overseas subsidiaries and joint ventures.
As the earnings are continually reinvested by the Group, no tax is expected to be payable on them in the foreseeable future.
If the earnings were remitted, tax of 36.6m 2005: 369.5m would be payable.
The closing deferred tax balance of 204.4m includes liabilities of 6.0m 2005: 4.2m and assets of 40.1m 2005: 59.4m expected to reverse within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 73 27 Post employment benefits The Group operates a variety of post employment benefit arrangements covering both funded and unfunded defined benefit schemes and funded defined contribution schemes.
The most significant are the funded, final salary defined benefit and defined contribution schemes for the Groups UK employees, however various defined benefit and defined contribution schemes are operated in France, Poland, Italy, China and South Korea.
In France and Poland, they are retirement indemnity in nature, and in South Korea and Italy termination indemnity in nature.
Defined contribution schemes Pension costs for defined contributions schemes, at rates specified in the individual plans rules, are as follows: millions 2006 2005 Defined contribution schemes note 8 3.7 2.1 Defined benefit schemes Balance sheet obligations: millions 2006 2005 Defined benefit liabilities 239.6 325.7 The amount of the defined benefit obligation at 28 January 2006 which relates to funded defined benefit schemes is 232.0m 2005: 320.0m.
Income statement charge: millions 2006 2005 Pension benefits charged to operating profit note 8 36.9 38.0 Net finance cost note 6 3.8 5.1 40.7 43.1 The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried out at 28 January 2006.
The principal actuarial assumptions and expected rates of return used were as follows: 2006 2005 UK Other UK Other Annual % rate %%%% Discount rate 4.7 4.0 to 6.0 5.3 4.2 to 5.5 Salary escalation 4.3 2.0 to 6.7 4.3 2.0 to 6.7 Rate of pension increases 2.7 n a 2.7 n a Price inflation 2.7 2.0 to 2.5 2.7 2.0 to 2.5 2006 2005 UK Other UK Other % rate of return %%%% Equities 7.6 7.8 Bonds 4.2 4.7 Property 5.9 6.2 Other 3.7 4.0 3.7 4.0 Overall expected rate of return 6.1 4.0 6.6 4.0 The overall expected rate of return is effectively a weighted average of the individual asset categories and their inherent expected rates of return.
The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, i. e. the excess of the discount rate over the rate of inflation.
If this assumption increased decreased by 0.1%, the UK defined benefit obligation would decrease increase by approximately 30m, and the annual UK current service cost would decrease increase by approximately 1.4m.
The assumptions for pensioner longevity are based on an analysis of pensioner death trends under the scheme over the period from 1998 to 2004, together with allowances for future improvements to death rates for all members.
The specific tables used are the same as those used in the 2004 funding valuation, namely PMA92C2010 for male pensioners, PFA92C2010 2 year age rating for female pensioners.
Further allowances for improving longevity are included for members yet to retire.
Based on observed trends, the assumed average age at death for current pensioners reaching age 60 is 81.2 for a male and 83.3 for a female.
When members who are yet to retire reach age 60, our assumed average age at death is 84.4 for a male and 85.8 for a female.
These assumptions will be reviewed following the next funding valuation due no later than as at 31 March 2007.

The provision is based on the value of future cash outflows relating to rent, rates and service charges.
This excludes idle properties related to the B&Q UK restructuring programme which are included in the B&Q restructuring provision.
The B&Q restructuring provision represents the estimated cost of the B&Q UK store and head office restructuring programme and the termination of the B&Q UK financial services arrangement as detailed further in note 5.
This provision has been discounted to reflect the time value of money and the risks associated with the specific liabilities.
The provision is expected to be utilised over the next two to three years.
The ultimate costs and timing of cash flows are dependent on exiting the property lease contracts on the closed stores and sub-dividing and sub-letting the surplus space released from those stores to be downsized.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 77 31 Share-based payments All grants of options are made by the Remuneration Committee, which consists solely of Non-Executive Directors.
The Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes have been replaced by the Kingfisher Incentive Scheme.
The first grant of options under the Kingfisher Incentive Scheme was made in April 2004.
A full description of the Scheme and its operation is provided on pages 37 to 39 of the Remuneration report.
The last grant of options under the Executive, International Executive and Phantom Share Option Schemes was made in April 2003.
Under these Schemes, participants received a bi-annual allocation of options based on their position in the Group.
These options are capable of exercise after at least three years and within 10 years of the date of grant.
The only exceptions are the Phantom Share Options granted on 23 October 1997.
On the exercise of Phantom Options, applicants receive in cash the increase in value of the allocated number of notional shares in the Company.
In total, 15 members of key management held various options as at 28 January 2006.
In addition, all permanent employees excluding those receiving Executive Options were granted options over 400 shares in both 1997 and 1998, provided that they were employed as at 19 March 1997 and in employment on the date of grant.
These options are within the Executive Share Option Scheme.
Under the UK ShareSave Plan, eligible UK employees have been invited to enter into Inland Revenue approved savings contracts for a period of three or five years, whereby shares may be acquired with repayments under the contract.
The option price has been the average market price over three days shortly before an offer to subscribe, discounted by a maximum of 20%.
Options are exercisable within a six month period from the conclusion of a three or five year period.
An International ShareSave Plan, along the lines of the UK ShareSave Plan is available for eligible employees overseas.
There are 8,338 employees in ShareSave Plans, of which 99 are in the International Plan at 28 January 2006.

Since grants under the KIS are made following the year end to which the first year of charge relates, it is not possible to give the number of options granted until after the year end.
2 The weighted average exercise price for options granted during the period represents a blend of nil price KIS options and discounted ShareSave options.
Options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the period.
On that basis, the weighted average share price during the year, rather than at the date of exercise, was 2.49 2005:2.63.
The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average remaining contractual life of 4.23 years 2005: 5.24 years.
The weighted average exercise price for share options outstanding at the end of the year was 1.63 2005: 1.84.
During the year ended 28 January 2006, options were granted on 6 April 2005 and 27 October 2005.
During the year ended 29 January 2005, options were granted on 29 April 2004 and 22 October 2004.
The weighted average fair value of those options at the grant date was 1.32 2005: 1.58.
The fair value of share options and deferred shares is obtained using the Black-Scholes and Stochastic option pricing models.
The inputs into these models are as follows: 2006 2005 Weighted average share price 2.49 2.63 Weighted average exercise price 1.63 1.84 Expected volatility 35% 35% Expected life 3 6yrs 3 6yrs Risk free rate 3.6 4.8% 3.6 4.8% Dividend yield 3.3 5.3% 3.3 5.3% Expected volatility was determined for each individual award, by calculating the historical volatility of the Groups share price immediately prior to the grant of the award, over the same period as the vesting period of each award, adjusted by managements expectation of future volatility.
The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on managements best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised a total expense of 14.1m in the year ended 28 January 2006 2005: 6.8m relating to share-based payment transactions in 2006 and 2005 respectively, of which 14.0m 2005: 6.7m related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions.
The total carrying amount for liabilities arising from cash settled share-based payment transactions at the end of the period was 0.1m 2005: 0.1m.

Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 81 39 Adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39 As explained in note 2, the Group took the option to defer implementation of IAS 32 and IAS 39 until 30 January 2005.
The adoption of IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, with effect from 30 January 2005, results in a change in the Groups accounting policy for financial instruments.
The impact of these standards on the Groups opening balance sheet is shown below.
The principal impact of IAS 32 and IAS 39 on the Groups financial statements relates to the recognition of derivative financial instruments at fair value.
Financial assets and financial liabilities which arise on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting are held on the balance sheet at fair value, with the changes in value reflected through the income statement.
The accounting treatment of derivatives which qualify for hedge accounting depends on how they are designated.
The different accounting treatments are explained below.
Fair value hedges The Group uses interest rate and cross-currency swaps to hedge the exposure to interest rates and currency movements of its issued debt.
Under UK GAAP, derivative financial instruments held for hedging were accounted for using hedge accounting and were not recognised at fair value in the balance sheet.
Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments which meet the fair value hedging requirements are recognised in the balance sheet at fair value, with corresponding fair value movements recognised in the income statement.
For an effective fair value hedge, the hedged item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged, with the corresponding entry in the income statement.
To the extent that the designated hedge relationship is fully effective, the amounts in the income statement offset each other.
As a result, only the ineffective element of any designated hedging relationship impacts the financing line in the income statement.
Cash flow hedges The Group hedges the foreign currency exposure on inventory purchases.
Under UK GAAP, foreign currency derivatives were held off balance sheet.
Under IAS 39, derivative financial instruments which qualify for cash flow hedging are recognised on the balance sheet at fair value, with corresponding fair value changes deferred in equity.
Net investment hedges The gains or losses on the translation of currency borrowings and cross-currency swaps used to hedge the Groups net investments in foreign entities are recognised in equity.
Provided the hedging requirements of IAS 39 are met and the hedging relationship is fully effective, this treatment does not differ from UK GAAP.
On the adoption of IAS 32 and IAS 39, there is no material impact for the Group of other financial assets and liabilities which are not part of a designated hedge relationship.
The adjustments to the opening balance sheet at 30 January 2005 are as follows: Opening balance Effect of adoption of Restated opening sheet under IFRS IAS 32 and IAS 39 position at 30 January 2005 Non-current assets Other receivables 26.6 24.9 51.5 Current assets Trade and other receivables 453.9 1.8 455.7 Current liabilities Trade and other payables 1,698.0 17.9 1,715.9 Non-current liabilities Long-term borrowings 818.3 12.7 831.0 Deferred tax liabilities 192.2 1.7 190.5 Impact on net assets 2.2 Translation reserve 56.1 0.7 56.8 Hedging reserve 4.4 4.4 Retained earnings 1,734.6 1.5 1,736.1 Impact on equity 2.2 82 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Explanation of transition to IFRS Kingfisher plc reported under UK GAAP in its previously published financial statements for the year ended 29 January 2005 and this is the first year that the company has presented its financial statements under IFRS.
The analysis below shows a reconciliation of net assets and profit as reported under UK GAAP as at 29 January 2005 to the revised net assets and profit under IFRS as reported in these financial statements.
A reconciliation of the net assets is provided from UK GAAP to IFRS at the transition date, being 1 February 2004.
The adjustments set out below are those which were notified to investors in the press release dated 17 March 2005 which is available on www.
Previously published IFRS information has been adjusted in accordance with clarification of IAS 21 and recent IFRIC guidance concerning the accounting treatment of fixed minimum rental increases, both of which are described more fully in note 2a.
To aid comparability, the UK GAAP numbers presented below have been reformatted using the new IFRS format rather than the previously disclosed UK GAAP format.

Under UK GAAP, the Groups share of joint venture and associated undertakings operating profit, interest and tax were disclosed separately in the consolidated income statement.
In accordance with IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements, the results of joint venture and associated undertakings have been presented net of interest and tax as a single line item.
There is no effect on the net result for the financial period from this adjustment.
b Intangible assets Goodwill IFRS 3 Business Combinations requires that negative goodwill is recognised immediately in the income statement as opposed to being amortised.
The negative goodwill which arose on the acquisition of the shares in Hornbach has been credited back to opening reserves under IFRS and increases the Groups interest in joint ventures and associates by 19.3m.
The removal of the amortisation credit in the year ended 29 January 2005 reduced profit before tax by 1.0m.
The non-amortisation of positive goodwill required under IFRS has no impact as all positive goodwill held was deemed to have an indefinite life under UK GAAP.
c Intangible assets Computer software Under UK GAAP, all capitalised computer software was included within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet.
Under IFRS, only computer software which is integral to a related item of hardware should be included as property, plant and equipment.
All other computer software should be classified as an intangible asset.
Accordingly, a net balance sheet reclassification has been made of 68.2m at the opening balance sheet date and 69.9m at 29 January 2005 between property, plant and equipment and intangible assets.
There was no impact on the income statement from this reclassification.
Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 85 40 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued d Post employment benefits Under UK GAAP, the Group applied the provisions of SSAP 24 which are significantly different to IAS 19.
As disclosed in note 2a, the Group has elected to early adopt the amendment to IAS 19 Employment Benefits issued by the IASB on 16 December 2004 which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be charged to equity.
Other differences include valuing pension scheme assets at bid value as opposed to mid value and the split of the charge to the income statement between operating service charge and financing return on pension scheme assets and interest on pension liabilities.
The Groups opening IFRS balance sheet reflects the assets and liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes totalling a net liability of 246.3m.
The transitional adjustment of 221.2m to opening reserves comprises the reversal of entries in relation to UK GAAP accounting under SSAP 24 less the recognition of the net liabilities of the Groups defined benefit schemes.
The incremental charge arising from the adoption of IAS 19 on the Groups income statement in the year ended 29 January 2005 was 6m, being the total of 0.9m to operating profit and 5.1m to net financing charges.
The actuarial loss before tax of 79.3m arising in the year ended 29 January 2005 has been recorded in the statement of recognised income and expense.
The pension deficit under IFRS at 29 January 2005 was 325.7m.
e Deferred and current taxes The scope of IAS 12 Income Taxes is wider than the corresponding UK GAAP standards, and requires deferred tax to be provided on temporary differences rather than just taxable timing differences as under UK GAAP.
As a result, the Groups IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 February 2004 included an additional deferred tax liability of 189.1m.
The majority of this adjustment related to the deferred tax provided on the revaluation reserve less the deferred tax asset recognised on the pension deficit at 1 February 2004.
The income tax expense on the face of the consolidated income statement comprises the tax charge of the Company and its subsidiaries under IFRS.
The Groups share of its joint venture and associated undertakings tax charges is shown as part of the share of post tax result of joint ventures and associates within operating profit.
f Share-based payment IFRS 2 Share-based Payment requires that an expense for equity instruments granted is recognised in the income statement based on their fair value at the date of grant, with a corresponding increase in equity.
This expense, which is primarily in relation to employee option and performance share schemes, is recognised over the vesting period of the scheme.
Under UK GAAP, the income statement charge, if any, was based on the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the date of issue with a corresponding increase in accruals.
The Group elected to apply IFRS 2 only to relevant share-based payment transactions granted after 7 November 2002.
The additional pre-tax charge arising from the adoption of IFRS 2 on the Groups income statement for the year ended 29 January 2005 was 1.8m.
The impact from the adoption of this standard is small, as the Group ceased offering share options in 2003 and replaced them with deferred shares for which a charge equating to the market value of the deferred shares was recognised under UK GAAP.
g Capitalisation of building leases IAS 17 Leases requires that the land element of leases on land and buildings is considered separately for the purposes of determining whether the lease is a finance or operating lease.
A majority of the Groups buildings are on leases of 25 years or less which remain as operating under IFRS.
There are a small number of leases greater than 25 years where the building element of the lease has been classified as a finance lease based on the criteria set out in IAS 17.
As a result, the Groups IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 February 2004 includes additional property, plant and equipment of 30.6m and additional finance lease obligations of 47.7m included within current and non-current borrowings.
The main impact on the income statement is that the operating lease payment charged to operating profit under UK GAAP is replaced with a depreciation charge for the asset in operating profit and an interest expense charge in financing costs.
Whilst the total charge for a lease over the life of the lease will be the same under UK GAAP and IFRS, the profile of the charge is different, with the charge being more front loaded under IFRS.
The net pre-tax impact on the income statement for the year ended 29 January 2005 was a further charge of 1.3m.
h Valuation of properties The Group has previously applied a policy of annual revaluations of property under UK GAAP.
The Group has now elected to treat the revalued amount of operating properties at 1 February 2004 as deemed cost as at that date and will not revalue for accounts purposes in future.
The revaluation gain of 175.8m recognised under UK GAAP for the year ended 29 January 2005 was therefore reversed under IFRS.
Investment property was previously revalued annually under UK GAAP.
Following the disposal of the Chartwell Land investment property portfolio in 2003, the amount of investment property now held by the Group is insignificant.
The Group has elected to restate the remaining investment property to historical cost under IFRS.
This results in an increased gain on disposal of properties of 2.9m for the year ended 29 January 2005 under IFRS.
There are no other material impacts of this change on the income statement.
i Lease incentives Under UK GAAP, lease incentives were recognised over the period to the first market rent review.
Under IFRS SIC 15, lease incentives are required to be recognised over the entire lease term.
As a result, the Groups IFRS opening balance sheet at 1 February 2004 includes additional deferred income of 21.7m and operating profit for the year ended 29 January 2005 was reduced by 4.5m.
j Post balance sheet events IAS 10 Events after the Balance Sheet Date requires that dividends approved after the balance sheet date should not be recognised as a liability at that date, as the liability does not represent a present obligation as defined by IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets.
The final dividend declared in March 2004 in relation to the financial year ended 31 January 2004 of 143.4m was reversed in the opening balance sheet and charged to equity in the year ended 29 January 2005.
The final dividend accrued for the year ended 29 January 2005 of 159.7m was reversed in the IFRS balance sheet as at 29 January 2005.
86 Kingfisher plc Annual Report and Accounts 2005 06 Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 40 Explanation of transition to IFRS continued k Inventories IAS 2 requires the inclusion of certain elements of income from suppliers and other similar items in the cost of inventories which is a more encompassing requirement than UK GAAP.
The value of inventories were reduced by 10.8m at 1 February 2004 and 13.0m at 29 January 2005. l Cash IAS 7 Cash Flow Statements defines cash equivalents as being short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Cash deposits with a maturity of less than three months have therefore been reclassified at both balance sheet dates as cash.
m Exceptional items There are no FRS 3 non-operating exceptionals equivalent under IFRS and therefore items not relating to underlying business performance such as property disposal profits and losses are now included within operating profit.
See note 2 a for further information.
n Significant changes to the cash flow statement under IFRS are as follows: Cash flows reported under IFRS and UK GAAP are defined differently under IFRS, cash flows, referred to as cash and cash equivalents, include bank deposits repayable within three months.
Under UK GAAP, these were treated as short-term deposits.
IFRS requires cash flows to be reported under the three headings of operating, investing and financing activities, whereas UK GAAP requires cash flows to be reported in greater detail under the nine standard headings, such as taxation and interest.
IFRS requires foreign currency translation differences to be included on the face of the cash flow statement in order that opening and closing cash and cash equivalent balances may be reconciled.
This is not a requirement under UK GAAP.
